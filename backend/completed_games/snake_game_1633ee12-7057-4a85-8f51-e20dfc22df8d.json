I just moved up twice, so I should re-evaluate the situation.\n\nRationale:\n1. The apple at (0, 7) is still a valid option, but it requires moving through the same path as before.\n2. The apple at (6, 2) is now closer and can be reached without crossing paths with any enemy snakes or walls.\n3. The apple at (6, 0) is also an option, but it's further away than the apple at (6, 2).\n\nNext move: RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to collect the apple at (6, 2) while keeping an eye on enemy snake movements to avoid potential collisions. After getting the apple, I will reassess the situation and decide on the next move.\n\nEnd of turn. Next move: RIGHT, DOWN."

I need to avoid colliding with this snake.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is (9, 8), but it's right above me, and moving up would risk colliding with the enemy snake. The next closest apple is (1, 5), but it's quite a distance away, and I'd need to navigate around the enemy snake to get there.\n\nGiven the current situation, I think it's best to move down and then gradually move left to collect the apple at (0, 7). This way, I can avoid the enemy snake and collect an apple in the process.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move down, then slowly move left towards the apple at (0, 7).\n\nNext move: DOWN."
