Being cautious, I\u2019ll avoid moving towards this snake.\n\n3. **Available Apples**: \n   - Apples at (4, 8), (9, 8), (8, 6), (6, 6), and (6, 5). The closest apple is directly above at (4, 8), which I can reach with my next move.\n\n### New Strategic Thinking:\n- **UP (to 4, 6)**: I will be one step closer to the apple at (4, 8), which is my primary objective.\n- **LEFT (to 3, 6)**: This puts me away from the goal and can lead to unnecessary moves that do not contribute towards the apple collection.\n- **RIGHT (to 5, 6)**: This doesn't contribute to getting the apple and effectively wastes a move.\n- **DOWN (to 4, 4)**: This is moving back and serves no purpose at this moment.\n\nIn summary, my ideal move continues to be moving UP to (4, 6) again, pushing me directly closer toward the apple at (4, 8), which can be obtained in two moves if I continue this strategy.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nMoving UP will not only put me on track to get the apple but also keeps me out of danger.\n\nDecided move: **UP**."

Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 6) allows me to secure an immediate point and positions me favorably for collecting the apple at (8, 6) in subsequent moves. This move maintains central positioning, offering flexibility to navigate towards other apples while minimizing the risk of getting trapped or encountering enemy snakes.\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT"
