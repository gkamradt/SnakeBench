Both of these apples are to the right of our current position. However, I also notice that there is an enemy snake at position (9, 1), which is not a direct threat to us at the moment.\n\nConsidering the available options, I think it's best to target the apple at (8, 6) first. This will allow us to grow and gain a point while also moving closer to the other apple at (8, 5).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (8, 6), we should consider moving down to target the apple at (8, 5).\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
