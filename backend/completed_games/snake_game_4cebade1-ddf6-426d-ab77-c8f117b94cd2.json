This move maintains flexibility for future directions and avoids immediate threats.\n- **LEFT:** Safe and provides a direct path to the apple at (0, 8) in the subsequent move.

It avoids immediate collision risks and keeps escape routes open in multiple directions.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\nAfter moving down to (1, 8), I will evaluate the most efficient path to collect the apple at (0, 8) by moving **LEFT**. Upon collecting this apple, I will reassess the board to prioritize the next closest apple, ensuring that I maintain ample space to navigate safely around enemy snakes and avoid potential collisions. I will also monitor the enemy snake's movements to anticipate and adapt to any threats.\n\n**Decided next move:** DOWN"

However, it positions me closer to potential future apples, such as the one at (6, 5).\n\n- **LEFT:** Moving to (0, 7) would take me back towards my previous position. Depending on whether the cell is occupied by my own body, this could result in a collision. To avoid potential danger, it's best to avoid moving left unless it's confirmed to be safe.\n\n- **RIGHT:** Moving to (2, 7) is within bounds and the cell is empty (`.`). This move is safe and brings me closer to the apple at (3, 7), offering an opportunity to collect another apple in subsequent moves.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n- **UP:** Fatal collision with an obstacle.

Additionally, it maintains flexibility for navigating around enemy snakes and other obstacles on the board.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\nAfter moving right to (2, 7), my focus will be on navigating toward the apple at (3, 7) while monitoring the positions of enemy snakes to avoid potential collisions.

However, it positions me closer to potential future apples, such as the one at (6, 5).\n\n- **LEFT:** Moving to (0, 7) would take me back towards my previous position. Depending on whether the cell is occupied by my own body, this could result in a collision. To avoid potential danger, it's best to avoid moving left unless it's confirmed to be safe.\n\n- **RIGHT:** Moving to (2, 7) is within bounds and the cell is empty (`.`).

This move is safe and strategically positions me closer to the apple at (3, 7), allowing me to accumulate points more effectively in subsequent turns. Additionally, it maintains flexibility for navigating around enemy snakes and other obstacles on the board.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\nAfter moving right to (2, 7), my focus will be on navigating toward the apple at (3, 7) while monitoring the positions of enemy snakes to avoid potential collisions.

Additionally, moving up allows me to occupy higher rows, potentially providing more space to maneuver and reducing the likelihood of getting trapped as the game progresses.\n\n- **DOWN:** Moving to (6, 6) is within bounds, and the cell is empty (`.`). This move is safe and positions me nearer to the apple at (6, 5). However, moving down doesn't lead directly to an apple and might bring me closer to the enemy snake's area in future turns, although there's no immediate threat.\n\n- **LEFT:** Moving to (5, 7) would result in a collision with my own body (`T` at (5, 7)), leading to death. This move is fatal and must be avoided.\n\n- **RIGHT:** Moving to (7, 7) is within bounds, and the cell contains an apple (`A`). This move is safe and allows me to consume the apple immediately, resulting in growth and gaining 1 point. Collecting this apple not only boosts my score but also provides additional space by increasing the length of my snake, which can be advantageous for future maneuvers.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n- **UP:** Safe and leads toward an apple, enhancing my score and positioning me strategically for subsequent moves.\n\n- **DOWN:** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple and may pose future risks by bringing me closer to the enemy snake's vicinity.\n\n- **LEFT:** Fatal collision with my own body. Not viable.\n\n- **RIGHT:** Safe and results in immediate apple consumption, providing both a score advantage and increased snake length for better maneuverability.\n\n**Decision:** Moving **RIGHT** to (7, 7) is the optimal choice. This move is safe, allows me to consume the apple immediately, and strategically positions me for future moves by increasing my length and maintaining flexibility in navigation.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\nAfter moving right to (7, 7) and consuming the apple, I will reassess the board to identify the next closest apple. Potential targets include:\n\n- **Apple at (6, 9):** Moving upwards to collect this apple will help avoid congestion near the center and position me favorably for accessing other apples.\n\n- **Apple at (9, 6):** If the path remains clear, heading towards the right edge can be beneficial for accessing multiple apples with minimal movement.\n\nI'll continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements to ensure I maintain a safe distance and avoid potential collisions. Additionally, I'll plan my path to maximize the collection of apples while minimizing the risk of getting trapped by my own body or the boundaries of the board. Maintaining a strategic balance between aggression in collecting apples and caution to preserve my snake's integrity will be crucial for maximizing my score.\n\n**Decided next move:** RIGHT"
