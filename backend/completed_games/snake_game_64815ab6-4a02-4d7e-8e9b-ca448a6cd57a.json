However, moving towards that apple would put me in a dangerous position, as the enemy snake (snake #2) is at (8, 9) with its body at (8, 8) and (7, 8).\n\nThe next closest apple is at (5, 4), which is 4 steps away. Moving towards that apple would also put me in close proximity to the enemy snake.\n\nThe other apples are at (0, 6), (9, 9), and (1, 5). The apple at (9, 9) is the furthest away, and the one at (0, 6) is also relatively close to the enemy snake.\n\nGiven the risk of running into the enemy snake, I think the safest move would be to go for the apple at (1, 5). This will allow me to gain a point without too much danger, and it will also keep me relatively far from the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn would be to continue moving towards the apple at (1, 5) and then assess the situation again to see if I can move towards a different apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: LEFT."

The enemy snake is not in a position to interfere with either move\n\nFor next turn:\nAfter moving RIGHT and capturing the apple, I'll likely want to start moving down and left towards the (5, 4) apple, as it will be the closest target.\n\nDecision:\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 9) to capture the apple. This is a safe and immediate point gain, and positions me to start moving towards the next closest apple.\n\nRIGHT"
