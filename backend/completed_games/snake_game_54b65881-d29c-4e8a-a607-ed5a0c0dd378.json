I see that there's an apple at (0, 0) which is right in front of me, and another one at (7, 1) which is a bit further away.\n\nMy current position is relatively safe, but I should try to move towards the apple at (0, 0) to gain some points and grow my snake. However, I should also keep an eye on the other snakes, especially Snake #1, which is at (7, 3).\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the apple at (0, 0) and try to avoid any potential collisions with Snake #1.\n\nSince I'm currently at (0, 1) and the apple is at (0, 0), I should move down to reach it. I'll move down to avoid Snake #1 and try to get closer to the apple.\n\nMy decided next move is: DOWN."
