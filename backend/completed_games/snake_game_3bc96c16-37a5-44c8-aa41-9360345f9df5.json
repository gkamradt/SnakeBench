However, I must also consider the position of Snake #2, which is above and to the right of me.\n\nMoving UP or RIGHT would be dangerous as it could potentially put me in the path of Snake #2. Moving DOWN is safe but does not lead to an apple immediately. Moving LEFT is the best option as it will allow me to collect the apple at (2, 6) in the next turn without putting me in immediate danger.\n\nAfter moving left, I will be at (1, 8), and my strategy for the next turn will be to move LEFT again to collect the apple at (0, 2). I will need to continue monitoring the movements of Snake #2 to ensure I do not inadvertently move into its path.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be: LEFT."

The enemy snake is at (2, 8), which is not in the immediate path of the snake if it moves down.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move down to reach the apple at (4, 8). Once the apple is reached, assess the board for the next best move, keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position and the other apples.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
