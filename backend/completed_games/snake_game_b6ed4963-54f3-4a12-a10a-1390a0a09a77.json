That would be a loss.\nMoving DOWN would put me at (3, 3), which is empty and safe.\nMoving LEFT would put me at (2, 4), which is empty and safe.  The apple at (2,2) is reasonably close in that direction.\nMoving RIGHT would put me at (4, 4), which is empty and safe.\n\nThe apple at (2,2) looks tempting, and getting there from my current position doesn't look particularly dangerous. I'll start heading in that general direction.\n\n\nNext move: LEFT"
