            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,8). There are apples at (1,6), (6,4), (0,7), (9,8), and (2,2). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLooking at my position, (7,8), that's towards the top-right of the board. There's an apple at (9,8), which is directly to my right, and another one at (6,4), which is below and to the left of me.\n\nBut I need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (5,4). I don't want to run into it or myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . 2 . A (my position is 2, apple at 9)\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . . (apple at 0)\n\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . . (apple at 1)\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . 1 A . . . (enemy at 5, apple at 6)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . . (apple at 2)\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,8), and the apples are at (1,6), (6,4), (0,7), (9,8), and (2,2). Enemy snake is at (5,4).\n\nI need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving right to eat the apple at (9,8). That seems straightforward, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nFrom (7,8), moving right would be to (8,8), then (9,8). Let's see what's at (8,8). According to the board, it's empty. So, I can move right to (8,8), then to (9,8) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (9,8), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to pick up other apples. For example, moving down to row 7, where there's an apple at (0,7).\n\nLet's think about that. From (7,8), down to (7,7), then left towards (0,7). But that seems like a long way, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nWait, but currently, my body is just the head at (7,8), right? Because no body parts are listed.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, usually, the snake has a body that follows the head. But in this case, it seems like my snake is just the head, maybe because it's\u521a started or something.\n\nWait, maybe the snake body is not listed here. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, at row 8, column 7, there's a 2, which is my snake, and at row 8, column 9, there's an apple.\n\nRow 7 has an apple at column 0.\n\nRow 6 has an apple at column 1.\n\nRow 4 has an apple at column 6 and enemy snake at column 5.\n\nRow 2 has an apple at column 2.\n\nSo, I need to plan a path to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nSince I'm at (7,8), and the apple at (9,8) is right next to me, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nFrom (7,8), move right to (8,8), then to (9,8) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so my tail will be at (7,8).\n\nThen, I can continue moving right, but there's no more space beyond (9,8), so I need to turn down or something.\n\nWait, but at (9,8), if I eat the apple, my head is at (9,8), and my tail is still at (7,8).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, and your head moves forward, but your snake grows by one segment.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the next move after eating the apple, your tail stays where it was, and your head moves forward.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, maybe it's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of my snake's length increasing after eating an apple.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I move right to (8,8), then to (9,8) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so now my snake has two segments: head at (9,8) and tail at (8,8).\n\nThen, next move, if I move up or down or left or right, the tail moves to where the head was.\n\nWait, but in this game, it seems like the snake only has a head and no body, based on the board representation.\n\nWait, looking back, the board shows only the head as '2', and apples as 'A', and empty spaces as '.'.\n\nSo perhaps in this variant, the snake doesn't have a body until it eats an apple.\n\nWait, but in classic Snake, the snake has a body that follows the head.\n\nMaybe I need to confirm the rules.\n\nLooking back, rule 1 says: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nRule 2: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, it implies that the snake has a body that can be run into yourself.\n\nBut in the board, only the head is shown, so maybe the body is not visible or not listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this game, the snake starts with only the head, and eating an apple increases its length by one segment.\n\nBut to confirm, let's assume that initially, the snake only has the head, and as it eats apples, its body grows.\n\nSo, for now, my snake only has the head at (7,8), and no body.\n\nIf I eat the apple at (9,8), my snake will grow, so now it has a body segment at (7,8) and head at (9,8).\n\nThen, next move, if I move right again, the tail would move to (8,8), and head to (10,8), but that's off the board, so I'd die.\n\nWait, no, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9), so (10,8) is off the board.\n\nSo, that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (9,8), I could move down to (9,7), then (9,6), and so on, to pick up other apples.\n\nBut looking at the board, there are no apples in row 7, column 9 is empty.\n\nWait, row 8, column 9 has the apple.\n\nRow 7, column 0 has an apple.\n\nRow 6, column 1 has an apple.\n\nRow 4, column 6 has an apple.\n\nRow 2, column 2 has an apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (9,8), then move down to collect the one at (6,4), avoiding the enemy snake at (5,4).\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to row 7, collect the apple at (0,7), but that's way over there.\n\nThat might take too many moves, and I might be vulnerable to the enemy snake.\n\nWait, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves as well.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,4), and it can move in any of the four directions, assuming it's trying to eat apples and not collide with me or itself.\n\nBut since it's an enemy snake, I should assume it's hostile and might try to cut me off or something.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, I can plan my path assuming it stays still or moves randomly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut that might be too complex for now.\n\nMaybe I should focus on collecting the closest apples first.\n\nThe closest apple is at (9,8), which is right next to me.\n\nSo, moving right to (8,8), then to (9,8) to eat it.\n\nAfter eating it,"

There are apples at (1,6), (0,7), (9,8), (2,2), and (9,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (6,4), with a body part at (5,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,8), that's towards the top-right of the board. There's an apple at (9,8), which is directly to my right, and another one at (6,4), which is below and to the left of me.\n\nBut I need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (6,4), with a body part at (5,4). So, it's possible that the enemy snake has grown.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . 2 . A (my position is 2, apple at 9)\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . . (apple at 0)\n\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . . (apple at 1)\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . T 1 . . . (enemy at 5, apple at 6)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . . (apple at 2)\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (8,8), and the apples are at (1,6), (0,7), (9,8), (2,2), and (9,6). Enemy snake is at (6,4) with a body part at (5,4).\n\nI need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving right to eat the apple at (9,8). That seems straightforward, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nFrom (8,8), moving right would be to (9,8), where the apple is. After eating it, my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (8,8).\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to avoid hitting my own tail or the walls.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to pick up other apples. For example, moving down to row 7, where there's an apple at (0,7).\n\nLet's think about that. From (8,8), down to (8,7), then left towards (0,7). But that seems like a long way, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nWait, but currently, my body is just the tail at (8,8) after eating the apple at (9,8).\n\nI need to think ahead. If I eat the apple at (9,8), my head will be at (9,8), and my tail will be at (8,8). Then, if I move down to (9,7), my tail will move to (9,8), where the apple was.\n\nWait, no, in Snake games, when you move, the tail moves forward to where the head was previously, unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail stays for one move.\n\nActually, I need to recall how Snake works. When you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place for that move, and then subsequent moves, the tail moves forward.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, perhaps it's different.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I move right to (9,8), eat the apple, now my snake has a length of 2: head at (9,8) and tail at (8,8).\n\nThen, if I move up to (9,9), my head moves to (9,9), and the tail moves to (9,8).\n\nIf there's something at (9,9), like another snake or a wall, I die.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right from (9,8) to (10,8), that's off the board, so I die.\n\nSo, moving right after eating the apple is not safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), which is empty, so that's safe.\n\nThen, I can continue moving down to (9,6), where there's another apple.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 9, column 6 is empty, but there's an apple at (9,6). Wait, earlier you mentioned apples at (1,6), (0,7), (9,8), (2,2), and (9,6).\n\nBut in the board representation, row 6, column 9 is empty, but there's an apple at (9,6). Maybe that's a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple at (9,6) is at row 6, column 9, which would be (9,6), since columns are x-coordinates and rows are y-coordinates.\n\nWait, no, in the board, rows are y-coordinates, columns are x-coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board, row 9 is y=9, column 0 to 9.\n\nSo, position (9,6) would be row 6, column 9.\n\nBut in the board, row 6, column 9 is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion in coordinates.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, coordinates are (x,y), with (0,0) at bottom left and (9,9) at top right.\n\nSo, x increases to the right, y increases upwards.\n\nIn the board representation, row 9 is y=9, column 0 to 9 corresponds to x=0 to x=9.\n\nSo, position (9,6) is x=9, y=6, which is row 6, column 9.\n\nBut in the board, row 6, column 9 is empty, not an apple.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the board representation or in the apple positions.\n\nWait, in the problem, apples are at (1,6), (0,7), (9,8), (2,2), (9,6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . 2 . A \u2192 apple at (9,8)\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . . \u2192 apple at (0,7)\n\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . . \u2192 apple at (1,6)\n\nRow 4: . . . . . T 1 . . . \u2192 enemy at (5,4), apple at (6,4)\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . . \u2192 apple at (2,2)\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, apple at (9,6) is not shown on the board. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is transposed.\n\nWait, perhaps the board is represented with rows and columns swapped.\n\nWait, in the board, row 8, column 7 is 2, which corresponds to (7,8), but in the problem, it's (8,8).\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion in indexing.\n\nWait, in programming, rows usually correspond to y-coordinates, and columns to x-coordinates.\n\nSo, position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nSo, (8,8) is column 8, row 8.\n\nBut in the board, row 8, column 7 is 2, which should be (7,8), matching the problem statement.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust my understanding.\n\nGiven that, position (9,6) would be column 9, row 6.\n\nLooking at the board, row 6, column 9 is empty, not an apple.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple at (9,6) is missing in the board representation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple is at (6,9), which is row 9, column 6.\n\nBut in the problem, it's listed as (9,6), which would be column 9, row 6.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a confusion in notation.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll consider positions as (x,y), with x increasing to the right and y increasing upwards, starting from (0,0) at bottom left.\n\nGiven that, the board should be interpreted accordingly.\n\nNow, back to decision making.\n\nI'm at (8,8), and I can move to (9,8), (8,9), (7,8), or (8,7).\n\nBut first, I need to see what's around me.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (9,8): apple\n\n- (8,9): empty\n\n- (7,8): empty\n\n- (8,7): empty"
