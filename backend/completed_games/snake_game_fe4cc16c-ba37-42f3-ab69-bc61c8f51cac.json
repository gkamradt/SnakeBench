Looking at the board now, here\u2019s what we have:\n\n\u2022 Our head: (6,7)\n\u2022 Apples: (6,4), (0,6), (4,0), (5,6), (5,2)\n\u2022 Enemy snake #2 is at (4,3) with a body cell at (3,3)\n\u2022 Our own snake body forms obstacles (the \u201cT\u201d marks)\n\nFrom (6,7) let\u2019s check the four potential moves:\n\n\u20031. UP: (6,8) \u2013 That cell is occupied by our own body (it was our old head position), so it\u2019s unsafe.\n\u20032. DOWN: (6,6) \u2013 This cell is free. If we move down, our head would be at (6,6); from there, our target apple (5,6) is one left (distance: |6\u20135|+|6\u20136| = 1).  \n\u20033. LEFT: (5,7) \u2013 This cell is also free and going left would immediately decrease the x distance toward apple (5,6). From (5,7), the apple (5,6) is directly below (distance = 1).  \n\u20034. RIGHT: (7,7) \u2013 Free, but it doesn\u2019t bring us any closer to an apple.\n\nNow, let\u2019s evaluate our target. The closest apple is at (5,6):\n\n\u2003\u2022 From (6,7), the Manhattan distance to (5,6) is 1 (x) + 1 (y) = 2 moves.\n\nBoth moving DOWN and LEFT will yield a new position with a Manhattan distance of 1 to the apple. However, moving LEFT (to (5,7)) immediately sets us in a direct vertical alignment with the apple. Once we\u2019re at (5,7), simply moving DOWN will secure the apple at the next turn.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe and get us closer toward our target\u2014with no risk from enemy snakes\u2014my chosen plan is to go LEFT.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
