The next apple I need to keep an eye on is at (9, 4), which is one cell to my right (east) and one cell up (north).\n2. **Relevant Threats:** Snake #2 is at (6, 5) and there's a body segment at (6, 6). Their position does not directly endanger my immediate upcoming move but must be monitored for future turns.\n3. **Potential Moves:**\n   - **UP to (8, 4):** This doesn't lead to any apples and only increases my distance. It puts me further away from collecting apples.\n   - **DOWN to (8, 2):** This would be returning to my previous position with no benefits.\n   - **LEFT to (7, 3):** Movement in this direction might provide additional avenues but doesn\u2019t lead to any apples.\n   - **RIGHT to (9, 3):** There are no apples at (9, 3), but moving here opens up the possibility of moving to (9, 4) for the next apple.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nTo best collect apples while maintaining a good position away from enemy threats, I will move RIGHT to (9, 4).
