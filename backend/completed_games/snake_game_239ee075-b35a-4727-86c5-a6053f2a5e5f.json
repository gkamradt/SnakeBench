It is the most logical target due to proximity.\n2. **(5, 6)**: This requires navigating to the left and up, but it's farther in terms of moves required.\n3. **(4, 1)** and **(2, 2)**: Both are farther away, involving more directional changes.\n4. **(0, 6)**: The farthest on the board, making it a low-priority target.\n\nPotential Risks:\n- Snake #2 is not in my immediate pathway, so I should not worry about collisions for the next couple of moves.\n- Ensure not to corner myself, particularly after moving downwards, by having an escape plan after collecting the apple.\n\nStrategy:\n- My immediate goal should be to collect the apple at (6, 1), as it provides a quick opportunity to grow with minimal moves.\n- After collecting the apple at (6, 1), assess the board and potentially consider the next target based on newly spawned apples or proximity to other remaining apples.\n- Maintain vigilance for any changes in the board, especially around the walls or edges.\n\nNext Move Decision:\nThe logical move is to continue the plan and move DOWN to collect the apple at (6, 1), which aligns with my current strategic analysis.\n\nDecided Next Move: DOWN"

It doesn't pose an immediate threat in my current region but I should remain aware of its potential movements.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Immediate Apple Collection:**\n   - Moving left to collect the apple at (1, 1) is a straightforward choice, as it is only one move away and offers immediate growth.\n\n2. **Positioning:**\n   - After securing the apple at (1, 1), consider moving upwards along the left side of the board to target the apple at (2, 2). This avoids crowding the center or potential encounters with Snake #2, which is more centered around (5, 6).\n\n3. **Risk Mitigation:**\n   - Keep an eye on the snake positions to ensure I am not inadvertently heading into regions where Snake #2 could be moving.\n   - Ensure I leave myself options to turn around or redirect if necessary, particularly after reaching the edges or corners.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the proximity of the apple at (1, 1) and the minimal risk posed by Snake #2, my best move is to head LEFT to secure that apple immediately.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

I could pursue this immediately.\n- (3, 8) and (4, 7): These apples are farther away and upwards, requiring significant navigation.\n\n**Enemy Snakes:**\n- Snake #2 is at (5, 6) with a trailing position at (6, 6). It doesn't pose an immediate threat in my current region but I should remain aware of its potential movements.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Immediate Apple Collection:**\n   - Moving left to collect the apple at (1, 1) is a straightforward choice, as it is only one move away and offers immediate growth.\n\n2. **Positioning:**\n   - After securing the apple at (1, 1), consider moving upwards along the left side of the board to target the apple at (2, 2). This avoids crowding the center or potential encounters with Snake #2, which is more centered around (5, 6).\n\n3. **Risk Mitigation:**\n   - Keep an eye on the snake positions to ensure I am not inadvertently heading into regions where Snake #2 could be moving.\n   - Ensure I leave myself options to turn around or redirect if necessary, particularly after reaching the edges or corners.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the proximity of the apple at (1, 1) and the minimal risk posed by Snake #2, my best move is to head LEFT to secure that apple immediately.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"
