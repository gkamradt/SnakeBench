Board Positioning\n   - UP move maintains good board control\n   - Prevents getting cornered or limited in movement options\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- UP move minimizes immediate collision risks\n- Preserves multiple movement and apple collection paths\n- Provides tactical flexibility for next turns\n\nPotential Next Turn Strategy:\n- After UP move, look to create a safe path to left-side apples\n- Continue monitoring enemy snake's movements\n- Maintain board positioning that allows multiple strategic options\n\nDecision Rationale:\n- Safety from enemy snake\n- Preservation of movement options\n- Potential future apple collection routes\n\nNext move decision: UP provides the most balanced and strategic approach.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
