There are no other snakes or walls in the way. I'm moving in the correct direction toward the apple. I should continue in this direction until I reach it or another snake/obstacle.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving down until I eat the apple at (1,6), hit an obstacle, or the apple is no longer reachable in that direction.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

If I move left to (2,7), the enemy snake might move right to (2,7) in the next turn, and I want to avoid collision.
