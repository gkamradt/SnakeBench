There are apples at (3,7), (1,2), (9,3), (1,1), and (1,5). Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,1) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . A . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,7): Row 7, Column 3\n\n- (1,2): Row 2, Column 1\n\n- (9,3): Row 3, Column 9\n\n- (1,1): Row 1, Column 1\n\n- (1,5): Row 5, Column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is Row 1, Column 8.\n\nI'm at (4,2), which is Row 2, Column 4.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of their distance from my current position, so I can prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nCalculate distances using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves in grid steps):\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 3.\n\nNext is (1,1), distance 4.\n\nThen, (3,7), (9,3), and (1,5), all at distance 6.\n\nBut wait, apple at (1,2) is at Row 2, Column 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nFirst, check if I can move left towards (3,2). Is that safe?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,2) is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Row 2, Column 1, which is two steps to the left from my current position.\n\nBut immediately to my left is (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBut if I move left to (3,2), then next I can move left again to (2,2), then (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,1). It's quite far away, and it doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I should keep an eye on it in case it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor now, since it's far, I'll focus on getting the closest apple at (1,2).\n\nSo, my plan is to move left towards (3,2), then continue left to (2,2), then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or myself in those positions.\n\nWait, my snake is currently at (4,2), and I'm assuming it's just the head, since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,2) should be safe.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't hit myself if I make a wrong turn later.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (1,2), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (1,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Column 1, Row 2.\n\nI'm at Column 4, Row 2.\n\nSo, to get from (4,2) to (1,2), I need to move left three times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,2) and (1,2), there are positions (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): safe\n\n- Left to (2,2): safe\n\n- Left to (1,2): apple\n\nSo, I can safely move left three times to get to the apple at (1,2).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once.\n\nSo, I should move left towards (3,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, move left again to (2,2), and then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nAlso, since I'm just starting, my body is only the head, so I won't run into myself.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider if there are any better options.\n\nIs there another apple that's closer or easier to get?\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (1,1): distance 4\n\n- (1,5): distance 6\n\n- (3,7): distance 6\n\n- (9,3): distance 6\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is the closest, so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAlso, moving towards (1,2) might position me well to go for (1,1) next, which is nearby.\n\nAfter getting (1,2), I can consider moving down to (1,1) to get another apple.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nMove left to (3,2)\n\nThen left to (2,2)\n\nThen left to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,2).\n\nThen, to get (1,1), I can move down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nAt that point, my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nSo, moving down to (1,1) is safe.\n\nThen, after eating (1,1), my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nNext, I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest might be (3,7), but that's distance 6 from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's (9,3), which is also distance 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a better path.\n\nWait, after getting (1,2) and (1,1), I'm at (1,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (1,5) is distance 4.\n\nWhile (3,7) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (1,1) to (1,5):\n\n|1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nTo (3,7): |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (9,3): |1-9| + |1-3| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest next apple from (1,1).\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,1). Hmm, looking at the board layout:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at Row 1, Column 4, which is (4,1). Wait, but in the board layout, Row 2 shows (2,4) as my position, but according to the coordinates, it should be (4,1). There seems to be a confusion here.\n\nWait, let's clarify the coordinates. The board is listed with Row 9 at the top and Row 0 at the bottom, with columns 0 to 9 from left to right. So, position (x,y) means column x, row y.\n\nIn the board layout, position (4,1) is indeed Row 1, Column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,7): Row 7, Column 3\n\n- (1,2): Row 2, Column 1\n\n- (9,3): Row 3, Column 9\n\n- (1,1): Row 1, Column 1\n\n- (1,5): Row 5, Column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is Row 1, Column 8.\n\nOkay, so I need to plan my moves to collect apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple is closest to me. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,1) to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |1-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,1), with a distance of 3. The next closest is (1,2) at distance 4.\n\nI should consider going for (1,1) first since it's closer.\n\nNow, to get from (4,1) to (1,1), I need to move left three times:\n\n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in that path, as per the board layout.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check:\n\n- From (4,1), moving left to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied?\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1, Column 3 is empty.\n\n- Then to (2,1): Row 1, Column 2 is empty.\n\n- Finally to (1,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, it's safe to move left three times to get to (1,1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once. So, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,1), my body will extend, and I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern since I'm just starting.\n\nAlright, so my first move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's another apple at (1,2), which is directly above (1,1).\n\nAfter getting (1,1), I can consider moving up to (1,2) next, to collect that apple as well.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the next apple\n\nThat seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,1), I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (1,1), my tail will be at (2,1), assuming I move from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nSo, when I'm at (1,1), my body is:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous position at (2,1)\n\nThen, moving up to (1,2), which is the next apple.\n\nIs (1,2) clear? Looking at the board, it's an apple, so it's clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body will be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Previous head at (1,1)\n\n- Tail at (2,1)\n\nThen, I can consider moving to the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,7): distance from (1,2) is |1-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (9,3): |1-9| + |2-3| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (1,5): |1-1| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the closest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nFrom (1,2), to get to (1,5), I need to move up three times:\n\n(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nCurrently, enemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is far away. Assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on collecting apples efficiently is the priority.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n5. Move up to (1,3)\n\n6. Move up to (1,4)\n\n7. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,1), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

There are apples at (3,7), (1,2), (9,3), (1,1), and (1,5). Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,1) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . A . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,7): Row 7, Column 3\n\n- (1,2): Row 2, Column 1\n\n- (9,3): Row 3, Column 9\n\n- (1,1): Row 1, Column 1\n\n- (1,5): Row 5, Column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is Row 1, Column 8.\n\nI'm at (4,2), which is Row 2, Column 4.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of their distance from my current position, so I can prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nCalculate distances using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves in grid steps):\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 3.\n\nNext is (1,1), distance 4.\n\nThen, (3,7), (9,3), and (1,5), all at distance 6.\n\nBut wait, apple at (1,2) is at Row 2, Column 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nFirst, check if I can move left towards (3,2). Is that safe?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,2) is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Row 2, Column 1, which is two steps to the left from my current position.\n\nBut immediately to my left is (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBut if I move left to (3,2), then next I can move left again to (2,2), then (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,1). It's quite far away, and it doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I should keep an eye on it in case it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor now, since it's far, I'll focus on getting the closest apple at (1,2).\n\nSo, my plan is to move left towards (3,2), then continue left to (2,2), then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or myself in those positions.\n\nWait, my snake is currently at (4,2), and I'm assuming it's just the head, since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,2) should be safe.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't hit myself if I make a wrong turn later.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (1,2), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (1,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Column 1, Row 2.\n\nI'm at Column 4, Row 2.\n\nSo, to get from (4,2) to (1,2), I need to move left three times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,2) and (1,2), there are positions (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): safe\n\n- Left to (2,2): safe\n\n- Left to (1,2): apple\n\nSo, I can safely move left three times to get to the apple at (1,2).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once.\n\nSo, I should move left towards (3,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, move left again to (2,2), and then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nAlso, since I'm just starting, my body is only the head, so I won't run into myself.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider if there are any better options.\n\nIs there another apple that's closer or easier to get?\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (1,1): distance 4\n\n- (1,5): distance 6\n\n- (3,7): distance 6\n\n- (9,3): distance 6\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is the closest, so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAlso, moving towards (1,2) might position me well to go for (1,1) next, which is nearby.\n\nAfter getting (1,2), I can consider moving down to (1,1) to get another apple.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nMove left to (3,2)\n\nThen left to (2,2)\n\nThen left to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,2).\n\nThen, to get (1,1), I can move down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nAt that point, my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nSo, moving down to (1,1) is safe.\n\nThen, after eating (1,1), my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nNext, I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest might be (3,7), but that's distance 6 from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's (9,3), which is also distance 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a better path.\n\nWait, after getting (1,2) and (1,1), I'm at (1,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (1,5) is distance 4.\n\nWhile (3,7) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (1,1) to (1,5):\n\n|1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nTo (3,7): |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (9,3): |1-9| + |1-3| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest next apple from (1,1).\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1"

Assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on collecting apples efficiently is the priority.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n5. Move up to (1,3)\n\n6. Move up to (1,4)\n\n7. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,1), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,1). Wait, in the last move information, it said (4,1), but according to the board layout, it seems like I'm at (3,1). Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (3,1) to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |3-3| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |3-1| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |3-9| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |3-1| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |3-1| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,1), with a distance of 2. The next closest is (1,2) at distance 3.\n\nI should consider going for (1,1) first since it's closer.\n\nNow, to get from (3,1) to (1,1), I need to move left two times:\n\n(3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in that path, as per the board layout.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check:\n\n- From (3,1), moving left to (2,1): is (2,1) occupied?\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1, Column 2 is empty.\n\n- Then to (1,1): Row 1, Column 1 is an apple.\n\nSo, it's safe to move left two times to get to (1,1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once. So, I should move left to (2,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,1), my body will extend, and I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern since I'm just starting.\n\nAlright, so my first move should be to the left, towards (2,1).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's another apple at (1,2), which is directly above (1,1).\n\nAfter getting (1,1), I can consider moving up to (1,2) next, to collect that apple as well.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (2,1)\n\n2. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n3. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\nThat seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,1), I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (1,1), my tail will be at (2,1), assuming I move from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nSo, when I'm at (1,1), my body is:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous position at (2,1)\n\nThen, moving up to (1,2), which is the next apple.\n\nIs (1,2) clear?

Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (2,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (9,2), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (2,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Continue moving left to (1,1) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, move up to (1,2) to eat the next apple.\n\n- After that, proceed up to (1,5), as it's the closest remaining apple.\n\n- Monitor the position of enemy snake 1 and adjust path if necessary to avoid collisions.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

There are apples at (3,7), (1,2), (9,3), (1,1), and (1,5). Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,1) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . A . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: .

Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 3.\n\nNext is (1,1), distance 4.\n\nThen, (3,7), (9,3), and (1,5), all at distance 6.\n\nBut wait, apple at (1,2) is at Row 2, Column 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nFirst, check if I can move left towards (3,2). Is that safe?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,2) is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Row 2, Column 1, which is two steps to the left from my current position.\n\nBut immediately to my left is (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBut if I move left to (3,2), then next I can move left again to (2,2), then (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,1). It's quite far away, and it doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I should keep an eye on it in case it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor now, since it's far, I'll focus on getting the closest apple at (1,2).\n\nSo, my plan is to move left towards (3,2), then continue left to (2,2), then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or myself in those positions.\n\nWait, my snake is currently at (4,2), and I'm assuming it's just the head, since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,2) should be safe.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't hit myself if I make a wrong turn later.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (1,2), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (1,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Column 1, Row 2.\n\nI'm at Column 4, Row 2.\n\nSo, to get from (4,2) to (1,2), I need to move left three times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,2) and (1,2), there are positions (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): safe\n\n- Left to (2,2): safe\n\n- Left to (1,2): apple\n\nSo, I can safely move left three times to get to the apple at (1,2).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once.\n\nSo, I should move left towards (3,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, move left again to (2,2), and then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nAlso, since I'm just starting, my body is only the head, so I won't run into myself.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider if there are any better options.\n\nIs there another apple that's closer or easier to get?\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (1,1): distance 4\n\n- (1,5): distance 6\n\n- (3,7): distance 6\n\n- (9,3): distance 6\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is the closest, so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAlso, moving towards (1,2) might position me well to go for (1,1) next, which is nearby.\n\nAfter getting (1,2), I can consider moving down to (1,1) to get another apple.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nMove left to (3,2)\n\nThen left to (2,2)\n\nThen left to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,2).\n\nThen, to get (1,1), I can move down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nAt that point, my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nSo, moving down to (1,1) is safe.\n\nThen, after eating (1,1), my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nNext, I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest might be (3,7), but that's distance 6 from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's (9,3), which is also distance 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a better path.\n\nWait, after getting (1,2) and (1,1), I'm at (1,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (1,5) is distance 4.\n\nWhile (3,7) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (1,1) to (1,5):\n\n|1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nTo (3,7): |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (9,3): |1-9| + |1-3| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest next apple from (1,1).\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1"

Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,1), with a distance of 3. The next closest is (1,2) at distance 4.\n\nI should consider going for (1,1) first since it's closer.\n\nNow, to get from (4,1) to (1,1), I need to move left three times:\n\n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in that path, as per the board layout.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check:\n\n- From (4,1), moving left to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied?\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1, Column 3 is empty.\n\n- Then to (2,1): Row 1, Column 2 is empty.\n\n- Finally to (1,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, it's safe to move left three times to get to (1,1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once. So, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,1), my body will extend, and I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern since I'm just starting.\n\nAlright, so my first move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's another apple at (1,2), which is directly above (1,1).\n\nAfter getting (1,1), I can consider moving up to (1,2) next, to collect that apple as well.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the next apple\n\nThat seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,1), I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (1,1), my tail will be at (2,1), assuming I move from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nSo, when I'm at (1,1), my body is:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous position at (2,1)\n\nThen, moving up to (1,2), which is the next apple.\n\nIs (1,2) clear? Looking at the board, it's an apple, so it's clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body will be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Previous head at (1,1)\n\n- Tail at (2,1)\n\nThen, I can consider moving to the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,7): distance from (1,2) is |1-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (9,3): |1-9| + |2-3| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (1,5): |1-1| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the closest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nFrom (1,2), to get to (1,5), I need to move up three times:\n\n(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nCurrently, enemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is far away. Assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on collecting apples efficiently is the priority.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n5. Move up to (1,3)\n\n6. Move up to (1,4)\n\n7. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,1), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

There are apples at (3,7), (1,2), (9,3), (1,1), and (1,5). Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,1) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 3.\n\nNext is (1,1), distance 4.\n\nThen, (3,7), (9,3), and (1,5), all at distance 6.\n\nBut wait, apple at (1,2) is at Row 2, Column 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nFirst, check if I can move left towards (3,2). Is that safe?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,2) is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Row 2, Column 1, which is two steps to the left from my current position.\n\nBut immediately to my left is (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBut if I move left to (3,2), then next I can move left again to (2,2), then (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,1). It's quite far away, and it doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I should keep an eye on it in case it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor now, since it's far, I'll focus on getting the closest apple at (1,2).\n\nSo, my plan is to move left towards (3,2), then continue left to (2,2), then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or myself in those positions.\n\nWait, my snake is currently at (4,2), and I'm assuming it's just the head, since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,2) should be safe.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't hit myself if I make a wrong turn later.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (1,2), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (1,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Column 1, Row 2.\n\nI'm at Column 4, Row 2.\n\nSo, to get from (4,2) to (1,2), I need to move left three times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,2) and (1,2), there are positions (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): safe\n\n- Left to (2,2): safe\n\n- Left to (1,2): apple\n\nSo, I can safely move left three times to get to the apple at (1,2).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once.\n\nSo, I should move left towards (3,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, move left again to (2,2), and then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nAlso, since I'm just starting, my body is only the head, so I won't run into myself.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider if there are any better options.\n\nIs there another apple that's closer or easier to get?\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (1,1): distance 4\n\n- (1,5): distance 6\n\n- (3,7): distance 6\n\n- (9,3): distance 6\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is the closest, so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAlso, moving towards (1,2) might position me well to go for (1,1) next, which is nearby.\n\nAfter getting (1,2), I can consider moving down to (1,1) to get another apple.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nMove left to (3,2)\n\nThen left to (2,2)\n\nThen left to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,2).\n\nThen, to get (1,1), I can move down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nAt that point, my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nSo, moving down to (1,1) is safe.\n\nThen, after eating (1,1), my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nNext, I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest might be (3,7), but that's distance 6 from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's (9,3), which is also distance 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a better path.\n\nWait, after getting (1,2) and (1,1), I'm at (1,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (1,5) is distance 4.\n\nWhile (3,7) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (1,1) to (1,5):\n\n|1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nTo (3,7): |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (9,3): |1-9| + |1-3| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest next apple from (1,1).\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,1). Hmm, looking at the board layout:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at Row 1, Column 4, which is (4,1). Wait, but in the board layout, Row 2 shows (2,4) as my position, but according to the coordinates, it should be (4,1). There seems to be a confusion here.\n\nWait, let's clarify the coordinates. The board is listed with Row 9 at the top and Row 0 at the bottom, with columns 0 to 9 from left to right. So, position (x,y) means column x, row y.\n\nIn the board layout, position (4,1) is indeed Row 1, Column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,7): Row 7, Column 3\n\n- (1,2): Row 2, Column 1\n\n- (9,3): Row 3, Column 9\n\n- (1,1): Row 1, Column 1\n\n- (1,5): Row 5, Column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is Row 1, Column 8.\n\nOkay, so I need to plan my moves to collect apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple is closest to me. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,1) to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |1-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,1), with a distance of 3. The next closest is (1,2) at distance 4.\n\nI should consider going for (1,1) first since it's closer.\n\nNow, to get from (4,1) to (1,1), I need to move left three times:\n\n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in that path, as per the board layout.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check:\n\n- From (4,1), moving left to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied?\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1, Column 3 is empty.\n\n- Then to (2,1): Row 1, Column 2 is empty.\n\n- Finally to (1,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, it's safe to move left three times to get to (1,1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once. So, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,1), my body will extend, and I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern since I'm just starting.\n\nAlright, so my first move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's another apple at (1,2), which is directly above (1,1).\n\nAfter getting (1,1), I can consider moving up to (1,2) next, to collect that apple as well.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the next apple\n\nThat seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,1), I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (1,1), my tail will be at (2,1), assuming I move from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nSo, when I'm at (1,1), my body is:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous position at (2,1)\n\nThen, moving up to (1,2), which is the next apple.\n\nIs (1,2) clear? Looking at the board, it's an apple, so it's clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body will be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Previous head at (1,1)\n\n- Tail at (2,1)\n\nThen, I can consider moving to the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,7): distance from (1,2) is |1-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (9,3): |1-9| + |2-3| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (1,5): |1-1| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the closest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nFrom (1,2), to get to (1,5), I need to move up three times:\n\n(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nCurrently, enemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is far away. Assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on collecting apples efficiently is the priority.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n5. Move up to (1,3)\n\n6. Move up to (1,4)\n\n7. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,1), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and according to the last move information, I'm currently at (2,1). But looking at the board layout, it seems like I'm at (1,1). Wait, there might be a confusion here.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . .

I'm at (1,1).\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3. Apple at (1,1):\n\nI'm already here, so distance 0.\n\n4. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,8):\n\nDistance = |1-9| + |1-8| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\nSo, I'm already on top of an apple at (1,1). That's great!\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left to (1,1). Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move onto it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the rules a bit more.\n\nRule 1 says: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), moving to (1,1) would be staying in place, but according to the rules, that should be allowed, and I would eat the apple.\n\nBut in classic Snake, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that I need to move to a new spot to eat the apple.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm already on the apple, maybe I need to move away first and then come back to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating an apple extends my tail, so perhaps after eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't immediately run into it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to the apple and then plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (3,7), and (9,8).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), with body at (9,3).\n\nFirst, I should prioritize the closest apples to minimize the risk.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2), just above me at (1,1).\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2) to eat that apple.\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is already an apple, so maybe I should eat that first.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move onto the apple to eat it.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, moving to (1,1) would mean staying in place and eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, typically, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot.\n\nMaybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move to (1,1) from another position to eat it.\n\nBut according to the board, I'm already at (1,1).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating the apple requires moving to the position of the apple, and since I'm already there, I can eat it by staying in place.\n\nIn that case, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut then, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a dangerous position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, so if I move to (1,2), my tail will stay at (1,1), which is now empty.\n\nThen, I can move to (1,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nWait, but there's already an apple at (1,2), so maybe I should move there next.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nCurrent position: (1,1)\n\nApples: (3,7), (1,2), (1,1), (1,5), (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake: (9,4), body at (9,3)\n\nFirst, I need to eat the apple at (1,1). To do that, I move to (1,1), which is where I already am, so perhaps I can stay in place and eat it.\n\nBut in Snake, usually, you can't stay in place. Maybe in this game, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAssuming that, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nThen, for the next move, I need to move to a new spot to avoid hitting myself.\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), where there's another apple.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my tail.\n\nContinuing upwards to (1,3), but there's no apple there, and I need to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can consider moving right or left, depending on the board.\n\nBut looking at the board, moving up from (1,2) to (1,3) seems safe.\n\nWait, but there are no apples at (1,3). Maybe I should consider moving to (1,5) next.\n\nBut moving from (1,2) to (1,5) would require passing through (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1: . 2 T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . T\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (1,2), moving up to (1,3), then (1,4), then (1,5).\n\nAt (1,5), there's an apple.\n\nI need to ensure that moving up to (1,5) is safe.\n\nBut first, I need to make sure that there are no other snakes in my way.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), body at (9,3).\n\nThat's in the top-right corner, so it shouldn't interfere with my path upwards along column 1.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my own body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,1) and (1,2), my body will extend, so I need to keep track of my tail.\n\nBut for"

There are apples at (3,7), (1,2), (9,3), (1,1), and (1,5). Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,1) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . A . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: .

Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 3.\n\nNext is (1,1), distance 4.\n\nThen, (3,7), (9,3), and (1,5), all at distance 6.\n\nBut wait, apple at (1,2) is at Row 2, Column 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nFirst, check if I can move left towards (3,2). Is that safe?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,2) is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Row 2, Column 1, which is two steps to the left from my current position.\n\nBut immediately to my left is (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBut if I move left to (3,2), then next I can move left again to (2,2), then (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,1). It's quite far away, and it doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I should keep an eye on it in case it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor now, since it's far, I'll focus on getting the closest apple at (1,2).\n\nSo, my plan is to move left towards (3,2), then continue left to (2,2), then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or myself in those positions.\n\nWait, my snake is currently at (4,2), and I'm assuming it's just the head, since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,2) should be safe.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't hit myself if I make a wrong turn later.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (1,2), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (1,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Column 1, Row 2.\n\nI'm at Column 4, Row 2.\n\nSo, to get from (4,2) to (1,2), I need to move left three times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,2) and (1,2), there are positions (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): safe\n\n- Left to (2,2): safe\n\n- Left to (1,2): apple\n\nSo, I can safely move left three times to get to the apple at (1,2).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once.\n\nSo, I should move left towards (3,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, move left again to (2,2), and then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nAlso, since I'm just starting, my body is only the head, so I won't run into myself.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider if there are any better options.\n\nIs there another apple that's closer or easier to get?\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (1,1): distance 4\n\n- (1,5): distance 6\n\n- (3,7): distance 6\n\n- (9,3): distance 6\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is the closest, so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAlso, moving towards (1,2) might position me well to go for (1,1) next, which is nearby.\n\nAfter getting (1,2), I can consider moving down to (1,1) to get another apple.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nMove left to (3,2)\n\nThen left to (2,2)\n\nThen left to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,2).\n\nThen, to get (1,1), I can move down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nAt that point, my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nSo, moving down to (1,1) is safe.\n\nThen, after eating (1,1), my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nNext, I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest might be (3,7), but that's distance 6 from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's (9,3), which is also distance 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a better path.\n\nWait, after getting (1,2) and (1,1), I'm at (1,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (1,5) is distance 4.\n\nWhile (3,7) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (1,1) to (1,5):\n\n|1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nTo (3,7): |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (9,3): |1-9| + |1-3| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest next apple from (1,1).\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,1).

Wait, but in the board layout, Row 2 shows (2,4) as my position, but according to the coordinates, it should be (4,1). There seems to be a confusion here.\n\nWait, let's clarify the coordinates. The board is listed with Row 9 at the top and Row 0 at the bottom, with columns 0 to 9 from left to right. So, position (x,y) means column x, row y.\n\nIn the board layout, position (4,1) is indeed Row 1, Column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,7): Row 7, Column 3\n\n- (1,2): Row 2, Column 1\n\n- (9,3): Row 3, Column 9\n\n- (1,1): Row 1, Column 1\n\n- (1,5): Row 5, Column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is Row 1, Column 8.\n\nOkay, so I need to plan my moves to collect apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple is closest to me. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,1) to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |1-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,1), with a distance of 3. The next closest is (1,2) at distance 4.\n\nI should consider going for (1,1) first since it's closer.\n\nNow, to get from (4,1) to (1,1), I need to move left three times:\n\n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in that path, as per the board layout.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check:\n\n- From (4,1), moving left to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied?\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1, Column 3 is empty.\n\n- Then to (2,1): Row 1, Column 2 is empty.\n\n- Finally to (1,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, it's safe to move left three times to get to (1,1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once. So, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,1), my body will extend, and I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern since I'm just starting.\n\nAlright, so my first move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's another apple at (1,2), which is directly above (1,1).\n\nAfter getting (1,1), I can consider moving up to (1,2) next, to collect that apple as well.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the next apple\n\nThat seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,1), I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (1,1), my tail will be at (2,1), assuming I move from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nSo, when I'm at (1,1), my body is:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous position at (2,1)\n\nThen, moving up to (1,2), which is the next apple.\n\nIs (1,2) clear? Looking at the board, it's an apple, so it's clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body will be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Previous head at (1,1)\n\n- Tail at (2,1)\n\nThen, I can consider moving to the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,7): distance from (1,2) is |1-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (9,3): |1-9| + |2-3| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (1,5): |1-1| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the closest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nFrom (1,2), to get to (1,5), I need to move up three times:\n\n(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nCurrently, enemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is far away. Assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on collecting apples efficiently is the priority.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n5. Move up to (1,3)\n\n6. Move up to (1,4)\n\n7. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,1), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

I'm at (1,1).\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3.

Apple at (9,8):\n\nDistance = |1-9| + |1-8| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\nSo, I'm already on top of an apple at (1,1). That's great!\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left to (1,1). Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move onto it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the rules a bit more.\n\nRule 1 says: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), moving to (1,1) would be staying in place, but according to the rules, that should be allowed, and I would eat the apple.\n\nBut in classic Snake, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that I need to move to a new spot to eat the apple.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm already on the apple, maybe I need to move away first and then come back to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating an apple extends my tail, so perhaps after eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't immediately run into it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to the apple and then plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (3,7), and (9,8).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), with body at (9,3).\n\nFirst, I should prioritize the closest apples to minimize the risk.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2), just above me at (1,1).\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2) to eat that apple.\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is already an apple, so maybe I should eat that first.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move onto the apple to eat it.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, moving to (1,1) would mean staying in place and eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, typically, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot.\n\nMaybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move to (1,1) from another position to eat it.\n\nBut according to the board, I'm already at (1,1).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating the apple requires moving to the position of the apple, and since I'm already there, I can eat it by staying in place.\n\nIn that case, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut then, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a dangerous position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, so if I move to (1,2), my tail will stay at (1,1), which is now empty.\n\nThen, I can move to (1,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nWait, but there's already an apple at (1,2), so maybe I should move there next.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nCurrent position: (1,1)\n\nApples: (3,7), (1,2), (1,1), (1,5), (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake: (9,4), body at (9,3)\n\nFirst, I need to eat the apple at (1,1). To do that, I move to (1,1), which is where I already am, so perhaps I can stay in place and eat it.\n\nBut in Snake, usually, you can't stay in place. Maybe in this game, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAssuming that, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nThen, for the next move, I need to move to a new spot to avoid hitting myself.\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), where there's another apple.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my tail.\n\nContinuing upwards to (1,3), but there's no apple there, and I need to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can consider moving right or left, depending on the board.\n\nBut looking at the board, moving up from (1,2) to (1,3) seems safe.\n\nWait, but there are no apples at (1,3). Maybe I should consider moving to (1,5) next.\n\nBut moving from (1,2) to (1,5) would require passing through (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1: . 2 T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

Let's see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and according to the last move information, I'm currently at (2,1). But looking at the board layout, it seems like I'm at (1,1). Wait, there might be a confusion here.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . A (Apple at 9,8)\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . . (Apple at 3,7)\n\nRow 6: . . A . . . . . . . (Apple at 2,6)\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .

(My snake at 1,1)\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, I'm at (1,1), not (2,1). Got it.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,4), with its body at (9,3).\n\nOkay, so I need to plan my moves to collect apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, let's see which apples are closest to me. I'm at (1,1).\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3. Apple at (1,1):\n\nI'm already here, so distance 0.\n\n4. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,8):\n\nDistance = |1-9| + |1-8| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\nSo, I'm already on top of an apple at (1,1). That's great!\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left to (1,1). Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that I need to move to a new spot to eat the apple.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm already on the apple, maybe I need to move away first and then come back to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating an apple extends my tail, so perhaps after eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't immediately run into it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to the apple and then plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (3,7), and (9,8).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), with body at (9,3).\n\nFirst, I should prioritize the closest apples to minimize the risk.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2), just above me at (1,1).\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2) to eat that apple.\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is already an apple, so maybe I should eat that first.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move onto the apple to eat it.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, moving to (1,1) would mean staying in place and eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, typically, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot.\n\nMaybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move to (1,1) from another position to eat it.\n\nBut according to the board, I'm already at (1,1).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating the apple requires moving to the position of the apple, and since I'm already there, I can eat it by staying in place.\n\nIn that case, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut then, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a dangerous position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, so if I move to (1,2), my tail will stay at (1,1), which is now empty.\n\nThen, I can move to (1,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nWait, but there's already an apple at (1,2), so maybe I should move there next.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nCurrent position: (1,1)\n\nApples: (3,7), (1,2), (1,1), (1,5), (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake: (9,4), body at (9,3)\n\nFirst, I need to eat the apple at (1,1). To do that, I move to (1,1), which is where I already am, so perhaps I can stay in place and eat it.\n\nBut in Snake, usually, you can't stay in place. Maybe in this game, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAssuming that, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nThen, for the next move, I need to move to a new spot to avoid hitting myself.\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), where there's another apple.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my tail.\n\nContinuing upwards to (1,3), but there's no apple there, and I need to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can consider moving right or left, depending on the board.\n\nBut looking at the board, moving up from (1,2) to (1,3) seems safe.\n\nWait, but there are no apples at (1,3). Maybe I should consider moving to (1,5) next.\n\nBut moving from (1,2) to (1,5) would require passing through (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1: . 2 T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . T\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (1,2), moving up to (1,3), then (1,4), then (1,5).\n\nAt (1,5), there's an apple.\n\nI need to ensure that moving up to (1,5) is safe.\n\nBut first, I need to make sure that there are no other snakes in my way.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), body at (9,3).\n\nThat's in the top-right corner, so it shouldn't interfere with my path upwards along column 1.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my own body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,1) and (1,2), my body will extend, so I need to keep track of my tail.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that moving up to (1,5) is safe.\n\nOnce I reach (1,5), I can look for the next apple.\n\nAfter (1,5), the next closest apple is at (3,7), which is a bit further.\n\nI need to plan a path from (1,5) to (3,7).\n\nFrom (1,5), moving right to (2,5), then up to (2,6), where there's an apple.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (2,6).

There are apples at (3,7), (1,2), (9,3), (1,1), and (1,5). Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,1) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . A . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: .

Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 3.\n\nNext is (1,1), distance 4.\n\nThen, (3,7), (9,3), and (1,5), all at distance 6.\n\nBut wait, apple at (1,2) is at Row 2, Column 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nFirst, check if I can move left towards (3,2). Is that safe?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,2) is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Row 2, Column 1, which is two steps to the left from my current position.\n\nBut immediately to my left is (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBut if I move left to (3,2), then next I can move left again to (2,2), then (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,1). It's quite far away, and it doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I should keep an eye on it in case it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor now, since it's far, I'll focus on getting the closest apple at (1,2).\n\nSo, my plan is to move left towards (3,2), then continue left to (2,2), then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or myself in those positions.\n\nWait, my snake is currently at (4,2), and I'm assuming it's just the head, since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,2) should be safe.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't hit myself if I make a wrong turn later.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (1,2), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (1,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Column 1, Row 2.\n\nI'm at Column 4, Row 2.\n\nSo, to get from (4,2) to (1,2), I need to move left three times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,2) and (1,2), there are positions (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): safe\n\n- Left to (2,2): safe\n\n- Left to (1,2): apple\n\nSo, I can safely move left three times to get to the apple at (1,2).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once.\n\nSo, I should move left towards (3,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, move left again to (2,2), and then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nAlso, since I'm just starting, my body is only the head, so I won't run into myself.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider if there are any better options.\n\nIs there another apple that's closer or easier to get?\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (1,1): distance 4\n\n- (1,5): distance 6\n\n- (3,7): distance 6\n\n- (9,3): distance 6\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is the closest, so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAlso, moving towards (1,2) might position me well to go for (1,1) next, which is nearby.\n\nAfter getting (1,2), I can consider moving down to (1,1) to get another apple.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nMove left to (3,2)\n\nThen left to (2,2)\n\nThen left to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,2).\n\nThen, to get (1,1), I can move down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nAt that point, my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nSo, moving down to (1,1) is safe.\n\nThen, after eating (1,1), my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nNext, I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest might be (3,7), but that's distance 6 from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's (9,3), which is also distance 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a better path.\n\nWait, after getting (1,2) and (1,1), I'm at (1,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (1,5) is distance 4.\n\nWhile (3,7) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (1,1) to (1,5):\n\n|1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nTo (3,7): |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (9,3): |1-9| + |1-3| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest next apple from (1,1).\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,1). Hmm, looking at the board layout:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

Wait, but in the board layout, Row 2 shows (2,4) as my position, but according to the coordinates, it should be (4,1). There seems to be a confusion here.\n\nWait, let's clarify the coordinates. The board is listed with Row 9 at the top and Row 0 at the bottom, with columns 0 to 9 from left to right. So, position (x,y) means column x, row y.\n\nIn the board layout, position (4,1) is indeed Row 1, Column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,7): Row 7, Column 3\n\n- (1,2): Row 2, Column 1\n\n- (9,3): Row 3, Column 9\n\n- (1,1): Row 1, Column 1\n\n- (1,5): Row 5, Column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is Row 1, Column 8.\n\nOkay, so I need to plan my moves to collect apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple is closest to me. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,1) to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |1-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,1), with a distance of 3. The next closest is (1,2) at distance 4.\n\nI should consider going for (1,1) first since it's closer.\n\nNow, to get from (4,1) to (1,1), I need to move left three times:\n\n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in that path, as per the board layout.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check:\n\n- From (4,1), moving left to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied?\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1, Column 3 is empty.\n\n- Then to (2,1): Row 1, Column 2 is empty.\n\n- Finally to (1,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, it's safe to move left three times to get to (1,1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once. So, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,1), my body will extend, and I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern since I'm just starting.\n\nAlright, so my first move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's another apple at (1,2), which is directly above (1,1).\n\nAfter getting (1,1), I can consider moving up to (1,2) next, to collect that apple as well.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the next apple\n\nThat seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,1), I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (1,1), my tail will be at (2,1), assuming I move from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nSo, when I'm at (1,1), my body is:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous position at (2,1)\n\nThen, moving up to (1,2), which is the next apple.\n\nIs (1,2) clear? Looking at the board, it's an apple, so it's clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body will be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Previous head at (1,1)\n\n- Tail at (2,1)\n\nThen, I can consider moving to the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,7): distance from (1,2) is |1-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (9,3): |1-9| + |2-3| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (1,5): |1-1| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the closest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nFrom (1,2), to get to (1,5), I need to move up three times:\n\n(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nCurrently, enemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is far away. Assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on collecting apples efficiently is the priority.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n5. Move up to (1,3)\n\n6. Move up to (1,4)\n\n7. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,1), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (3,1) to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |3-3| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |3-1| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |3-9| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |3-1| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n5.

I'm at (1,1).\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3.

Apple at (9,8):\n\nDistance = |1-9| + |1-8| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\nSo, I'm already on top of an apple at (1,1). That's great!\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left to (1,1). Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move onto it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the rules a bit more.\n\nRule 1 says: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), moving to (1,1) would be staying in place, but according to the rules, that should be allowed, and I would eat the apple.\n\nBut in classic Snake, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that I need to move to a new spot to eat the apple.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm already on the apple, maybe I need to move away first and then come back to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating an apple extends my tail, so perhaps after eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't immediately run into it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to the apple and then plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (3,7), and (9,8).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), with body at (9,3).\n\nFirst, I should prioritize the closest apples to minimize the risk.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2), just above me at (1,1).\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2) to eat that apple.\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is already an apple, so maybe I should eat that first.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move onto the apple to eat it.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, moving to (1,1) would mean staying in place and eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, typically, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot.\n\nMaybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move to (1,1) from another position to eat it.\n\nBut according to the board, I'm already at (1,1).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating the apple requires moving to the position of the apple, and since I'm already there, I can eat it by staying in place.\n\nIn that case, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut then, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a dangerous position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, so if I move to (1,2), my tail will stay at (1,1), which is now empty.\n\nThen, I can move to (1,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nWait, but there's already an apple at (1,2), so maybe I should move there next.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nCurrent position: (1,1)\n\nApples: (3,7), (1,2), (1,1), (1,5), (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake: (9,4), body at (9,3)\n\nFirst, I need to eat the apple at (1,1). To do that, I move to (1,1), which is where I already am, so perhaps I can stay in place and eat it.\n\nBut in Snake, usually, you can't stay in place. Maybe in this game, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAssuming that, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nThen, for the next move, I need to move to a new spot to avoid hitting myself.\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), where there's another apple.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my tail.\n\nContinuing upwards to (1,3), but there's no apple there, and I need to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can consider moving right or left, depending on the board.\n\nBut looking at the board, moving up from (1,2) to (1,3) seems safe.\n\nWait, but there are no apples at (1,3). Maybe I should consider moving to (1,5) next.\n\nBut moving from (1,2) to (1,5) would require passing through (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1: . 2 T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

I'm at (1,1).\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3.

Apple at (9,8):\n\nDistance = |1-9| + |1-8| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\nSo, I'm already on top of an apple at (1,1). That's great!\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left to (1,1). Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that I need to move to a new spot to eat the apple.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm already on the apple, maybe I need to move away first and then come back to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating an apple extends my tail, so perhaps after eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't immediately run into it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to the apple and then plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (3,7), and (9,8).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), with body at (9,3).\n\nFirst, I should prioritize the closest apples to minimize the risk.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2), just above me at (1,1).\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2) to eat that apple.\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is already an apple, so maybe I should eat that first.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move onto the apple to eat it.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, moving to (1,1) would mean staying in place and eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, typically, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot.\n\nMaybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move to (1,1) from another position to eat it.\n\nBut according to the board, I'm already at (1,1).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating the apple requires moving to the position of the apple, and since I'm already there, I can eat it by staying in place.\n\nIn that case, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut then, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a dangerous position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, so if I move to (1,2), my tail will stay at (1,1), which is now empty.\n\nThen, I can move to (1,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nWait, but there's already an apple at (1,2), so maybe I should move there next.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nCurrent position: (1,1)\n\nApples: (3,7), (1,2), (1,1), (1,5), (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake: (9,4), body at (9,3)\n\nFirst, I need to eat the apple at (1,1). To do that, I move to (1,1), which is where I already am, so perhaps I can stay in place and eat it.\n\nBut in Snake, usually, you can't stay in place. Maybe in this game, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAssuming that, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nThen, for the next move, I need to move to a new spot to avoid hitting myself.\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), where there's another apple.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my tail.\n\nContinuing upwards to (1,3), but there's no apple there, and I need to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can consider moving right or left, depending on the board.\n\nBut looking at the board, moving up from (1,2) to (1,3) seems safe.\n\nWait, but there are no apples at (1,3). Maybe I should consider moving to (1,5) next.\n\nBut moving from (1,2) to (1,5) would require passing through (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1: . 2 T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

There are apples at (3,7), (1,2), (9,3), (1,1), and (1,5). Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,1) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 3.\n\nNext is (1,1), distance 4.\n\nThen, (3,7), (9,3), and (1,5), all at distance 6.\n\nBut wait, apple at (1,2) is at Row 2, Column 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nFirst, check if I can move left towards (3,2). Is that safe?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,2) is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Row 2, Column 1, which is two steps to the left from my current position.\n\nBut immediately to my left is (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBut if I move left to (3,2), then next I can move left again to (2,2), then (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,1). It's quite far away, and it doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I should keep an eye on it in case it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor now, since it's far, I'll focus on getting the closest apple at (1,2).\n\nSo, my plan is to move left towards (3,2), then continue left to (2,2), then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or myself in those positions.\n\nWait, my snake is currently at (4,2), and I'm assuming it's just the head, since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,2) should be safe.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't hit myself if I make a wrong turn later.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (1,2), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (1,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Column 1, Row 2.\n\nI'm at Column 4, Row 2.\n\nSo, to get from (4,2) to (1,2), I need to move left three times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,2) and (1,2), there are positions (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): safe\n\n- Left to (2,2): safe\n\n- Left to (1,2): apple\n\nSo, I can safely move left three times to get to the apple at (1,2).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once.\n\nSo, I should move left towards (3,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, move left again to (2,2), and then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nAlso, since I'm just starting, my body is only the head, so I won't run into myself.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider if there are any better options.\n\nIs there another apple that's closer or easier to get?\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (1,1): distance 4\n\n- (1,5): distance 6\n\n- (3,7): distance 6\n\n- (9,3): distance 6\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is the closest, so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAlso, moving towards (1,2) might position me well to go for (1,1) next, which is nearby.\n\nAfter getting (1,2), I can consider moving down to (1,1) to get another apple.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nMove left to (3,2)\n\nThen left to (2,2)\n\nThen left to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,2).\n\nThen, to get (1,1), I can move down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nAt that point, my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nSo, moving down to (1,1) is safe.\n\nThen, after eating (1,1), my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nNext, I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest might be (3,7), but that's distance 6 from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's (9,3), which is also distance 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a better path.\n\nWait, after getting (1,2) and (1,1), I'm at (1,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (1,5) is distance 4.\n\nWhile (3,7) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (1,1) to (1,5):\n\n|1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nTo (3,7): |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (9,3): |1-9| + |1-3| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest next apple from (1,1).\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,1). Hmm, looking at the board layout:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at Row 1, Column 4, which is (4,1). Wait, but in the board layout, Row 2 shows (2,4) as my position, but according to the coordinates, it should be (4,1). There seems to be a confusion here.\n\nWait, let's clarify the coordinates. The board is listed with Row 9 at the top and Row 0 at the bottom, with columns 0 to 9 from left to right. So, position (x,y) means column x, row y.\n\nIn the board layout, position (4,1) is indeed Row 1, Column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,7): Row 7, Column 3\n\n- (1,2): Row 2, Column 1\n\n- (9,3): Row 3, Column 9\n\n- (1,1): Row 1, Column 1\n\n- (1,5): Row 5, Column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is Row 1, Column 8.\n\nOkay, so I need to plan my moves to collect apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple is closest to me. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,1) to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |1-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,1), with a distance of 3. The next closest is (1,2) at distance 4.\n\nI should consider going for (1,1) first since it's closer.\n\nNow, to get from (4,1) to (1,1), I need to move left three times:\n\n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in that path, as per the board layout.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check:\n\n- From (4,1), moving left to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied?\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1, Column 3 is empty.\n\n- Then to (2,1): Row 1, Column 2 is empty.\n\n- Finally to (1,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, it's safe to move left three times to get to (1,1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once. So, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,1), my body will extend, and I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern since I'm just starting.\n\nAlright, so my first move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's another apple at (1,2), which is directly above (1,1).\n\nAfter getting (1,1), I can consider moving up to (1,2) next, to collect that apple as well.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the next apple\n\nThat seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,1), I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (1,1), my tail will be at (2,1), assuming I move from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nSo, when I'm at (1,1), my body is:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous position at (2,1)\n\nThen, moving up to (1,2), which is the next apple.\n\nIs (1,2) clear? Looking at the board, it's an apple, so it's clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body will be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Previous head at (1,1)\n\n- Tail at (2,1)\n\nThen, I can consider moving to the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,7): distance from (1,2) is |1-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (9,3): |1-9| + |2-3| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (1,5): |1-1| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the closest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nFrom (1,2), to get to (1,5), I need to move up three times:\n\n(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nCurrently, enemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is far away. Assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on collecting apples efficiently is the priority.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n5. Move up to (1,3)\n\n6. Move up to (1,4)\n\n7. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,1), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

I'm at (1,1).\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3.

Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move onto it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the rules a bit more.\n\nRule 1 says: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), moving to (1,1) would be staying in place, but according to the rules, that should be allowed, and I would eat the apple.\n\nBut in classic Snake, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that I need to move to a new spot to eat the apple.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm already on the apple, maybe I need to move away first and then come back to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that eating an apple extends my tail, so perhaps after eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't immediately run into it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to the apple and then plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (3,7), and (9,8).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), with body at (9,3).\n\nFirst, I should prioritize the closest apples to minimize the risk.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2), just above me at (1,1).\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2) to eat that apple.\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is already an apple, so maybe I should eat that first.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move onto the apple to eat it.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, moving to (1,1) would mean staying in place and eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, typically, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot.\n\nMaybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move to (1,1) from another position to eat it.\n\nBut according to the board, I'm already at (1,1).\n\nThis is confusing.

Maybe I should consider moving to (1,5) next.\n\nBut moving from (1,2) to (1,5) would require passing through (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1: . 2 T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and according to the last move information, I'm currently at (2,1). But looking at the board layout, it seems like I'm at (1,1). Wait, there might be a confusion here.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . .

Got it.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,4), with its body at (9,3).\n\nOkay, so I need to plan my moves to collect apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, let's see which apples are closest to me. I'm at (1,1).\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3. Apple at (1,1):\n\nI'm already here, so distance 0.\n\n4. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,8):\n\nDistance = |1-9| + |1-8| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\nSo, I'm already on top of an apple at (1,1). That's great!\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left to (1,1). Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that eating an apple requires moving to the position of the apple, and since I'm already there, I can eat it by staying in place.\n\nIn that case, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut then, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a dangerous position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, so if I move to (1,2), my tail will stay at (1,1), which is now empty.\n\nThen, I can move to (1,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nWait, but there's already an apple at (1,2), so maybe I should move there next.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nCurrent position: (1,1)\n\nApples: (3,7), (1,2), (1,1), (1,5), (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake: (9,4), body at (9,3)\n\nFirst, I need to eat the apple at (1,1). To do that, I move to (1,1), which is where I already am, so perhaps I can stay in place and eat it.\n\nBut in Snake, usually, you can't stay in place. Maybe in this game, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAssuming that, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nThen, for the next move, I need to move to a new spot to avoid hitting myself.\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), where there's another apple.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my tail.\n\nContinuing upwards to (1,3), but there's no apple there, and I need to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can consider moving right or left, depending on the board.\n\nBut looking at the board, moving up from (1,2) to (1,3) seems safe.\n\nWait, but there are no apples at (1,3). Maybe I should consider moving to (1,5) next.\n\nBut moving from (1,2) to (1,5) would require passing through (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1: . 2 T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

There are apples at (3,7), (1,2), (9,3), (1,1), and (1,5). Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,1) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . A . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: .

Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 3.\n\nNext is (1,1), distance 4.\n\nThen, (3,7), (9,3), and (1,5), all at distance 6.\n\nBut wait, apple at (1,2) is at Row 2, Column 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2)\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1)\n\nFirst, check if I can move left towards (3,2). Is that safe?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,2) is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Row 2, Column 1, which is two steps to the left from my current position.\n\nBut immediately to my left is (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBut if I move left to (3,2), then next I can move left again to (2,2), then (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,1). It's quite far away, and it doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I should keep an eye on it in case it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor now, since it's far, I'll focus on getting the closest apple at (1,2).\n\nSo, my plan is to move left towards (3,2), then continue left to (2,2), then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or myself in those positions.\n\nWait, my snake is currently at (4,2), and I'm assuming it's just the head, since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,2) should be safe.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't hit myself if I make a wrong turn later.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (1,2), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (1,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), which is Column 1, Row 2.\n\nI'm at Column 4, Row 2.\n\nSo, to get from (4,2) to (1,2), I need to move left three times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,2) and (1,2), there are positions (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): safe\n\n- Left to (2,2): safe\n\n- Left to (1,2): apple\n\nSo, I can safely move left three times to get to the apple at (1,2).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once.\n\nSo, I should move left towards (3,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, move left again to (2,2), and then to (1,2) to get the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nAlso, since I'm just starting, my body is only the head, so I won't run into myself.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider if there are any better options.\n\nIs there another apple that's closer or easier to get?\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (1,1): distance 4\n\n- (1,5): distance 6\n\n- (3,7): distance 6\n\n- (9,3): distance 6\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is the closest, so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAlso, moving towards (1,2) might position me well to go for (1,1) next, which is nearby.\n\nAfter getting (1,2), I can consider moving down to (1,1) to get another apple.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nMove left to (3,2)\n\nThen left to (2,2)\n\nThen left to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,2).\n\nThen, to get (1,1), I can move down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nAt that point, my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nSo, moving down to (1,1) is safe.\n\nThen, after eating (1,1), my body would be:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous head at (1,2)\n\n- Tail at (2,2)\n\nNext, I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest might be (3,7), but that's distance 6 from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's (9,3), which is also distance 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a better path.\n\nWait, after getting (1,2) and (1,1), I'm at (1,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (1,5) is distance 4.\n\nWhile (3,7) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (1,1) to (1,5):\n\n|1-1| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nTo (3,7): |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (9,3): |1-9| + |1-3| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest next apple from (1,1).\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1"

A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at Row 1, Column 4, which is (4,1). Wait, but in the board layout, Row 2 shows (2,4) as my position, but according to the coordinates, it should be (4,1). There seems to be a confusion here.\n\nWait, let's clarify the coordinates. The board is listed with Row 9 at the top and Row 0 at the bottom, with columns 0 to 9 from left to right. So, position (x,y) means column x, row y.\n\nIn the board layout, position (4,1) is indeed Row 1, Column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,7): Row 7, Column 3\n\n- (1,2): Row 2, Column 1\n\n- (9,3): Row 3, Column 9\n\n- (1,1): Row 1, Column 1\n\n- (1,5): Row 5, Column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is Row 1, Column 8.\n\nOkay, so I need to plan my moves to collect apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple is closest to me. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,1) to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3. Apple at (9,3):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |1-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4. Apple at (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (1,5):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,1), with a distance of 3. The next closest is (1,2) at distance 4.\n\nI should consider going for (1,1) first since it's closer.\n\nNow, to get from (4,1) to (1,1), I need to move left three times:\n\n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in that path, as per the board layout.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check:\n\n- From (4,1), moving left to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied?\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1, Column 3 is empty.\n\n- Then to (2,1): Row 1, Column 2 is empty.\n\n- Finally to (1,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, it's safe to move left three times to get to (1,1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only move once. So, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,1), my body will extend, and I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern since I'm just starting.\n\nAlright, so my first move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's another apple at (1,2), which is directly above (1,1).\n\nAfter getting (1,1), I can consider moving up to (1,2) next, to collect that apple as well.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the next apple\n\nThat seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,1), I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (1,1), my tail will be at (2,1), assuming I move from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nSo, when I'm at (1,1), my body is:\n\n- Head at (1,1)\n\n- Previous position at (2,1)\n\nThen, moving up to (1,2), which is the next apple.\n\nIs (1,2) clear? Looking at the board, it's an apple, so it's clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body will be:\n\n- Head at (1,2)\n\n- Previous head at (1,1)\n\n- Tail at (2,1)\n\nThen, I can consider moving to the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,7): distance from (1,2) is |1-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (9,3): |1-9| + |2-3| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (1,5): |1-1| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the closest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nFrom (1,2), to get to (1,5), I need to move up three times:\n\n(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nCurrently, enemy snake 1 is at (8,1), which is far away. Assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on collecting apples efficiently is the priority.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (3,1)\n\n2. Move left to (2,1)\n\n3. Move left to (1,1) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n5. Move up to (1,3)\n\n6. Move up to (1,4)\n\n7. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for this turn, I just need to decide my next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a better option or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,1), it's currently far away, and I don't expect it to reach me in the next few moves.\n\nTherefore, focusing on collecting the closest apples is a good strategy.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm just starting, my body is short, so I don't need to worry much about running into myself.\n\nIn summary, my next move should be to the left, towards (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

I'm at (1,1).\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances:\n\n1. Apple at (3,7):\n\nDistance = |1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\nDistance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3.

Apple at (9,8):\n\nDistance = |1-9| + |1-8| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\nSo, I'm already on top of an apple at (1,1). That's great!\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left to (1,1). Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple there, if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe the apple is at (1,1), and I need to move onto it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the rules a bit more.\n\nRule 1 says: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), moving to (1,1) would be staying in place, but according to the rules, that should be allowed, and I would eat the apple.\n\nBut in classic Snake, you can't stay in place; you must move to a new spot. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that I need to move to a new spot to eat the apple.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm already on the apple, maybe I need to move away first and then come back to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing.

Hmm, but according to the board, I'm already at (1,1). Maybe I need to confirm my current position.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,1), and there's an apple at (1,1), if I move to (1,1), I stay in place and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut in Snake, you typically move to an empty space to eat an apple, not stay in place. Maybe in this variant, staying in place is allowed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that eating an apple requires moving to the position of the apple, and since I'm already there, I can eat it by staying in place.\n\nIn that case, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nBut then, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a dangerous position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), my tail will extend, so if I move to (1,2), my tail will stay at (1,1), which is now empty.\n\nThen, I can move to (1,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nWait, but there's already an apple at (1,2), so maybe I should move there next.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nCurrent position: (1,1)\n\nApples: (3,7), (1,2), (1,1), (1,5), (9,8)\n\nEnemy snake: (9,4), body at (9,3)\n\nFirst, I need to eat the apple at (1,1). To do that, I move to (1,1), which is where I already am, so perhaps I can stay in place and eat it.\n\nBut in Snake, usually, you can't stay in place. Maybe in this game, staying in place is allowed and counts as eating the apple.\n\nAssuming that, I'll stay at (1,1) and eat the apple, growing in length.\n\nThen, for the next move, I need to move to a new spot to avoid hitting myself.\n\nSo, from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), where there's another apple.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my tail.\n\nContinuing upwards to (1,3), but there's no apple there, and I need to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can consider moving right or left, depending on the board.\n\nBut looking at the board, moving up from (1,2) to (1,3) seems safe.\n\nWait, but there are no apples at (1,3). Maybe I should consider moving to (1,5) next.\n\nBut moving from (1,2) to (1,5) would require passing through (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, Row 1: . 2 T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

So, from (1,5), I can move right to (2,5), then up to (2,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating (2,6), I can continue to (3,6), then (3,7) to eat the apple at (3,7).\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path.\n\nOnce I have eaten the apples at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (2,6), and (3,7), I can look for the next apple at (9,8).\n\nBut that's quite far, and I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a shorter path to another apple.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFrom (3,7), the next closest apple is at (9,8), which is distance |3-9| + |7-8| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for other apples.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apple at (9,8) last.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a path that allows me to pick up more apples without venturing too far.\n\nBut for now, I'll stick with the initial plan.\n\nSo, the sequence would be:\n\n1. Stay at (1,1) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple.\n\n3. Move up to (1,3).\n\n4. Move up to (1,4).\n\n5. Move up to (1,5) to eat the apple.\n\n6. Move right to (2,5).\n\n7. Move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n8. Move right to (3,6).\n\n9. Move up to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\n10. Then decide on the"

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and according to the last move information, I'm currently at (2,1).
