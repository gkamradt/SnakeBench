Moving DOWN is safe and starts positioning me toward several apples\n\nStrategy:\nI should move DOWN because:\n1. It's safe - no obstacles or snakes\n2.

Instead, I'll focus on moving up towards the apple at (7, 5). This will allow me to gain a point and potentially put some distance between myself and the enemy snake.\n\nHowever, I'll need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements. If it starts to move closer, I may need to adjust my strategy to avoid a collision.\n\nFor this turn, my move is: UP.\n\nNext turn, I'll continue to focus on moving up towards the apple at (7, 5), while keeping a close watch on the enemy snake's position.
