The apple at (5, 6) looks promising since it's directly towards left and upward. However, I need to strategize effectively after this move. Moving down to explore further positions could be a potential next move to see other strategies as well.\n\nActually, moving down to (6, 1) will keep my options open. For the next turn, I might plan to move up again or consider left or right towards reaching for different apples on the upcoming turns.\n\nHence, my decided next move is: **DOWN**."
