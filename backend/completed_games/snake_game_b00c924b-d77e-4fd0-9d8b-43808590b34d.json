            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top. My position at (7,9) is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, other snakes, or myself. The goal is to have the most points by the end, which means eating as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . A . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . 1 . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nWith X increasing to the right and Y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (1,5): Column 1, Row 5\n\n- (4,5): Column 4, Row 5\n\n- (9,4): Column 9, Row 4\n\n- (7,3): Column 7, Row 3\n\n- (3,0): Column 3, Row 0\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is Column 2, Row 3.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n2. (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n4. (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n5. (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 6. The next closest are (4,5) and (9,4), both at 7. The farthest is (3,0) at 13.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,3). It's directly below me, so I can move down to reach it.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,3). That's moving down 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between Y=9 and Y=3 on X=7, there are no apples or snakes listed, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is on Y=3, but X=2, so not in my path. So, I can safely move down to (7,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I will have grown, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nAlright, so first move: DOWN.\n\nBut let's think about what's next after eating (7,3). Which apple should I go for next?\n\nAfter eating (7,3), I'll be at (7,3), and the apple at (7,3) will be removed, and a new one will appear, but since there are multiple apples, I think they stay until eaten.\n\nWait, no, in this game, there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one increases my score and grows me.\n\nSo, after eating (7,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0).\n\nMy position will be (7,3). Let's calculate distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is (9,4) at distance 3.\n\nSo, from (7,3), I can move to (9,4).\n\nLet's plot the path:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's 3 steps: right, right, up.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, at (8,3) and (9,3), there are no snakes or apples blocking the path.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0).\n\nFrom (9,4), let's calculate distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's 6 steps: left, left, left, left, left, up.\n\nAgain, I need to ensure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (9,4) and (4,5), there are no listed snakes or apples in the path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5) at distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nThat's 3 steps: left, left, left.\n\nAgain, check for obstacles. No snakes or apples in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), remaining apple is (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps: down, down, down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut that's 7 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0).\n\nWait, (3,0) is an apple,"

That seems like a good target.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (7,8) to (7,3). It's straightforward: just move down 5 steps. So, down to (7,7), then (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in my path, so it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path, but since I'm moving in a straight line, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nOnce I'm at (7,3), what's next? Let's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0)\n\nFrom (7,3), the distances to these apples are:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is at (9,4), distance 3.\n\nPath from (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nSeems straightforward. No obstacles in the way.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nClosest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nAgain, seems clear.

Looking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0) anyway.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the second path is better.\n\nBut, to make it efficient, perhaps I can combine movements to pick up multiple apples without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider picking up apples in a different order to minimize total movement.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- Current: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nI already planned a path to (7,3), then (9,4), then (4,5), then (1,5), then (3,0).\n\nLet me calculate the total Manhattan distance for this path:\n\n- (7,8) to (7,3): 5\n\n- (7,3) to (9,4): 3\n\n- (9,4) to (4,5): 6\n\n- (4,5) to (1,5): 3\n\n- (1,5) to (3,0): 7\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nIs there a way to reduce this total distance?\n\nLet's try a different order:\n\n1.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top. My position at (7,9) is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, other snakes, or myself. The goal is to have the most points by the end, which means eating as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . A . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . 1 . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nWith X increasing to the right and Y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (1,5): Column 1, Row 5\n\n- (4,5): Column 4, Row 5\n\n- (9,4): Column 9, Row 4\n\n- (7,3): Column 7, Row 3\n\n- (3,0): Column 3, Row 0\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is Column 2, Row 3.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n2. (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n4. (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n5. (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 6. The next closest are (4,5) and (9,4), both at 7. The farthest is (3,0) at 13.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,3). It's directly below me, so I can move down to reach it.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,3). That's moving down 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between Y=9 and Y=3 on X=7, there are no apples or snakes listed, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is on Y=3, but X=2, so not in my path. So, I can safely move down to (7,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I will have grown, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nAlright, so first move: DOWN.\n\nBut let's think about what's next after eating (7,3). Which apple should I go for next?\n\nAfter eating (7,3), I'll be at (7,3), and the apple at (7,3) will be removed, and a new one will appear, but since there are multiple apples, I think they stay until eaten.\n\nWait, no, in this game, there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one increases my score and grows me.\n\nSo, after eating (7,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0).\n\nMy position will be (7,3). Let's calculate distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is (9,4) at distance 3.\n\nSo, from (7,3), I can move to (9,4).\n\nLet's plot the path:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's 3 steps: right, right, up.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, at (8,3) and (9,3), there are no snakes or apples blocking the path.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0).\n\nFrom (9,4), let's calculate distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's 6 steps: left, left, left, left, left, up.\n\nAgain, I need to ensure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (9,4) and (4,5), there are no listed snakes or apples in the path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5) at distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nThat's 3 steps: left, left, left.\n\nAgain, check for obstacles. No snakes or apples in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), remaining apple is (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps: down, down, down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut that's 7 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0).\n\nWait, (3,0) is an apple,"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are towards the top. I'm currently at position (7,9), which is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). So, multiple apples to go for, which is interesting because I need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (4,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was up, and I was at (7,9). Wait, actually, looking back, my last move was up from (7,8) to (7,9). But I need to correct that: if I moved up from (7,8) to (7,9), but according to the board state, I'm at (7,9), but in the last move information, it says I was at (7,8) and moved up to (7,9). So, I need to make sure I have the current position right.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nSo, row 9, column 7 is where I am, which is (7,9). Okay, got it.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. Let's consider the possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boundaries. Since the board is 10x10, X ranges from 0 to 9, and Y ranges from 0 to 9. So, from (7,9), moving up would be to (7,10), which is off the board, so that's invalid, I can't move up.\n\nMoving down would be to (7,8), left to (6,9), and right to (8,9).\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

A . . . . . .\n\nColumns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo, from (7,9), moving down to (7,8), which is empty.\n\nMoving left to (6,9), which is empty.\n\nMoving right to (8,9), which is empty.\n\nSo, all three directions are possible.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. My goal is to pick up apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples. Which apple is closest to my current position?\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9):\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 6.\n\nLooking at that, it's directly below me, since X is the same, just Y decreases from 9 to 3.\n\nSo, the path would be straightforward: move down step by step until I reach Y=3.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, from (7,9) down to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . . A . .\n\nSo, from (7,9) down to (7,3), passing through:\n\n(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)\n\nLooking at row 5 (Y=5): . A . . A . . . . .\n\nSo, at X=1 and X=4 there are apples, but our path is at X=7, which is empty.\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nAt (9,4), but our path is at (7,4), which is empty.\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . . A . .\n\nAt (4,3) is the enemy snake, and (7,3) is an apple.\n\nSo, from (7,9) to (7,3), the path seems clear.\n\nOnce I reach (7,3), I'll eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAfter eating (7,3), the remaining apples are:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0)\n\nFrom (7,3), let's calculate distances to these:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is at (9,4), distance 3.\n\nPath from (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll grow again.\n\nThen, remaining apples are (1,5), (4,5), (3,0)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nClosest is (4,5), distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's a clear path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nStraightforward.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), only (3,0) remains.\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top. My position at (7,9) is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, other snakes, or myself. The goal is to have the most points by the end, which means eating as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . A . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . 1 . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nWith X increasing to the right and Y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (1,5): Column 1, Row 5\n\n- (4,5): Column 4, Row 5\n\n- (9,4): Column 9, Row 4\n\n- (7,3): Column 7, Row 3\n\n- (3,0): Column 3, Row 0\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is Column 2, Row 3.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n2. (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n4. (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n5. (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 6. The next closest are (4,5) and (9,4), both at 7. The farthest is (3,0) at 13.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,3). It's directly below me, so I can move down to reach it.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,3). That's moving down 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between Y=9 and Y=3 on X=7, there are no apples or snakes listed, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is on Y=3, but X=2, so not in my path. So, I can safely move down to (7,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I will have grown, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nAlright, so first move: DOWN.\n\nBut let's think about what's next after eating (7,3). Which apple should I go for next?\n\nAfter eating (7,3), I'll be at (7,3), and the apple at (7,3) will be removed, and a new one will appear, but since there are multiple apples, I think they stay until eaten.\n\nWait, no, in this game, there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one increases my score and grows me.\n\nSo, after eating (7,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0).\n\nMy position will be (7,3). Let's calculate distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is (9,4) at distance 3.\n\nSo, from (7,3), I can move to (9,4).\n\nLet's plot the path:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's 3 steps: right, right, up.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, at (8,3) and (9,3), there are no snakes or apples blocking the path.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0).\n\nFrom (9,4), let's calculate distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's 6 steps: left, left, left, left, left, up.\n\nAgain, I need to ensure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (9,4) and (4,5), there are no listed snakes or apples in the path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5) at distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nThat's 3 steps: left, left, left.\n\nAgain, check for obstacles. No snakes or apples in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), remaining apple is (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps: down, down, down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut that's 7 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0).\n\nWait, (3,0) is an apple,"

So, if I move down from there, I'll be at (7,7). But let's think bigger picture here.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. Looking at the distances from my current position:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |8-5| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |8-3| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |8-0| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 5. That seems like a good target.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (7,8) to (7,3). It's straightforward: just move down 5 steps. So, down to (7,7), then (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.

Looking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0) anyway.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the second path is better.\n\nBut, to make it efficient, perhaps I can combine movements to pick up multiple apples without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider picking up apples in a different order to minimize total movement.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- Current: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nI already planned a path to (7,3), then (9,4), then (4,5), then (1,5), then (3,0).\n\nLet me calculate the total Manhattan distance for this path:\n\n- (7,8) to (7,3): 5\n\n- (7,3) to (9,4): 3\n\n- (9,4) to (4,5): 6\n\n- (4,5) to (1,5): 3\n\n- (1,5) to (3,0): 7\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nIs there a way to reduce this total distance?\n\nLet's try a different order:\n\n1.

(1,5) -> (3,0): |1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nSame total.\n\nWhat if I go to (4,5) first?\n\n1. (7,8) -> (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2.

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are towards the top. I'm currently at position (7,9), which is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). So, multiple apples to go for, which is interesting because I need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (4,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was up, and I was at (7,9). Wait, actually, looking back, my last move was up from (7,8) to (7,9). But I need to correct that: if I moved up from (7,8) to (7,9), but according to the board state, I'm at (7,9), but in the last move information, it says I was at (7,8) and moved up to (7,9). So, I need to make sure I have the current position right.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nSo, row 9, column 7 is where I am, which is (7,9). Okay, got it.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. Let's consider the possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boundaries. Since the board is 10x10, X ranges from 0 to 9, and Y ranges from 0 to 9. So, from (7,9), moving up would be to (7,10), which is off the board, so that's invalid, I can't move up.\n\nMoving down would be to (7,8), left to (6,9), and right to (8,9).\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

A . . . . . .\n\nColumns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo, from (7,9), moving down to (7,8), which is empty.\n\nMoving left to (6,9), which is empty.\n\nMoving right to (8,9), which is empty.\n\nSo, all three directions are possible.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. My goal is to pick up apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples. Which apple is closest to my current position?\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9):\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 6.\n\nLooking at that, it's directly below me, since X is the same, just Y decreases from 9 to 3.\n\nSo, the path would be straightforward: move down step by step until I reach Y=3.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, from (7,9) down to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . . A . .\n\nSo, from (7,9) down to (7,3), passing through:\n\n(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)\n\nLooking at row 5 (Y=5): . A . . A . . . . .\n\nSo, at X=1 and X=4 there are apples, but our path is at X=7, which is empty.\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nAt (9,4), but our path is at (7,4), which is empty.\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . . A . .\n\nAt (4,3) is the enemy snake, and (7,3) is an apple.\n\nSo, from (7,9) to (7,3), the path seems clear.\n\nOnce I reach (7,3), I'll eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAfter eating (7,3), the remaining apples are:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0)\n\nFrom (7,3), let's calculate distances to these:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is at (9,4), distance 3.\n\nPath from (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll grow again.\n\nThen, remaining apples are (1,5), (4,5), (3,0)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nClosest is (4,5), distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's a clear path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nStraightforward.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), only (3,0) remains.\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I'm currently at position (8,9), according to the board state you provided. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm near the top-right corner.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). That's a lot of apples to go after.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (5,3), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was to the right, from (7,9) to (8,9). I need to decide what to do next.\n\nLet me think about my options. From (8,9), I can move up, down, left, or right.\n\nWait, but the Y-coordinate goes from 0 to 9, with higher Y being upwards. So, at Y=9, I can't move up anymore because there's no Y=10. So, moving up is invalid; it would hit the wall.\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n1. **Down** to (8,8):\n\n   - Looking at the board, row 8 is all dots (empty spaces), so it's safe.\n\n   - But I need to think about where this leads me. If I go down, what's my plan?\n\n2. **Left** to (7,9):\n\n   - Row 9, column 7 is empty, so it's safe.\n\n   - Going left might bring me closer to some apples.\n\n3. **Right** to (9,9):\n\n   - Row 9, column 9 is empty, so it's safe.\n\n   - Going right might also lead me to apples.\n\nI need to think about which direction gets me closest to the apples while avoiding the enemy and not running into myself.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (8,9).\n\nUsing Manhattan distance:\n\n- (1,5): |8-1| + |9-5| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\n- (4,5): |8-4| + |9-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (9,4): |8-9| + |9-4| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (7,3): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- (3,0): |8-3| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,4), with a distance of 6.\n\nLet me think about how to get there.\n\nFrom (8,9):\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Then down to (9,8)\n\n- Then down to (9,7)\n\n- Then down to (9,6)\n\n- Then down to (9,5)\n\n- Then down to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nSo, from (8,9) to (9,9) is empty.\n\nRows 8 to 4, column 9:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nSo, column 9 from row 9 to row 4 is all dots, except row 4 has an apple at (9,4).\n\nTherefore, the path from (8,9) to (9,4) is clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow in length by one, so I need to make sure that the next move after that doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, moving right to (9,9) seems like a good step towards the closest apple.\n\nWait, but looking back, the apple at (9,4) is directly to the right and then down.\n\nAlternatively, there's another apple at (7,3), which is also relatively close, with a distance of 7.\n\nBut (9,4) is closer, so maybe go for that first.\n\nLet me think about the enemy snake.\n\nIt's at (5,3), and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nBut for now, it's at (5,3), and I'm at (8,9), so it's quite a distance away.\n\nI need to consider its possible movements, but since it's just the head and I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's moving towards the nearest apple as well.\n\nBut for now, my priority is to get to (9,4).\n\nSo, from (8,9), moving right to (9,9) is safe.\n\nThen, I can continue down to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), and (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a plan.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going down first and then right, but moving right first seems more direct.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\n- Down to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's 5 moves down after moving right once.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend by one, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't immediately lead me into my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a straight line, and the board is empty in that column, it should be fine.\n\nSo, for now, moving right to (9,9) seems like a good first step.\n\nWait, but looking back at the board, row 9, column 9 is empty, and so are all the rows below in that column, except for the apple at (9,4).\n\nSo, yes, moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9) could be considered, but that would take me further away from the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nUnless there's a better path that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I go left to (7,9), then down to (7,8), and so on.\n\nBut that would be a longer path to any of the apples.\n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at a distance of 7, while (9,4) is 6.\n\nSo, (9,4) is still closer.\n\nTherefore, moving right seems preferable.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,8) could be considered, but that would require more moves to reach (9,4).\n\nSo, again, moving right is more direct.\n\nAlright, I think I've convinced myself that moving right to (9,9) is the best first step.\n\nI'll do that.\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"

There are apples at (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top. My position at (7,9) is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, other snakes, or myself. The goal is to have the most points by the end, which means eating as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . A . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . 1 . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nWith X increasing to the right and Y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (1,5): Column 1, Row 5\n\n- (4,5): Column 4, Row 5\n\n- (9,4): Column 9, Row 4\n\n- (7,3): Column 7, Row 3\n\n- (3,0): Column 3, Row 0\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is Column 2, Row 3.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n2. (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n4. (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n5. (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 6. The next closest are (4,5) and (9,4), both at 7. The farthest is (3,0) at 13.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,3). It's directly below me, so I can move down to reach it.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,3). That's moving down 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between Y=9 and Y=3 on X=7, there are no apples or snakes listed, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is on Y=3, but X=2, so not in my path. So, I can safely move down to (7,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I will have grown, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nAlright, so first move: DOWN.\n\nBut let's think about what's next after eating (7,3). Which apple should I go for next?\n\nAfter eating (7,3), I'll be at (7,3), and the apple at (7,3) will be removed, and a new one will appear, but since there are multiple apples, I think they stay until eaten.\n\nWait, no, in this game, there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one increases my score and grows me.\n\nSo, after eating (7,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0).\n\nMy position will be (7,3). Let's calculate distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is (9,4) at distance 3.\n\nSo, from (7,3), I can move to (9,4).\n\nLet's plot the path:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's 3 steps: right, right, up.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, at (8,3) and (9,3), there are no snakes or apples blocking the path.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0).\n\nFrom (9,4), let's calculate distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's 6 steps: left, left, left, left, left, up.\n\nAgain, I need to ensure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (9,4) and (4,5), there are no listed snakes or apples in the path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5) at distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nThat's 3 steps: left, left, left.\n\nAgain, check for obstacles. No snakes or apples in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), remaining apple is (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps: down, down, down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut that's 7 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0).\n\nWait, (3,0) is an apple,"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are towards the top. I'm currently at position (7,8), which is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). So, multiple apples to go for, which is interesting because I need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (3,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was down, and I was at (7,8). So, if I move down from there, I'll be at (7,7). But let's think bigger picture here.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. Looking at the distances from my current position:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |8-5| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |8-3| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |8-0| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 5. That seems like a good target.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (7,8) to (7,3). It's straightforward: just move down 5 steps. So, down to (7,7), then (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in my path, so it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path, but since I'm moving in a straight line, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nOnce I'm at (7,3), what's next?

Looking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0) anyway.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the second path is better.\n\nBut, to make it efficient, perhaps I can combine movements to pick up multiple apples without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider picking up apples in a different order to minimize total movement.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- Current: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nI already planned a path to (7,3), then (9,4), then (4,5), then (1,5), then (3,0).\n\nLet me calculate the total Manhattan distance for this path:\n\n- (7,8) to (7,3): 5\n\n- (7,3) to (9,4): 3\n\n- (9,4) to (4,5): 6\n\n- (4,5) to (1,5): 3\n\n- (1,5) to (3,0): 7\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nIs there a way to reduce this total distance?\n\nLet's try a different order:\n\n1.

Wait, actually, looking back, my last move was up from (7,8) to (7,9). But I need to correct that: if I moved up from (7,8) to (7,9), but according to the board state, I'm at (7,9), but in the last move information, it says I was at (7,8) and moved up to (7,9). So, I need to make sure I have the current position right.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nSo, row 9, column 7 is where I am, which is (7,9). Okay, got it.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. Let's consider the possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boundaries. Since the board is 10x10, X ranges from 0 to 9, and Y ranges from 0 to 9. So, from (7,9), moving up would be to (7,10), which is off the board, so that's invalid, I can't move up.\n\nMoving down would be to (7,8), left to (6,9), and right to (8,9).\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

Which apple is closest to my current position?\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9):\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 6.\n\nLooking at that, it's directly below me, since X is the same, just Y decreases from 9 to 3.\n\nSo, the path would be straightforward: move down step by step until I reach Y=3.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, from (7,9) down to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

A\n\nSo, column 9 from row 9 to row 4 is all dots, except row 4 has an apple at (9,4).\n\nTherefore, the path from (8,9) to (9,4) is clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow in length by one, so I need to make sure that the next move after that doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, moving right to (9,9) seems like a good step towards the closest apple.\n\nWait, but looking back, the apple at (9,4) is directly to the right and then down.\n\nAlternatively, there's another apple at (7,3), which is also relatively close, with a distance of 7.\n\nBut (9,4) is closer, so maybe go for that first.\n\nLet me think about the enemy snake.\n\nIt's at (5,3), and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nBut for now, it's at (5,3), and I'm at (8,9), so it's quite a distance away.\n\nI need to consider its possible movements, but since it's just the head and I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's moving towards the nearest apple as well.\n\nBut for now, my priority is to get to (9,4).\n\nSo, from (8,9), moving right to (9,9) is safe.\n\nThen, I can continue down to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), and (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a plan.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going down first and then right, but moving right first seems more direct.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\n- Down to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's 5 moves down after moving right once.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend by one, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't immediately lead me into my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a straight line, and the board is empty in that column, it should be fine.\n\nSo, for now, moving right to (9,9) seems like a good first step.\n\nWait, but looking back at the board, row 9, column 9 is empty, and so are all the rows below in that column, except for the apple at (9,4).\n\nSo, yes, moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9) could be considered, but that would take me further away from the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nUnless there's a better path that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I go left to (7,9), then down to (7,8), and so on.\n\nBut that would be a longer path to any of the apples.\n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at a distance of 7, while (9,4) is 6.\n\nSo, (9,4) is still closer.\n\nTherefore, moving right seems preferable.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,8) could be considered, but that would require more moves to reach (9,4).\n\nSo, again, moving right is more direct.\n\nAlright, I think I've convinced myself that moving right to (9,9) is the best first step.\n\nI'll do that.\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I'm currently at position (9,9), according to the board state you provided. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm near the top-right corner.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). That's a lot of apples to go after.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (6,3), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me think about my options.\n\nFirst, considering the boundaries:\n\n- At (9,9), moving up would be to (9,10), but since the board only goes up to Y=9, that would be out of bounds and I'd die.\n\n- So, I can't move up.\n\nThat leaves me with down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Down** to (9,8):\n\n   - Looking at the board, column 9 from row 9 down to row 0 seems to be open except for the apple at (9,4).\n\n   - So, moving down is safe for now, but I need to plan ahead to make sure I don't run into my own tail or the enemy.\n\n2. **Left** to (8,9):\n\n   - Row 9, moving left from (9,9) to (8,9). Looking at the board, it seems open.\n\n   - Again, I need to consider the long-term path.\n\n3. **Right** to (10,9):\n\n   - But X=10 is out of bounds, so I can't move right.\n\nWait, hold on. The board is 10x10, with X from 0 to 9 and Y from 0 to 9. So, moving right from (9,9) to (10,9) is out of bounds. I can't do that.\n\nSo, actually, I can't move right either.\n\nTherefore, my possible moves are only down or left.\n\nNow, I need to decide between moving down to (9,8) or left to (8,9).\n\nLet me think about which direction gets me closer to the apples while avoiding the enemy and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's list the distances to each apple from my current position (9,9), using Manhattan distance:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |9-5| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (9,4): |9-9| + |9-4| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |9-7| + |9-3| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |9-0| = 6 + 9 = 15\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,4), with a distance of 5.\n\nLet me think about how to get there.\n\nFrom (9,9), moving down to (9,8), then (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), and (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a direct path.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9, columns 9 to 0:\n\n  - Column 9: from Y=9 down to Y=4 is empty, except for the apple at (9,4).\n\n  - So, moving down to (9,4) is clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow in length, so I need to ensure that my path doesn't lead me into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, since I'm moving in a straight line and the column is empty, it should be safe.\n\nAdditionally, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (6,3). I don't want to get too close to it.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,8) seems safe, as it's away from the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,9):\n\n- From (8,9), I can continue moving left to (7,9), (6,9), etc.\n\n- But the closest apple is at (9,4), which is down.\n\n- So, moving left wouldn't be as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (9,8) seems like a better choice.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Move down to (9,8)\n\n- Then down to (9,7)\n\n- Then down to (9,6)\n\n- Then down to (9,5)\n\n- Then down to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a direct path to the closest apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll need to decide on the next target.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (9,4) seems like the way to go.\n\nSo, my next move should be down to (9,8).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down is safe.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nSo, at (9,9), which is the rightmost cell, moving down to (9,8) should be fine.\n\nNo obstacles there.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,9) is also safe, but as I thought earlier, it's not as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nHence, moving down to (9,8) is the better choice.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving down towards the closest apple at (9,4) is the most direct path.\n\n- Moving left would take me away from the closest apple.\n\n- Moving up or right is not possible due to board boundaries.\n\n- The path down is clear, and I can proceed without immediate risks from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Continue moving down towards the apple at (9,4).\n\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust path if necessary.\n\n- After eating the apple, assess the positions of remaining apples to determine the next target."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top. My position at (7,9) is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, other snakes, or myself. The goal is to have the most points by the end, which means eating as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . A . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . 1 . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nWith X increasing to the right and Y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (1,5): Column 1, Row 5\n\n- (4,5): Column 4, Row 5\n\n- (9,4): Column 9, Row 4\n\n- (7,3): Column 7, Row 3\n\n- (3,0): Column 3, Row 0\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is Column 2, Row 3.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n2. (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n4. (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n5. (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 6. The next closest are (4,5) and (9,4), both at 7. The farthest is (3,0) at 13.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,3). It's directly below me, so I can move down to reach it.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,3). That's moving down 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between Y=9 and Y=3 on X=7, there are no apples or snakes listed, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is on Y=3, but X=2, so not in my path. So, I can safely move down to (7,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I will have grown, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nAlright, so first move: DOWN.\n\nBut let's think about what's next after eating (7,3). Which apple should I go for next?\n\nAfter eating (7,3), I'll be at (7,3), and the apple at (7,3) will be removed, and a new one will appear, but since there are multiple apples, I think they stay until eaten.\n\nWait, no, in this game, there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one increases my score and grows me.\n\nSo, after eating (7,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0).\n\nMy position will be (7,3). Let's calculate distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is (9,4) at distance 3.\n\nSo, from (7,3), I can move to (9,4).\n\nLet's plot the path:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's 3 steps: right, right, up.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, at (8,3) and (9,3), there are no snakes or apples blocking the path.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0).\n\nFrom (9,4), let's calculate distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's 6 steps: left, left, left, left, left, up.\n\nAgain, I need to ensure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (9,4) and (4,5), there are no listed snakes or apples in the path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5) at distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nThat's 3 steps: left, left, left.\n\nAgain, check for obstacles. No snakes or apples in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), remaining apple is (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps: down, down, down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut that's 7 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0).\n\nWait, (3,0) is an apple,"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are towards the top. I'm currently at position (7,8), which is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). So, multiple apples to go for, which is interesting because I need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (3,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was down, and I was at (7,8). So, if I move down from there, I'll be at (7,7). But let's think bigger picture here.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. Looking at the distances from my current position:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |8-5| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |8-3| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |8-0| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 5. That seems like a good target.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (7,8) to (7,3). It's straightforward: just move down 5 steps. So, down to (7,7), then (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in my path, so it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path, but since I'm moving in a straight line, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nOnce I'm at (7,3), what's next? Let's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0)\n\nFrom (7,3), the distances to these apples are:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is at (9,4), distance 3.\n\nPath from (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nSeems straightforward. No obstacles in the way.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nClosest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nAgain, seems clear. No obstacles.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nStraightforward.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), only (3,0) remains.\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps down and 2 steps right, totaling 8 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps, matching the Manhattan distance.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles. Looking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0) anyway.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the second path is better.\n\nBut, to make it efficient, perhaps I can combine movements to pick up multiple apples without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider picking up apples in a different order to minimize total movement.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- Current: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nI already planned a path to (7,3), then (9,4), then (4,5), then (1,5), then (3,0).\n\nLet me calculate the total Manhattan distance for this path:\n\n- (7,8) to (7,3): 5\n\n- (7,3) to (9,4): 3\n\n- (9,4) to (4,5): 6\n\n- (4,5) to (1,5): 3\n\n- (1,5) to (3,0): 7\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nIs there a way to reduce this total distance?\n\nLet's try a different order:\n\n1. (7,8) -> (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n2. (9,4) -> (7,3): |9-7| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n3. (7,3) -> (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n4. (4,5) -> (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. (1,5) -> (3,0): |1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nSame total.\n\nWhat if I go to (4,5) first?\n\n1. (7,8) -> (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. (4,5) -> (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. (1,5) -> (7,3): |1-7| + |5-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n4. (7,3) -> (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5. (9,4) -> (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 +"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are towards the top. I'm currently at position (7,9), which is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). So, multiple apples to go for, which is interesting because I need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (4,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was up, and I was at (7,9). Wait, actually, looking back, my last move was up from (7,8) to (7,9). But I need to correct that: if I moved up from (7,8) to (7,9), but according to the board state, I'm at (7,9), but in the last move information, it says I was at (7,8) and moved up to (7,9). So, I need to make sure I have the current position right.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nSo, row 9, column 7 is where I am, which is (7,9). Okay, got it.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. Let's consider the possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boundaries. Since the board is 10x10, X ranges from 0 to 9, and Y ranges from 0 to 9. So, from (7,9), moving up would be to (7,10), which is off the board, so that's invalid, I can't move up.\n\nMoving down would be to (7,8), left to (6,9), and right to (8,9).\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

A . . . . . .\n\nColumns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo, from (7,9), moving down to (7,8), which is empty.\n\nMoving left to (6,9), which is empty.\n\nMoving right to (8,9), which is empty.\n\nSo, all three directions are possible.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. My goal is to pick up apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples. Which apple is closest to my current position?\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9):\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 6.\n\nLooking at that, it's directly below me, since X is the same, just Y decreases from 9 to 3.\n\nSo, the path would be straightforward: move down step by step until I reach Y=3.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, from (7,9) down to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . . A . .\n\nSo, from (7,9) down to (7,3), passing through:\n\n(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)\n\nLooking at row 5 (Y=5): . A . . A . . . . .\n\nSo, at X=1 and X=4 there are apples, but our path is at X=7, which is empty.\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . .

A . .\n\nAt (4,3) is the enemy snake, and (7,3) is an apple.\n\nSo, from (7,9) to (7,3), the path seems clear.\n\nOnce I reach (7,3), I'll eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAfter eating (7,3), the remaining apples are:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0)\n\nFrom (7,3), let's calculate distances to these:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is at (9,4), distance 3.\n\nPath from (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll grow again.\n\nThen, remaining apples are (1,5), (4,5), (3,0)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nClosest is (4,5), distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's a clear path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nStraightforward.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), only (3,0) remains.\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's"

So, at Y=9, I can't move up anymore because there's no Y=10. So, moving up is invalid; it would hit the wall.\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n1. **Down** to (8,8):\n\n   - Looking at the board, row 8 is all dots (empty spaces), so it's safe.\n\n   - But I need to think about where this leads me.

So, I'm near the top-right corner.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). That's a lot of apples to go after.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (6,3), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me think about my options.\n\nFirst, considering the boundaries:\n\n- At (9,9), moving up would be to (9,10), but since the board only goes up to Y=9, that would be out of bounds and I'd die.\n\n- So, I can't move up.\n\nThat leaves me with down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Down** to (9,8):\n\n   - Looking at the board, column 9 from row 9 down to row 0 seems to be open except for the apple at (9,4).\n\n   - So, moving down is safe for now, but I need to plan ahead to make sure I don't run into my own tail or the enemy.\n\n2. **Left** to (8,9):\n\n   - Row 9, moving left from (9,9) to (8,9).

I don't want to get too close to it.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,8) seems safe, as it's away from the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,9):\n\n- From (8,9), I can continue moving left to (7,9), (6,9), etc.\n\n- But the closest apple is at (9,4), which is down.\n\n- So, moving left wouldn't be as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (9,8) seems like a better choice.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Move down to (9,8)\n\n- Then down to (9,7)\n\n- Then down to (9,6)\n\n- Then down to (9,5)\n\n- Then down to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a direct path to the closest apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll need to decide on the next target.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (9,4) seems like the way to go.\n\nSo, my next move should be down to (9,8).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down is safe.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nSo, at (9,9), which is the rightmost cell, moving down to (9,8) should be fine.\n\nNo obstacles there.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,9) is also safe, but as I thought earlier, it's not as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nHence, moving down to (9,8) is the better choice.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving down towards the closest apple at (9,4) is the most direct path.\n\n- Moving left would take me away from the closest apple.\n\n- Moving up or right is not possible due to board boundaries.\n\n- The path down is clear, and I can proceed without immediate risks from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Continue moving down towards the apple at (9,4).\n\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust path if necessary.\n\n- After eating the apple, assess the positions of remaining apples to determine the next target."

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on my next move in this Snake game. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I'm currently at position (9,8), according to the board state you provided. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm near the top-right corner.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0), and (4,3). That's a lot of apples to go after.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (7,3) with a body at (6,3). So, I need to be careful around that area.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me think about my options.\n\nFirst, considering the boundaries:\n\n- At (9,8), moving up would be to (9,9), but there's nothing there, so it's safe.\n\n- Moving down would be to (9,7), which also seems safe.\n\n- Moving left would be to (8,8), which is also fine.\n\n- Moving right would be to (10,8), but X=10 is out of bounds, so I can't do that.\n\nSo, my possible moves are up, down, or left.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. I should consider which direction gets me closer to an apple while avoiding the enemy and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's look at the distances to each apple from my current position (9,8), using Manhattan distance:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |8-5| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |8-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (9,4): |9-9| + |8-4| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |8-0| = 6 + 8 = 14\n\n- (4,3): |9-4| + |8-3| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,4), with a distance of 4.\n\nLet me think about how to get there.\n\nFrom (9,8), moving down to (9,7), then (9,6), then (9,5), and finally (9,4) to eat the apple. That seems like a direct path.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: from Y=8 down to Y=4, it seems open except for the apple at (9,4).\n\n- So, moving down to (9,4) should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow in length, so I need to ensure that my path doesn't lead me into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, since I'm moving in a straight line and the column is empty, it should be fine.\n\nAdditionally, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (7,3) with a body at (6,3). It's in row 3, column 7 and 6.\n\nSo, it's quite a bit below my current position. As long as I don't move down too far, I should be okay.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,7) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,9):\n\n- There's nothing there, so it's safe.\n\n- But moving up wouldn't get me closer to the apple at (9,4).\n\n- So, it's not the most efficient move.\n\nMoving left to (8,8):\n\n- That would take me away from the closest apple.\n\n- Unless there's a strategic reason, it's not the best choice.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (9,7) seems like the best option.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Move down to (9,7)\n\n- Then down to (9,6)\n\n- Then down to (9,5)\n\n- Then down to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a direct path to the closest apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll need to decide on the next target.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (9,4) is the way to go.\n\nSo, my next move should be down to (9,7).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down is safe.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nSo, at (9,8), moving down to (9,7) should be fine.\n\nNo obstacles there.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving up or left is possible, but not as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nHence, moving down to (9,7) is the better choice.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving down towards the closest apple at (9,4) is the most direct path.\n\n- Moving up or left would take me away from the closest apple.\n\n- Moving right is not possible due to board boundaries.\n\n- The path down is clear, and I can proceed without immediate risks from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Continue moving down towards the apple at (9,4).\n\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust path if necessary.\n\n- After eating the apple, assess the positions of remaining apples to determine the next target.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top. My position at (7,9) is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, other snakes, or myself. The goal is to have the most points by the end, which means eating as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . A . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . 1 . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nWith X increasing to the right and Y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (1,5): Column 1, Row 5\n\n- (4,5): Column 4, Row 5\n\n- (9,4): Column 9, Row 4\n\n- (7,3): Column 7, Row 3\n\n- (3,0): Column 3, Row 0\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is Column 2, Row 3.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n2. (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n4. (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n5. (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 6. The next closest are (4,5) and (9,4), both at 7. The farthest is (3,0) at 13.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,3). It's directly below me, so I can move down to reach it.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,3). That's moving down 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between Y=9 and Y=3 on X=7, there are no apples or snakes listed, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is on Y=3, but X=2, so not in my path. So, I can safely move down to (7,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I will have grown, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nAlright, so first move: DOWN.\n\nBut let's think about what's next after eating (7,3). Which apple should I go for next?\n\nAfter eating (7,3), I'll be at (7,3), and the apple at (7,3) will be removed, and a new one will appear, but since there are multiple apples, I think they stay until eaten.\n\nWait, no, in this game, there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one increases my score and grows me.\n\nSo, after eating (7,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0).\n\nMy position will be (7,3). Let's calculate distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is (9,4) at distance 3.\n\nSo, from (7,3), I can move to (9,4).\n\nLet's plot the path:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's 3 steps: right, right, up.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, at (8,3) and (9,3), there are no snakes or apples blocking the path.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0).\n\nFrom (9,4), let's calculate distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's 6 steps: left, left, left, left, left, up.\n\nAgain, I need to ensure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (9,4) and (4,5), there are no listed snakes or apples in the path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5) at distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nThat's 3 steps: left, left, left.\n\nAgain, check for obstacles. No snakes or apples in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), remaining apple is (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps: down, down, down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut that's 7 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0).\n\nWait, (3,0) is an apple,"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are towards the top. I'm currently at position (7,8), which is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). So, multiple apples to go for, which is interesting because I need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (3,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was down, and I was at (7,8). So, if I move down from there, I'll be at (7,7). But let's think bigger picture here.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. Looking at the distances from my current position:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |8-5| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |8-3| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |8-0| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 5. That seems like a good target.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (7,8) to (7,3). It's straightforward: just move down 5 steps. So, down to (7,7), then (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in my path, so it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path, but since I'm moving in a straight line, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nOnce I'm at (7,3), what's next? Let's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0)\n\nFrom (7,3), the distances to these apples are:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is at (9,4), distance 3.\n\nPath from (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nSeems straightforward. No obstacles in the way.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nClosest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nAgain, seems clear. No obstacles.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nStraightforward.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), only (3,0) remains.\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps down and 2 steps right, totaling 8 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps, matching the Manhattan distance.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles. Looking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0) anyway.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the second path is better.\n\nBut, to make it efficient, perhaps I can combine movements to pick up multiple apples without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider picking up apples in a different order to minimize total movement.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- Current: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nI already planned a path to (7,3), then (9,4), then (4,5), then (1,5), then (3,0).\n\nLet me calculate the total Manhattan distance for this path:\n\n- (7,8) to (7,3): 5\n\n- (7,3) to (9,4): 3\n\n- (9,4) to (4,5): 6\n\n- (4,5) to (1,5): 3\n\n- (1,5) to (3,0): 7\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nIs there a way to reduce this total distance?\n\nLet's try a different order:\n\n1. (7,8) -> (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n2. (9,4) -> (7,3): |9-7| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n3. (7,3) -> (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n4. (4,5) -> (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. (1,5) -> (3,0): |1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nSame total.\n\nWhat if I go to (4,5) first?\n\n1. (7,8) -> (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. (4,5) -> (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. (1,5) -> (7,3): |1-7| + |5-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n4. (7,3) -> (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5. (9,4) -> (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 +"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are towards the top. I'm currently at position (7,9), which is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). So, multiple apples to go for, which is interesting because I need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (4,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was up, and I was at (7,9). Wait, actually, looking back, my last move was up from (7,8) to (7,9). But I need to correct that: if I moved up from (7,8) to (7,9), but according to the board state, I'm at (7,9), but in the last move information, it says I was at (7,8) and moved up to (7,9). So, I need to make sure I have the current position right.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nSo, row 9, column 7 is where I am, which is (7,9). Okay, got it.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. Let's consider the possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boundaries. Since the board is 10x10, X ranges from 0 to 9, and Y ranges from 0 to 9. So, from (7,9), moving up would be to (7,10), which is off the board, so that's invalid, I can't move up.\n\nMoving down would be to (7,8), left to (6,9), and right to (8,9).\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

A . . . . . .\n\nColumns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo, from (7,9), moving down to (7,8), which is empty.\n\nMoving left to (6,9), which is empty.\n\nMoving right to (8,9), which is empty.\n\nSo, all three directions are possible.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. My goal is to pick up apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples. Which apple is closest to my current position?\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9):\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 6.\n\nLooking at that, it's directly below me, since X is the same, just Y decreases from 9 to 3.\n\nSo, the path would be straightforward: move down step by step until I reach Y=3.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, from (7,9) down to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . . A . .\n\nSo, from (7,9) down to (7,3), passing through:\n\n(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)\n\nLooking at row 5 (Y=5): . A . . A . . . . .\n\nSo, at X=1 and X=4 there are apples, but our path is at X=7, which is empty.\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nAt (9,4), but our path is at (7,4), which is empty.\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . . A . .\n\nAt (4,3) is the enemy snake, and (7,3) is an apple.\n\nSo, from (7,9) to (7,3), the path seems clear.\n\nOnce I reach (7,3), I'll eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAfter eating (7,3), the remaining apples are:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0)\n\nFrom (7,3), let's calculate distances to these:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is at (9,4), distance 3.\n\nPath from (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll grow again.\n\nThen, remaining apples are (1,5), (4,5), (3,0)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nClosest is (4,5), distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's a clear path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nStraightforward.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), only (3,0) remains.\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's"

So, at Y=9, I can't move up anymore because there's no Y=10. So, moving up is invalid; it would hit the wall.\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n1. **Down** to (8,8):\n\n   - Looking at the board, row 8 is all dots (empty spaces), so it's safe.\n\n   - But I need to think about where this leads me.

So, I'm near the top-right corner.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). That's a lot of apples to go after.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (6,3), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me think about my options.\n\nFirst, considering the boundaries:\n\n- At (9,9), moving up would be to (9,10), but since the board only goes up to Y=9, that would be out of bounds and I'd die.\n\n- So, I can't move up.\n\nThat leaves me with down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Down** to (9,8):\n\n   - Looking at the board, column 9 from row 9 down to row 0 seems to be open except for the apple at (9,4).\n\n   - So, moving down is safe for now, but I need to plan ahead to make sure I don't run into my own tail or the enemy.\n\n2. **Left** to (8,9):\n\n   - Row 9, moving left from (9,9) to (8,9).

I don't want to get too close to it.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,8) seems safe, as it's away from the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,9):\n\n- From (8,9), I can continue moving left to (7,9), (6,9), etc.\n\n- But the closest apple is at (9,4), which is down.\n\n- So, moving left wouldn't be as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (9,8) seems like a better choice.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Move down to (9,8)\n\n- Then down to (9,7)\n\n- Then down to (9,6)\n\n- Then down to (9,5)\n\n- Then down to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a direct path to the closest apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll need to decide on the next target.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (9,4) seems like the way to go.\n\nSo, my next move should be down to (9,8).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down is safe.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nSo, at (9,9), which is the rightmost cell, moving down to (9,8) should be fine.\n\nNo obstacles there.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,9) is also safe, but as I thought earlier, it's not as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nHence, moving down to (9,8) is the better choice.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving down towards the closest apple at (9,4) is the most direct path.\n\n- Moving left would take me away from the closest apple.\n\n- Moving up or right is not possible due to board boundaries.\n\n- The path down is clear, and I can proceed without immediate risks from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Continue moving down towards the apple at (9,4).\n\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust path if necessary.\n\n- After eating the apple, assess the positions of remaining apples to determine the next target."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top. My position at (7,9) is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, other snakes, or myself. The goal is to have the most points by the end, which means eating as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . A . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . 1 . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nWith X increasing to the right and Y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (1,5): Column 1, Row 5\n\n- (4,5): Column 4, Row 5\n\n- (9,4): Column 9, Row 4\n\n- (7,3): Column 7, Row 3\n\n- (3,0): Column 3, Row 0\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is Column 2, Row 3.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n2. (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n4. (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n5. (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 6. The next closest are (4,5) and (9,4), both at 7. The farthest is (3,0) at 13.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,3). It's directly below me, so I can move down to reach it.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,3). That's moving down 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between Y=9 and Y=3 on X=7, there are no apples or snakes listed, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is on Y=3, but X=2, so not in my path. So, I can safely move down to (7,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I will have grown, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nAlright, so first move: DOWN.\n\nBut let's think about what's next after eating (7,3). Which apple should I go for next?\n\nAfter eating (7,3), I'll be at (7,3), and the apple at (7,3) will be removed, and a new one will appear, but since there are multiple apples, I think they stay until eaten.\n\nWait, no, in this game, there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one increases my score and grows me.\n\nSo, after eating (7,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0).\n\nMy position will be (7,3). Let's calculate distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is (9,4) at distance 3.\n\nSo, from (7,3), I can move to (9,4).\n\nLet's plot the path:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's 3 steps: right, right, up.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, at (8,3) and (9,3), there are no snakes or apples blocking the path.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0).\n\nFrom (9,4), let's calculate distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nThat's 6 steps: left, left, left, left, left, up.\n\nAgain, I need to ensure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (9,4) and (4,5), there are no listed snakes or apples in the path.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5) at distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nThat's 3 steps: left, left, left.\n\nAgain, check for obstacles. No snakes or apples in the way.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), remaining apple is (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps: down, down, down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut that's 7 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0).\n\nWait, (3,0) is an apple,"

I'm currently at position (7,8), which is towards the top-right of the board.\n\nThere are apples at positions: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), and (3,0). So, multiple apples to go for, which is interesting because I need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (3,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was down, and I was at (7,8). So, if I move down from there, I'll be at (7,7). But let's think bigger picture here.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. Looking at the distances from my current position:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |8-5| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |8-3| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |8-0| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3) with a distance of 5. That seems like a good target.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (7,8) to (7,3). It's straightforward: just move down 5 steps. So, down to (7,7), then (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in my path, so it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path, but since I'm moving in a straight line, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nOnce I'm at (7,3), what's next? Let's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (3,0)\n\nFrom (7,3), the distances to these apples are:\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple now is at (9,4), distance 3.\n\nPath from (7,3) to (9,4):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nSeems straightforward. No obstacles in the way.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'll have grown again. Now, which apple to go for next?\n\nRemaining apples: (1,5), (4,5), (3,0)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |4-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nClosest is (4,5) at distance 6.\n\nPath from (9,4) to (4,5):\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (6,4)\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\nAgain, seems clear. No obstacles.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), remaining apples are (1,5) and (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,5), distances:\n\n- (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,0): |4-3| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nClosest is (1,5), distance 3.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\nStraightforward.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), only (3,0) remains.\n\nFrom (1,5), distance to (3,0):\n\n|1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nPath from (1,5) to (3,0):\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\nThat's 6 steps down and 2 steps right, totaling 8 steps, but the Manhattan distance is 7, so maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\nThat's also 7 steps, matching the Manhattan distance.\n\nI need to choose the path that avoids obstacles. Looking at the board, the second path seems clearer because the first path goes through (1,0), where there's an apple at (3,0), but I need to reach (3,0) anyway.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the second path is better.\n\nBut, to make it efficient, perhaps I can combine movements to pick up multiple apples without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider picking up apples in a different order to minimize total movement.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- Current: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nI already planned a path to (7,3), then (9,4), then (4,5), then (1,5), then (3,0).\n\nLet me calculate the total Manhattan distance for this path:\n\n- (7,8) to (7,3): 5\n\n- (7,3) to (9,4): 3\n\n- (9,4) to (4,5): 6\n\n- (4,5) to (1,5): 3\n\n- (1,5) to (3,0): 7\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nIs there a way to reduce this total distance?\n\nLet's try a different order:\n\n1. (7,8) -> (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n2. (9,4) -> (7,3): |9-7| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n3. (7,3) -> (4,5): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n4. (4,5) -> (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n5. (1,5) -> (3,0): |1-3| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 24\n\nSame total.\n\nWhat if I go to (4,5) first?\n\n1. (7,8) -> (4,5): |7-4| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. (4,5) -> (1,5): |4-1| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. (1,5) -> (7,3): |1-7| + |5-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n4. (7,3) -> (9,4): |7-9| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5. (9,4) -> (3,0): |9-3| + |4-0| = 6 +"

Wait, actually, looking back, my last move was up from (7,8) to (7,9). But I need to correct that: if I moved up from (7,8) to (7,9), but according to the board state, I'm at (7,9), but in the last move information, it says I was at (7,8) and moved up to (7,9). So, I need to make sure I have the current position right.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nSo, row 9, column 7 is where I am, which is (7,9). Okay, got it.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. Let's consider the possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boundaries. Since the board is 10x10, X ranges from 0 to 9, and Y ranges from 0 to 9. So, from (7,9), moving up would be to (7,10), which is off the board, so that's invalid, I can't move up.\n\nMoving down would be to (7,8), left to (6,9), and right to (8,9).\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

My goal is to pick up apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples. Which apple is closest to my current position?\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(1,5), (4,5), (9,4), (7,3), (3,0)\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9):\n\n- (1,5): |7-1| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (4,5): |7-4| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (7,3): |7-7| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (3,0): |7-3| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 6.\n\nLooking at that, it's directly below me, since X is the same, just Y decreases from 9 to 3.\n\nSo, the path would be straightforward: move down step by step until I reach Y=3.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, from (7,9) down to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: .

So, at Y=9, I can't move up anymore because there's no Y=10. So, moving up is invalid; it would hit the wall.\n\nSo, possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n1. **Down** to (8,8):\n\n   - Looking at the board, row 8 is all dots (empty spaces), so it's safe.\n\n   - But I need to think about where this leads me.

I can't do that.\n\nSo, actually, I can't move right either.\n\nTherefore, my possible moves are only down or left.\n\nNow, I need to decide between moving down to (9,8) or left to (8,9).\n\nLet me think about which direction gets me closer to the apples while avoiding the enemy and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's list the distances to each apple from my current position (9,9), using Manhattan distance:\n\n- (1,5): |9-1| + |9-5| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- (4,5): |9-4| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (9,4): |9-9| + |9-4| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |9-7| + |9-3| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (3,0): |9-3| + |9-0| = 6 + 9 = 15\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,4), with a distance of 5.\n\nLet me think about how to get there.\n\nFrom (9,9), moving down to (9,8), then (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), and (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a direct path.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9, columns 9 to 0:\n\n  - Column 9: from Y=9 down to Y=4 is empty, except for the apple at (9,4).\n\n  - So, moving down to (9,4) is clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow in length, so I need to ensure that my path doesn't lead me into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, since I'm moving in a straight line and the column is empty, it should be safe.\n\nAdditionally, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (6,3). I don't want to get too close to it.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,8) seems safe, as it's away from the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,9):\n\n- From (8,9), I can continue moving left to (7,9), (6,9), etc.\n\n- But the closest apple is at (9,4), which is down.\n\n- So, moving left wouldn't be as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (9,8) seems like a better choice.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Move down to (9,8)\n\n- Then down to (9,7)\n\n- Then down to (9,6)\n\n- Then down to (9,5)\n\n- Then down to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a direct path to the closest apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll need to decide on the next target.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (9,4) seems like the way to go.\n\nSo, my next move should be down to (9,8).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down is safe.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nSo, at (9,9), which is the rightmost cell, moving down to (9,8) should be fine.\n\nNo obstacles there.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,9) is also safe, but as I thought earlier, it's not as efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nHence, moving down to (9,8) is the better choice.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving down towards the closest apple at (9,4) is the most direct path.\n\n- Moving left would take me away from the closest apple.\n\n- Moving up or right is not possible due to board boundaries.\n\n- The path down is clear, and I can proceed without immediate risks from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Continue moving down towards the apple at (9,4).\n\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust path if necessary.\n\n- After eating the apple, assess the positions of remaining apples to determine the next target."
