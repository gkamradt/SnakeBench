However, we should be cautious of the enemy snake #2 which is at (9, 0), as we don't want to collide with them.\n\nOne strategy could be to first move towards the apple at (0, 9), as it is the furthest away from the enemy snake. This would allow us to safely grow our body and potentially box out the enemy snake from accessing certain areas of the board.\n\nAfter reaching the apple at (0, 9), we can then start moving towards the other apples while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nFor the next move, let's start heading towards the apple at (0, 9).\n\nNext move: DOWN"

I see that there are apples at (9, 1), (8, 8), (6, 6), (9, 6), and (0, 9).\n\nMy current position is at the right edge of the board, so I have limited options for movement. I also need to be careful not to run into Snake #1, which is at (3, 0).\n\nMy next move will be to move to the right to try and reach the apple at (9, 1). This will also give me more space to maneuver and potentially allow me to reach other apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to move to the right and see if I can reach the apple at (9, 1) without running into Snake #1 or the wall.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
