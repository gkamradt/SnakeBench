The apple at (6,6) is also in a position that has open spaces around it, but the enemy snake is closer to that apple than my position, hence it would not be an optimal choice.\n\nFrom my position, moving up would take me towards the apple at (1,8), while moving left would get me closer to the middle of the board, which could be beneficial in terms of maneuverability, potentially opening up paths both to (2,4) and other remaining apples. It is notable that moving to the left could possibly prompt snake #2 to move towards (1,8), leaving me a clearer path towards (2,4) in the future turns.\n\nFor my next move, I should take one that maintains my path towards (2,4) while not creating any immediate risk. The current state of the board suggests that moving upwards or towards the left would be the best option. However, moving upwards could potentially block my future movements if I grow in size. \n\nConsidering these factors, I'll move left to maintain my previous strategy of heading towards apple at (2,4) while being prepared to change course to apple at (1,8) if snake #2 seems to be heading that way.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

It gives me equal proximity to move towards the apple at (6,6) or (2,4) while keeping my distance from enemy snake #2 and the walls. I could potentially go for the apple at (1,0) too, but that would require much more movement, costing precious time.\n\nAssuming snake #2 moves toward the apple at (1,8), my path to the apple at (2,4) should progress without much issue. Given my clear path and the estimated turns for snake #2 to reach the apple at (1,8), It is better to get the apple at (2,4).\n\nFor my next move, It appears ideal to continue down the board by moving downwards. It will further decrease the distance between me and (2,4) while also ensuring that my path is not blocked by either a wall or my growth.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN.\n\n--End of your last move information.--"
