This direction also keeps your snake in a spacious area, minimizing the risk of collisions and allowing for strategic maneuvering around the enemy snake.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns:**  \nAfter moving **DOWN**, aim to continue towards the lower-left area to collect the apples at (3, 0) and (0, 0). Maintain awareness of the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential conflicts. Once the lower apples are secured, navigate towards the center-top to collect the apple at (5, 3) and eventually the one at (7, 9).\n\n---\n\n**Decided Next Move:**  \n**DOWN**"
