(2, 9)\n3. (9, 0)\n4. (1, 7)\n5. (9, 6)\n\nAdditionally, there's an enemy snake, Snake #2, at position (4, 8) but it doesn't have a body right now, so I only need to be cautious with its head.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- **Immediate Opportunities:** The closest apples to my current position are at (1, 7) and (9, 6). Since I'm at (5, 7), the apple at (1, 7) is four moves left away, whereas (9, 6) is four moves right and one move down.\n  \n- **Threats:** The only immediate threat is the possibility of Snake #2 moving towards (5, 7), potentially causing a conflict, although Snake #2 is currently at (4, 8), it's not in immediate collision course with my snake.\n\n- **Growth Opportunities:** Growing by going to an apple is a top priority. The apple on the far left (1, 7) is quite attractive since it's not too far away and moving to the right doesn't immediately pose a risk of crowding.\n\n### Possible Actions Next Move:\n1. **LEFT to (4, 7):** This move will take me one step closer to the apple at (1, 7), and it doesn't bring me into conflict with Snake #2 right now.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Takes me closer to apples at (9, 6) and (8, 6), but involves longer traversal at this moment. Moving right may also make me vulnerable if Snake #2 starts approaching horizontally in the future, but not an immediate threat.\n\n3. **Considerations for Next Turns:** \n   - If moving LEFT successfully, continue moving LEFT towards (1, 7).\n   - If an opportunity arises to move RIGHT to grab (9, 6), plan appropriately after assessing Snake #2's movements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe safest immediate strategy is to move LEFT towards (1, 7). This not only positions me closer to an apple but control of the board is slightly better at the left without the immediate threat from Snake #2.\n\n**Decided Next Move: LEFT.**"

            "rationale": "Okay, let me think this through...\n\nThe immediate threats seem to be the enemy snake at (5, 7) and the wall at the top of the board. However, the enemy snake doesn't seem to be in a position to immediately block me this turn.\n\nThere are several apples nearby that I could potentially go for:\n- (8, 6) is 4 steps away (up 2, right 2)\n- (2, 9) is 5 steps away (up 1, left 4)\n- (9, 0) is 9 steps away (down 8, right 5)\n- (1, 7) is 3 steps away (down 1, left 3)\n- (9, 6) is 3 steps away (up 2, right 5)\n\nOf these, (1, 7) and (9, 6) seem like the closest and safest options for now. Let me go for (1, 7) as it's only 3 steps away.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to reassess the board and try to go for another nearby apple while avoiding the enemy snake and potential traps.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
