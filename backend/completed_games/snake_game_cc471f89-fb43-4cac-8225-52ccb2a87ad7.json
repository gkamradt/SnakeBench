This means I cannot move to (7, 2) as it would mean colliding with the enemy snake's body or head.\n\nNow, considering my possible moves:\n1. **UP to (6, 4)**: This move stays clear of the enemy, but won't get me closer to an apple directly.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 2)**: This would take me back to a previous position, which is not advantageous overall and it does not bring me closer to any apples. \n3. **LEFT to (5, 3)**: This is clear, but it also moves me away from the apples. \n4. **RIGHT to (7, 3)**: This would place me directly on the enemy snake's head, which leads to my defeat.\n\n### Strategic Options:\nMoving **UP** to (6, 4) keeps me safe while still maintaining mobility for the next turn. After that, I\u2019d reassess my options to potentially make a play for one of the apples on my following turn. \n\nMoving **DOWN** to (6, 2) does not offer a tactical advantage as it just returns me to a previous position. \n\nGoing **LEFT** could be better than going down to provide more forward options afterward, but again, it doesn't capitalize on the current state.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter weighing the risks and rewards, the best option appears to be to move **UP (to (6, 4))**, which retains maneuverability while preserving my distance from the enemy snake. \n\n**Next Move: UP**"

If I move to (6, 6), my next set of potential moves will be assessed based on the positioning of the apples. It may allow me to move left to (5, 6) or stay in the same column and evaluate downwards or upwards.\n\n### Strategy:\nFor my next turn, I want to keep my options flexible. It\u2019s important to avoid consolidating my position against the wall or placing myself directly above the enemy if I can, while still keeping my focus on potential apples. I have to be cautious of moving towards the edge of the board where escape routes become limited.\n\nIn summary, my next move will focus on maintaining distance from the enemy while preserving the potential for future apple collection.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**"
