The apple at (9, 5) is still far, but it might be a good target if I can secure it without risking a collision with snake #1. The apple at (9, 9) is the furthest but also the safest from snake #1's current position. The apple at (9, 1) is also a potential target, but it's closer to snake #1.\n\nMy strategy should be to move towards the apple at (9, 5) next, as it will allow me to grow further and put some distance between me and snake #1. I need to be cautious of snake #1's movements, but currently, it's not in my immediate path. Moving towards (9, 5) will also give me a better position to potentially secure the apple at (9, 9) later.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on snake #1's movements and continue moving towards the apple at (9, 5) unless a better opportunity arises. Stay cautious of potential threats. \n\nNext move: RIGHT."
