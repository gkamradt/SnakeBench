Now, I need to think about my next move. If I move down, I'll be at (3, 5), which is still relatively close to the enemy snake. However, I'm not sure if I want to move down yet, as it might put me in a position where I'm not close to the apple at (2, 9).\n\nMoving left would put me at (2, 6), which is actually closer to the apple at (2, 9) and also closer to the enemy snake. However, I'm not sure if I want to move left yet, as it might put me in a position where I'm not close to the apple at (2, 9).\n\nMoving right would put me at (4, 6), which is a bit further away from the enemy snake, but still not close to the apple at (2, 9).\n\nHmm, I think I'll move left to (2, 6) and then reassess the situation. If I'm still too close to the enemy snake, I can try to move down and get closer to the apple at (2, 9).\n\nNext turn strategy: Try to get closer to the apple at (2, 9) while being cautious of the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
