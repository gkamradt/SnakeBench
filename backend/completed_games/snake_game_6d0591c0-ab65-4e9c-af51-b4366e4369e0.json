However, if that snake moves up toward (8, 5), it could potentially block my access to other apples later. For now, my priority remains on apple collection.\n\n### Strategy Reminder:\nFocus on collecting apples while maintaining awareness of the enemy snake\u2019s movements.

This strengthens my position and contributes to my score.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn:\nAfter collecting the apple, I should consider my next moves carefully.
