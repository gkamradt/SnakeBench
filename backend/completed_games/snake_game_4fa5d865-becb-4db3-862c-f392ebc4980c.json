Since Snake #2 is currently in (1, 9) and doesn't pose an imminent threat to my current position, it should be safe to continue in the direction of the apple while keeping a close observation on Snake #2's moves. If however, Snake #2 tries to move towards the apple, I should reconsider my choices and instead aim for the apple at (5, 1). \n\nNext move: LEFT."
