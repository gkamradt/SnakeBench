            "rationale": "Given the current board state, my snake is at (8, 9), and the nearest apple is at (5, 7). The enemy snake is at (8, 6), which is relatively close, so I need to be cautious about its movements.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid the Enemy Snake:** The enemy snake is directly below me, so moving down would be risky. I should avoid moving in that direction.\n2. **Move Towards the Apple at (5, 7):** This apple is the closest and moving towards it will keep me in a central position, which is generally safer and more strategic.\n3. **Stay Central:** Staying in a central position allows me to have more options for movement and reduces the risk of being cornered.\n\n### Next Move:\n- **UP:** Moving up will bring me closer to the apple at (5, 7) and keep me away from the enemy snake.\n- **LEFT:** Moving left would also be a safe move, but it would not bring me closer to the apple.\n- **RIGHT:** Moving right would take me towards the wall and away from the apple.\n- **DOWN:** Moving down would be dangerous as it brings me closer to the enemy snake.\n\n### Decision:\nI will move **UP** to (9, 9) to continue moving towards the apple at (5, 7) and maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: **UP**"
