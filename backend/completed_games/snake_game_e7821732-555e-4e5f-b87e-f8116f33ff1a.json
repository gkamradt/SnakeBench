However, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake and avoid any potential collisions.\n\nI think my best move is to go DOWN, as that will bring me closer to the apple at (0, 5) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. \n\nMy next move is: DOWN."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . .

A . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . 2 . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (2,0), which is in row 0, column 2.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (0,4): row 4, column 0\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): row 6, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (2,0), I need to move right three times to (5,0), then up once to (5,1). That's a short path: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (2,0) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4). But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (2,0). But there's some confusion because in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake, but I'll go with the initial information that I'm at (2,0).\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (7,8) which is an apple\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots except at (9,6) which is the enemy snake\n\n- Row 5: apple at (5,1)\n\n- Row 4: apple at (0,4)\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots except at (8,2) which is an apple\n\n- Row 1: dots except at (5,1) which is an apple\n\n- Row 0: dots except at (2,0) which is my snake and (0,5) and (0,4) which are apples\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (2,0), which is in row 0, column 2.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): row 6, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (2,0), I need to move right three times to (5,0), then up once to (5,1). That's a short path: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (2,0) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4).

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy.

But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

Maybe there was a mistake, but I'll go with the initial information that I'm at (2,0).\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . .

I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (2,0), I need to move right three times to (5,0), then up once to (5,1). That's a short path: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (2,0) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4). But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (3,1), I need to move right two times to (5,1). That's a very short path.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (3,1) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right and up slightly. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,4), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apples at (0,4) and (0,5), which are at the bottom row. From (5,1), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then right to (0,4) and (0,5). That seems like a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the top edge. It might be risky to go there, especially with the enemy nearby.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards the bottom row apples if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,4), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (3,1), and I need to move right two times to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved up from (2,0) to (2,1), but according to the current position, I'm at (3,1). There might be some confusion about the previous moves, but I'll focus on the current position.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving right to (4,1), then to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), I need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (8,2) is a logical choice because it's in the same general direction, and I can continue moving right and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2).\n\nThat's a total of five moves from my current position:\n\n1. Right to (4,1)\n\n2. Right to (5,1)\n\n3. Right to (6,1)\n\n4. Right to (7,1)\n\n5. Right to (8,1)\n\n6. Up to (8,2)\n\nBut since eating an apple makes my snake grow, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), my body will be at (4,1) and (5,1), with (5,1) being the apple I've eaten.\n\nContinuing to (7,1), my body will be at (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs long as I keep moving right, I shouldn't run into my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious when changing direction, especially if the enemy is moving towards my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,4), it's somewhat distant, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy doesn't interfere immediately, I can proceed with my plan to go for (5,1), then (8,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the apple at (7,8), but that might be risky, or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, my next move is to move right to (4,1).\n\nThen, next turn, I'll move right again to (5,1), eat the apple, and grow.\n\nAfter that, I'll continue moving right towards (8,2).\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy trying to block my path or go for the same apples.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (2,0), I need to move right three times to (5,0), then up once to (5,1). That's a short path: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (2,0) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4). But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

From (5,1), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then right to (0,4) and (0,5). That seems like a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the top edge. It might be risky to go there, especially with the enemy nearby.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards the bottom row apples if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,3), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (4,1), and I need to move right one time to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (8,2) seems like a logical choice because it's in the same general direction, and I can continue moving right and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2).\n\nThat's a total of five moves from my current position:\n\n1. Right to (5,1)\n\n2. Right to (6,1)\n\n3. Right to (7,1)\n\n4. Right to (8,1)\n\n5. Up to (8,2)\n\nBut since eating an apple makes my snake grow, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), my tail will be at (4,1).\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), my body will be at (5,1) and (6,1).\n\nContinuing to (7,1), my body will be at (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs long as I keep moving right, I shouldn't run into my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious when changing direction, especially if the enemy is moving towards my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,3), it's somewhat distant, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy doesn't interfere immediately, I can proceed with my plan to go for (5,1), then (8,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the apple at (7,8), but that might be risky, or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, my next move is to move right to (5,1).\n\nThen, next turn, I'll continue moving right towards (8,2).\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy trying to block my path or go for the same apples.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (5,1). There's some confusion because in the last move information, it says I moved to (4,1), but I need to confirm that.\n\nThere are apples at (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,2), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (7,8) which is an apple\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots\n\n- Row 5: apple at (5,1)\n\n- Row 4: dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots except at (8,2) which is an apple\n\n- Row 1: dots except at (5,1) which is an apple and my snake at (5,1)\n\n- Row 0: dots except at (0,5) and (0,4) which are apples\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,1), which is in row 1, column 5.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,2): row 2, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). Wait, that's my current position. So, I must have just moved there. But according to the last move information, I moved to (4,1), and now I'm at (5,1). So, I've already eaten that apple, and my snake has grown.\n\nWait, there's some confusion here. In the last move information, it says direction: RIGHT, and rationale mentions moving to (4,1), but according to the board state, my snake is at (5,1). Maybe there's a mistake in the last move information.\n\nAssuming that I'm currently at (5,1), and there's an apple at (8,2), another at (7,8), and others at the bottom row.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, to the right and a bit up. The apple at (7,8) is further up and to the left. The apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,2), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,1), I need to move right to (6,1), then (7,1), then (8,1), and finally up to (8,2). That's four moves: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I've just eaten the apple at (5,1), my snake has grown, so I have a tail behind me at (4,1).\n\nAs I move right to (6,1), my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, moving to (7,1), tail at (6,1).\n\nThen to (8,1), tail at (7,1).\n\nFinally, up to (8,2), tail at (8,1).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,2), which is at row 2, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves down and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body or the enemy.\n\nWait, I'm at (5,1), and I need to move right to (6,1). Let me check if (6,1) is occupied.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 1, column 6 is a dot, which means it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1), (8,1), and (8,2) are all dots, except (8,2) is an apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nIn the next turn, I'll move right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,1).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,2), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which would require moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, which might be risky with the enemy nearby.\n\nAlternatively, I could head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I need a better plan.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I'm at (8,2), with my tail at (8,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are down and to the left.\n\nThe apple at (0,2) is down and to the left as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to group the apples.\n\nI could go for (8,2), then head towards (7,8), and then down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that might be risky due to the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't align with the apple positions.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the sequence:\n\n1. Eat (8,2)\n\n2. Move left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), and so on to (7,8)\n\nBut that seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, after (8,2), I could move left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), continuing up to (7,8).\n\nBut I need to assess the risk of the enemy moving towards me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to prioritize the"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4). But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (4,1), and I need to move right one time to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (8,2) seems like a logical choice because it's in the same general direction, and I can continue moving right and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2).\n\nThat's a total of five moves from my current position:\n\n1. Right to (5,1)\n\n2. Right to (6,1)\n\n3. Right to (7,1)\n\n4. Right to (8,1)\n\n5. Up to (8,2)\n\nBut since eating an apple makes my snake grow, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), my tail will be at (4,1).\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), my body will be at (5,1) and (6,1).\n\nContinuing to (7,1), my body will be at (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs long as I keep moving right, I shouldn't run into my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious when changing direction, especially if the enemy is moving towards my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,3), it's somewhat distant, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy doesn't interfere immediately, I can proceed with my plan to go for (5,1), then (8,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the apple at (7,8), but that might be risky, or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, my next move is to move right to (5,1).\n\nThen, next turn, I'll continue moving right towards (8,2).\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy trying to block my path or go for the same apples.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

So, I must have just moved there. But according to the last move information, I moved to (4,1), and now I'm at (5,1). So, I've already eaten that apple, and my snake has grown.\n\nWait, there's some confusion here. In the last move information, it says direction: RIGHT, and rationale mentions moving to (4,1), but according to the board state, my snake is at (5,1). Maybe there's a mistake in the last move information.\n\nAssuming that I'm currently at (5,1), and there's an apple at (8,2), another at (7,8), and others at the bottom row.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, to the right and a bit up. The apple at (7,8) is further up and to the left. The apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,2), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,1), I need to move right to (6,1), then (7,1), then (8,1), and finally up to (8,2). That's four moves: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I've just eaten the apple at (5,1), my snake has grown, so I have a tail behind me at (4,1).\n\nAs I move right to (6,1), my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, moving to (7,1), tail at (6,1).\n\nThen to (8,1), tail at (7,1).\n\nFinally, up to (8,2), tail at (8,1).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,2), which is at row 2, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves down and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body or the enemy.\n\nWait, I'm at (5,1), and I need to move right to (6,1). Let me check if (6,1) is occupied.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 1, column 6 is a dot, which means it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1), (8,1), and (8,2) are all dots, except (8,2) is an apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nIn the next turn, I'll move right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,1).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,2), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which would require moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, which might be risky with the enemy nearby.\n\nAlternatively, I could head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I need a better plan.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I'm at (8,2), with my tail at (8,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are down and to the left.\n\nThe apple at (0,2) is down and to the left as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to group the apples.\n\nI could go for (8,2), then head towards (7,8), and then down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that might be risky due to the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't align with the apple positions.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the sequence:\n\n1. Eat (8,2)\n\n2. Move left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), and so on to (7,8)\n\nBut that seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, after (8,2), I could move left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), continuing up to (7,8).\n\nBut I need to assess the risk of the enemy moving towards me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to prioritize the"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,0), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (2,0). Maybe there was a mistake, but I'll go with the initial information that I'm at (2,0).\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . .

I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (2,0), I need to move right three times to (5,0), then up once to (5,1). That's a short path: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (2,0) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4). But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,4), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apples at (0,4) and (0,5), which are at the bottom row. From (5,1), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then right to (0,4) and (0,5). That seems like a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the top edge. It might be risky to go there, especially with the enemy nearby.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards the bottom row apples if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,4), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (3,1), and I need to move right two times to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved up from (2,0) to (2,1), but according to the current position, I'm at (3,1). There might be some confusion about the previous moves, but I'll focus on the current position.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving right to (4,1), then to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), I need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (8,2) is a logical choice because it's in the same general direction, and I can continue moving right and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2).\n\nThat's a total of five moves from my current position:\n\n1. Right to (4,1)\n\n2. Right to (5,1)\n\n3. Right to (6,1)\n\n4. Right to (7,1)\n\n5. Right to (8,1)\n\n6. Up to (8,2)\n\nBut since eating an apple makes my snake grow, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), my body will be at (4,1) and (5,1), with (5,1) being the apple I've eaten.\n\nContinuing to (7,1), my body will be at (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs long as I keep moving right, I shouldn't run into my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious when changing direction, especially if the enemy is moving towards my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,4), it's somewhat distant, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy doesn't interfere immediately, I can proceed with my plan to go for (5,1), then (8,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the apple at (7,8), but that might be risky, or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, my next move is to move right to (4,1).\n\nThen, next turn, I'll move right again to (5,1), eat the apple, and grow.\n\nAfter that, I'll continue moving right towards (8,2).\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy trying to block my path or go for the same apples.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, to the right and a bit up. The apple at (7,8) is further up and to the left.

That's four moves: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I've just eaten the apple at (5,1), my snake has grown, so I have a tail behind me at (4,1).\n\nAs I move right to (6,1), my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, moving to (7,1), tail at (6,1).\n\nThen to (8,1), tail at (7,1).\n\nFinally, up to (8,2), tail at (8,1).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,2), which is at row 2, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2).

Let me check if (6,1) is occupied.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 1, column 6 is a dot, which means it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1), (8,1), and (8,2) are all dots, except (8,2) is an apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nIn the next turn, I'll move right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,1).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,2), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which would require moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, which might be risky with the enemy nearby.\n\nAlternatively, I could head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I need a better plan.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I'm at (8,2), with my tail at (8,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are down and to the left.\n\nThe apple at (0,2) is down and to the left as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to group the apples.\n\nI could go for (8,2), then head towards (7,8), and then down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that might be risky due to the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't align with the apple positions.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the sequence:\n\n1.

Move right to (6,2)\n\n2. Move right to (7,2)\n\n3.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

Let's see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,0), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (2,0). Maybe there was a mistake, but I'll go with the initial information that I'm at (2,0).\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . 2 . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (2,0), which is in row 0, column 2.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (0,4): row 4, column 0\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): row 6, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (2,0), I need to move right three times to (5,0), then up once to (5,1). That's a short path: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (2,0) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4). But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (7,8) which is an apple\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots\n\n- Row 5: apple at (5,1)\n\n- Row 4: dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots except at (8,2) which is an apple\n\n- Row 1: dots except at (5,1) which is an apple and my snake at (4,1)\n\n- Row 0: dots except at (0,5) and (0,4) which are apples\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (4,1), which is in row 1, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,3): row 3, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's very close. From (4,1), I need to move right one time to (5,1). That's a very short path.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (4,1) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (4,1).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right and up slightly. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,3), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apples at (0,4) and (0,5), which are at the bottom row. From (5,1), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then right to (0,4) and (0,5). That seems like a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the top edge. It might be risky to go there, especially with the enemy nearby.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards the bottom row apples if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,3), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (4,1), and I need to move right one time to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (8,2) seems like a logical choice because it's in the same general direction, and I can continue moving right and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2).\n\nThat's a total of five moves from my current position:\n\n1. Right to (5,1)\n\n2. Right to (6,1)\n\n3. Right to (7,1)\n\n4. Right to (8,1)\n\n5. Up to (8,2)\n\nBut since eating an apple makes my snake grow, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), my tail will be at (4,1).\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), my body will be at (5,1) and (6,1).\n\nContinuing to (7,1), my body will be at (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs long as I keep moving right, I shouldn't run into my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious when changing direction, especially if the enemy is moving towards my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,3), it's somewhat distant, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy doesn't interfere immediately, I can proceed with my plan to go for (5,1), then (8,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the apple at (7,8), but that might be risky, or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, my next move is to move right to (5,1).\n\nThen, next turn, I'll continue moving right towards (8,2).\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy trying to block my path or go for the same apples.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

So, I must have just moved there. But according to the last move information, I moved to (4,1), and now I'm at (5,1). So, I've already eaten that apple, and my snake has grown.\n\nWait, there's some confusion here. In the last move information, it says direction: RIGHT, and rationale mentions moving to (4,1), but according to the board state, my snake is at (5,1). Maybe there's a mistake in the last move information.\n\nAssuming that I'm currently at (5,1), and there's an apple at (8,2), another at (7,8), and others at the bottom row.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, to the right and a bit up. The apple at (7,8) is further up and to the left. The apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,2), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,1), I need to move right to (6,1), then (7,1), then (8,1), and finally up to (8,2). That's four moves: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I've just eaten the apple at (5,1), my snake has grown, so I have a tail behind me at (4,1).\n\nAs I move right to (6,1), my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, moving to (7,1), tail at (6,1).\n\nThen to (8,1), tail at (7,1).\n\nFinally, up to (8,2), tail at (8,1).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,2), which is at row 2, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves down and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body or the enemy.\n\nWait, I'm at (5,1), and I need to move right to (6,1). Let me check if (6,1) is occupied.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 1, column 6 is a dot, which means it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1), (8,1), and (8,2) are all dots, except (8,2) is an apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nIn the next turn, I'll move right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,1).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,2), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which would require moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, which might be risky with the enemy nearby.\n\nAlternatively, I could head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I need a better plan.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I'm at (8,2), with my tail at (8,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are down and to the left.\n\nThe apple at (0,2) is down and to the left as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to group the apples.\n\nI could go for (8,2), then head towards (7,8), and then down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that might be risky due to the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't align with the apple positions.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the sequence:\n\n1.

The apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,0), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,3), I need to move right to (6,3), then (7,3), then (8,3), then down to (8,2). That's four moves: right, right, right, down.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I'm currently at (5,3), and my tail is at (5,1), I need to ensure that as I move, my tail follows and that I don't run into it.\n\nAs I move right to (6,3), my tail will be at (5,2).\n\nThen, moving to (7,3), tail at (6,3).\n\nThen to (8,3), tail at (7,3).\n\nThen down to (8,2), tail at (8,3).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,0), which is at row 0, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves up and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,3).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,3), then right to (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,3).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,0), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the closest apple is (7,8), which is up and to the left.\n\nFrom (8,2), I would need to move up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on, until I reach (7,8).\n\nBut this path might take me closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (0,5) directly.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1), then (7,0), then left to (6,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5).\n\nThis still seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving diagonally if possible, but in Snake, you can only move in straight lines, either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right, and you can't move diagonally.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close to each other, while the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are clustered at the bottom row.\n\nI could consider capturing the top cluster first and then moving down to the bottom cluster.\n\nBut I need to be careful about the enemy's position and movement.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy from certain paths while I collect apples.\n\nHowever, since this is a multi-apple Snake game, and the goal is to have the most points by the end, I should focus on maximizing the number of apples I collect while minimizing the risk of dying.\n\nGiven that, perhaps prioritizing the closer apples and planning a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without exposing myself to the enemy is the way to go.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths again.\n\nStarting from (5,3):\n\n1. Move right to (6,3)\n\n2. Move right to (7,3)\n\n3. Move right to (8,3)\n\n4. Move down to (8,2) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Head up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), up to (7,4), and so on to (7,8).\n\nOption B: Head down to (8,1), then (8,0), left to (7,0), and so on to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nOption C: Head left to (7,3), then down to (7,1), (7,0), left to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nOption D: Some other path.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (9,0), which is at the top row, column 9, and assuming it might try to move towards the apples at (7,8) or the bottom row apples, I need to anticipate its movements.\n\nIf I head towards (7,8), the enemy might try to intercept me or go for the bottom row apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I head towards the bottom row apples, the enemy might go for (7,8).\n\nI need to make a"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (5,4). Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (5,3), but in the latest board state, it's (5,4). I need to confirm that. Let's look again.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\n- Row 4: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . T . . . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (5,4), and its tail is at (5,3). Okay, got it.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,2)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,1) with body at [].\n\nSo, it's just the head at (9,1).\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are apples spread out in different areas: one in the top-right area, one in the top-middle, and three in the bottom row.\n\nI should consider the distance to each apple and the potential paths to get there, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (5,4).\n\n- Apple at (8,2): that's 3 right and 2 down.\n\n- Apple at (7,8): that's 2 right and 4 up.\n\n- Apples at (0,5), (0,4), (0,2): that's 5 down and then move left or right accordingly.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nFirst, I should consider the proximity of the apples. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, only 3 steps right and 2 steps down.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is further away, requiring 2 steps right and 4 steps up.\n\nThe bottom row apples are even further, requiring 5 steps down and then moving horizontally.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for the closest apple first, which is (8,2).\n\nLet me map out a path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nThat's 3 rights and 2 downs.\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail follows and that I don't run into it.\n\nCurrently, my tail is at (5,3), since I'm at (5,4). As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming it's following the standard Snake mechanics.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves, and then each segment follows the one before it.\n\nBut in this game, it seems like the tail moves as you move, so I need to be careful not to move into your own tail.\n\nWait, looking back, in the last move information, it was mentioned that from (5,3), moving up to (5,4), the tail was at (5,2).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify: in Snake, when you move, the entire snake shifts in the direction you're moving, and the tail follows the path the head took previously.\n\nIn this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and as you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves past a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's body growing when it eats an apple and shrinking when it moves without eating.\n\nBut in this game, it's specified that when you eat an apple, you grow and gain a point, and if you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that as I move, I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan a path that avoids my own tail and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, my tail is at (5,3), and I'm at (5,4).\n\nIf I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (7,4), tail moves to (7,3).\n\nThen right to (8,4), tail to (8,3).\n\nThen down to (8,3), but wait, my tail is already there, so that would be a collision.\n\nWait, no, if I move down from (8,4) to (8,3), my tail was at (8,3), but since I just moved, the tail should move to (8,4).\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up in the snake's movement mechanics.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's head movement and assume that the body follows accordingly, as long as there's no self-collision.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body.\n\nSo, for the path to (8,2):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by my body or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, it seems safe to move in that direction.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the others are down.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (7,8), I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, I might give the enemy an opportunity to go for (7,8).\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close, while the bottom row apples are further away.\n\nAlternatively, going for the bottom row apples might be safer since they are clustered together, allowing me to collect multiple apples in one path.\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, then the bottom row apples.\n\nBut moving to (7,8) would require moving up from (8,2):\n\n- Left to (7,2)\n\n- Up to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- ...\n\n- Up to (7,8)\n\nThat seems like a longer path than going directly to the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), moving left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), and so on to (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, from (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on.\n\nEither way, it's a similar number of steps.\n\nI need to think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf I head towards (7,8), the enemy might try to intercept me or go for the bottom row apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, the enemy might go for (7,8).\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, let's plan to go for (8,2), then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and so on to (0,0), then up to"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,0), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (2,0). Maybe there was a mistake, but I'll go with the initial information that I'm at (2,0).\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . .

A . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . 2 . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (2,0), which is in row 0, column 2.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (0,4): row 4, column 0\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): row 6, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (2,0), I need to move right three times to (5,0), then up once to (5,1). That's a short path: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (2,0) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4). But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (7,8) which is an apple\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots\n\n- Row 5: apple at (5,1)\n\n- Row 4: dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots except at (8,2) which is an apple\n\n- Row 1: dots except at (5,1) which is an apple and my snake at (4,1)\n\n- Row 0: dots except at (0,5) and (0,4) which are apples\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (4,1), which is in row 1, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,3): row 3, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's very close. From (4,1), I need to move right one time to (5,1). That's a very short path.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (4,1) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (4,1).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right and up slightly. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,3), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apples at (0,4) and (0,5), which are at the bottom row. From (5,1), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then right to (0,4) and (0,5). That seems like a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the top edge. It might be risky to go there, especially with the enemy nearby.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards the bottom row apples if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,3), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (4,1), and I need to move right one time to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (8,2) seems like a logical choice because it's in the same general direction, and I can continue moving right and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2).\n\nThat's a total of five moves from my current position:\n\n1. Right to (5,1)\n\n2. Right to (6,1)\n\n3. Right to (7,1)\n\n4. Right to (8,1)\n\n5. Up to (8,2)\n\nBut since eating an apple makes my snake grow, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), my tail will be at (4,1).\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), my body will be at (5,1) and (6,1).\n\nContinuing to (7,1), my body will be at (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs long as I keep moving right, I shouldn't run into my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious when changing direction, especially if the enemy is moving towards my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,3), it's somewhat distant, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy doesn't interfere immediately, I can proceed with my plan to go for (5,1), then (8,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the apple at (7,8), but that might be risky, or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, my next move is to move right to (5,1).\n\nThen, next turn, I'll continue moving right towards (8,2).\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy trying to block my path or go for the same apples.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

So, I must have just moved there. But according to the last move information, I moved to (4,1), and now I'm at (5,1). So, I've already eaten that apple, and my snake has grown.\n\nWait, there's some confusion here. In the last move information, it says direction: RIGHT, and rationale mentions moving to (4,1), but according to the board state, my snake is at (5,1). Maybe there's a mistake in the last move information.\n\nAssuming that I'm currently at (5,1), and there's an apple at (8,2), another at (7,8), and others at the bottom row.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, to the right and a bit up. The apple at (7,8) is further up and to the left. The apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,2), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,1), I need to move right to (6,1), then (7,1), then (8,1), and finally up to (8,2). That's four moves: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I've just eaten the apple at (5,1), my snake has grown, so I have a tail behind me at (4,1).\n\nAs I move right to (6,1), my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, moving to (7,1), tail at (6,1).\n\nThen to (8,1), tail at (7,1).\n\nFinally, up to (8,2), tail at (8,1).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,2), which is at row 2, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves down and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body or the enemy.\n\nWait, I'm at (5,1), and I need to move right to (6,1). Let me check if (6,1) is occupied.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 1, column 6 is a dot, which means it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1), (8,1), and (8,2) are all dots, except (8,2) is an apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nIn the next turn, I'll move right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,1).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,2), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which would require moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, which might be risky with the enemy nearby.\n\nAlternatively, I could head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I need a better plan.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I'm at (8,2), with my tail at (8,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are down and to the left.\n\nThe apple at (0,2) is down and to the left as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to group the apples.\n\nI could go for (8,2), then head towards (7,8), and then down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that might be risky due to the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't align with the apple positions.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the sequence:\n\n1.

The apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,0), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,3), I need to move right to (6,3), then (7,3), then (8,3), then down to (8,2). That's four moves: right, right, right, down.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I'm currently at (5,3), and my tail is at (5,1), I need to ensure that as I move, my tail follows and that I don't run into it.\n\nAs I move right to (6,3), my tail will be at (5,2).\n\nThen, moving to (7,3), tail at (6,3).\n\nThen to (8,3), tail at (7,3).\n\nThen down to (8,2), tail at (8,3).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,0), which is at row 0, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves up and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,3).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,3), then right to (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,3).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,0), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the closest apple is (7,8), which is up and to the left.\n\nFrom (8,2), I would need to move up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on, until I reach (7,8).\n\nBut this path might take me closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (0,5) directly.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1), then (7,0), then left to (6,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5).\n\nThis still seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving diagonally if possible, but in Snake, you can only move in straight lines, either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right, and you can't move diagonally.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close to each other, while the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are clustered at the bottom row.\n\nI could consider capturing the top cluster first and then moving down to the bottom cluster.\n\nBut I need to be careful about the enemy's position and movement.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy from certain paths while I collect apples.\n\nHowever, since this is a multi-apple Snake game, and the goal is to have the most points by the end, I should focus on maximizing the number of apples I collect while minimizing the risk of dying.\n\nGiven that, perhaps prioritizing the closer apples and planning a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without exposing myself to the enemy is the way to go.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths again.\n\nStarting from (5,3):\n\n1. Move right to (6,3)\n\n2. Move right to (7,3)\n\n3. Move right to (8,3)\n\n4. Move down to (8,2) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Head up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), up to (7,4), and so on to (7,8).\n\nOption B: Head down to (8,1), then (8,0), left to (7,0), and so on to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nOption C: Head left to (7,3), then down to (7,1), (7,0), left to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nOption D: Some other path.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (9,0), which is at the top row, column 9, and assuming it might try to move towards the apples at (7,8) or the bottom row apples, I need to anticipate its movements.\n\nIf I head towards (7,8), the enemy might try to intercept me or go for the bottom row apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I head towards the bottom row apples, the enemy might go for (7,8).\n\nI need to make a"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (5,4). Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (5,3), but in the latest board state, it's (5,4). I need to confirm that. Let's look again.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\n- Row 4: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . T . . . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (5,4), and its tail is at (5,3). Okay, got it.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,2)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,1) with body at [].\n\nSo, it's just the head at (9,1).\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are apples spread out in different areas: one in the top-right area, one in the top-middle, and three in the bottom row.\n\nI should consider the distance to each apple and the potential paths to get there, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (5,4).\n\n- Apple at (8,2): that's 3 right and 2 down.\n\n- Apple at (7,8): that's 2 right and 4 up.\n\n- Apples at (0,5), (0,4), (0,2): that's 5 down and then move left or right accordingly.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nFirst, I should consider the proximity of the apples. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, only 3 steps right and 2 steps down.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is further away, requiring 2 steps right and 4 steps up.\n\nThe bottom row apples are even further, requiring 5 steps down and then moving horizontally.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for the closest apple first, which is (8,2).\n\nLet me map out a path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nThat's 3 rights and 2 downs.\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail follows and that I don't run into it.\n\nCurrently, my tail is at (5,3), since I'm at (5,4). As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming it's following the standard Snake mechanics.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves, and then each segment follows the one before it.\n\nBut in this game, it seems like the tail moves as you move, so I need to be careful not to move into your own tail.\n\nWait, looking back, in the last move information, it was mentioned that from (5,3), moving up to (5,4), the tail was at (5,2).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify: in Snake, when you move, the entire snake shifts in the direction you're moving, and the tail follows the path the head took previously.\n\nIn this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and as you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves past a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's body growing when it eats an apple and shrinking when it moves without eating.\n\nBut in this game, it's specified that when you eat an apple, you grow and gain a point, and if you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that as I move, I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan a path that avoids my own tail and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, my tail is at (5,3), and I'm at (5,4).\n\nIf I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (7,4), tail moves to (7,3).\n\nThen right to (8,4), tail to (8,3).\n\nThen down to (8,3), but wait, my tail is already there, so that would be a collision.\n\nWait, no, if I move down from (8,4) to (8,3), my tail was at (8,3), but since I just moved, the tail should move to (8,4).\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up in the snake's movement mechanics.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's head movement and assume that the body follows accordingly, as long as there's no self-collision.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body.\n\nSo, for the path to (8,2):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by my body or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, it seems safe to move in that direction.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the others are down.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (7,8), I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, I might give the enemy an opportunity to go for (7,8).\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close, while the bottom row apples are further away.\n\nAlternatively, going for the bottom row apples might be safer since they are clustered together, allowing me to collect multiple apples in one path.\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, then the bottom row apples.\n\nBut moving to (7,8) would require moving up from (8,2):\n\n- Left to (7,2)\n\n- Up to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- ...\n\n- Up to (7,8)\n\nThat seems like a longer path than going directly to the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), moving left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), and so on to (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, from (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on.\n\nEither way, it's a similar number of steps.\n\nI need to think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf I head towards (7,8), the enemy might try to intercept me or go for the bottom row apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, the enemy might go for (7,8).\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, let's plan to go for (8,2), then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and so on to (0,0), then up to"

So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the latest board state, I'm currently at (5,4). My tail is at (5,3).\n\nThere are apples at positions: (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2). There's also an enemy snake at (9,1) with no body segments listed, so it's just the head.\n\nMy last move was up from (5,3) to (5,4), and my rationale was to head towards the closest apple at (8,2).\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move.\n\nLet me consider the positions again:\n\n- I'm at (5,4).\n\n- The apple at (8,2) is still the closest.\n\nTo get to (8,2) from (5,4), I need to move right three times and down two times.\n\nSo, from (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, I don't collide with my own tail or the enemy.\n\nCurrently, my tail is at (5,3). As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming the standard Snake mechanics where the body follows the head.\n\nWait, in Snake, when you move, each segment of the body shifts forward, so the tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was, and so on.\n\nBut in this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and the body follows as you move, growing only when you eat an apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body or the tail.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, moving right to (6,4) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, moving right to (7,4), then to (8,4), then down to (8,3), and finally down to (8,2) should be okay, as long as the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1). If it moves up, it would go to (9,2), which is where one of the apples is, but according to the board state, the apple at (9,2) is already eaten or not present.\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . A 1\n\nSo, there's an apple at (8,2) and the enemy at (9,1).\n\nSo, (9,2) might be empty or have an apple, but according to the list, apples are at (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4), (0,2). So, (9,2) doesn't have an apple.\n\nTherefore, the enemy at (9,1) might move up to (9,2), but there's no apple there, so it might not be beneficial for the enemy to go there.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy could move left or right.\n\nI need to anticipate the enemy's movements and plan accordingly.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path to (8,2):\n\n- Move right to (6,4)\n\n- Move right to (7,4)\n\n- Move right to (8,4)\n\n- Move down to (8,3)\n\n- Move down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail is not blocking my path.\n\nAfter each move, the tail follows the body segments, so as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause the tail to collide with the head, I should be fine.\n\nGiven that, moving right three times and then down twice should be a straight path without sharp turns.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the right, to (6,4).\n\nBut before I decide, let me think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are all in row 0, which is at the bottom.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's position and potential paths.\n\nIf I go for the apples in row 0 after (8,2), I'll need to move down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a considerable distance.\n\nDuring that time, the enemy could potentially move towards the apple at (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,8) after (8,2), I would need to move left to (7,4), then up to (7,8), which is also a distance.\n\nI need to balance between collecting apples quickly and avoiding the enemy.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to collect the closest apples first.\n\nGiven that, going to (8,2) and then to (7,8) might be efficient, but it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, going to (8,2) and then to the bottom row apples might be safer, as the bottom row has multiple apples clustered together.\n\nBut moving down from (8,2) to row 0 would require passing through potentially dangerous areas, depending on the enemy's movements.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nIf I move down towards row 0, I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head up towards (7,8), I might be moving away from the enemy, but it's also farther from the bottom row apples.\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples, but stay aware of the enemy's position.\n\nGiven that, my immediate move should be to the right, towards (6,4).\n\nI need to confirm that this is a safe move.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4) is empty.\n\n- My tail is at (5,3), which should move to (6,3) after I move to (6,4).\n\nThere's no collision with my tail or the enemy.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (6,4) is safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving right to (7,4), then to (8,4), then down to (8,3), and finally to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (8,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nGiven the potential risks of moving down towards the bottom row apples, where the enemy might be moving, perhaps it's better to go for the apple at (7,8) next.\n\nBut that would require moving left and up, which is a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down towards the bottom row apples, I might be able to collect multiple apples in one path, which would be more efficient.\n\nI need to weigh the risks.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with heading towards the bottom row apples after eating (8,2).\n\nSo, after eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction, which is efficient.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0).\n\n3. From there, move up to collect the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nNow, focusing on the immediate move:\n\nI'm at (5,4), and I need to move right to (6,4).\n\nI need to confirm that this is safe.\n\n- (6,4) is empty.\n\n- My tail is at (5,3), which will move to (6,3).\n\nNo collision with my tail or the enemy."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4).

That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (3,1). But there's some confusion because in the last move information, it says I moved to (2,1). Maybe there was a mistake, but I'll go with the current position provided, which is (3,1).\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,4), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (7,8) which is an apple\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots\n\n- Row 5: apple at (5,1)\n\n- Row 4: apple at (0,4)\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots except at (8,2) which is an apple\n\n- Row 1: dots except at (5,1) which is an apple and my snake at (3,1)\n\n- Row 0: dots except at (0,5) and (0,4) which are apples\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4): row 4, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (3,1), I need to move right two times to (5,1). That's a very short path.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (3,1) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right and up slightly. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,4), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apples at (0,4) and (0,5), which are at the bottom row. From (5,1), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then right to (0,4) and (0,5). That seems like a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the top edge. It might be risky to go there, especially with the enemy nearby.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards the bottom row apples if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,4), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (3,1), and I need to move right two times to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved up from (2,0) to (2,1), but according to the current position, I'm at (3,1). There might be some confusion about the previous moves, but I'll focus on the current position.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving right to (4,1), then to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), I need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (8,2) is a logical choice because it's in the same general direction, and I can continue moving right and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2).\n\nThat's a total of five moves from my current position:\n\n1. Right to (4,1)\n\n2. Right to (5,1)\n\n3. Right to (6,1)\n\n4. Right to (7,1)\n\n5. Right to (8,1)\n\n6. Up to (8,2)\n\nBut since eating an apple makes my snake grow, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), my body will be at (4,1) and (5,1), with (5,1) being the apple I've eaten.\n\nContinuing to (7,1), my body will be at (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs long as I keep moving right, I shouldn't run into my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious when changing direction, especially if the enemy is moving towards my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,4), it's somewhat distant, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy doesn't interfere immediately, I can proceed with my plan to go for (5,1), then (8,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the apple at (7,8), but that might be risky, or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, my next move is to move right to (4,1).\n\nThen, next turn, I'll move right again to (5,1), eat the apple, and grow.\n\nAfter that, I'll continue moving right towards (8,2).\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy trying to block my path or go for the same apples.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

That's four moves: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I've just eaten the apple at (5,1), my snake has grown, so I have a tail behind me at (4,1).\n\nAs I move right to (6,1), my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, moving to (7,1), tail at (6,1).\n\nThen to (8,1), tail at (7,1).\n\nFinally, up to (8,2), tail at (8,1).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,2), which is at row 2, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2).

The apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,1), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,2), I need to move right to (6,2), then (7,2), then (8,2). That's three moves: right, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I'm currently at (5,2), and I've just moved up from (5,1), which is my tail.\n\nAs I move right to (6,2), my tail will be at (5,2).\n\nThen, moving to (7,2), tail at (6,2).\n\nThen to (8,2), tail at (7,2).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,1), which is at row 1, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves up and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,2), then right to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,2).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,1), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the closest apple is (7,8), which is up and to the left.\n\nFrom (8,2), I would need to move up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on, until I reach (7,8).\n\nBut this path might take me closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (0,5) directly.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1), then (7,0), then left to (6,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5).\n\nThis still seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving diagonally if possible, but in Snake, you can only move in straight lines, either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right, and you can't move diagonally.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close to each other, while the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are clustered at the bottom row.\n\nI could consider capturing the top cluster first and then moving down to the bottom cluster.\n\nBut I need to be careful about the enemy's position and movement.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy from certain paths while I collect apples.\n\nHowever, since this is a multi-apple Snake game, and the goal is to have the most points by the end, I should focus on maximizing the number of apples I collect while minimizing the risk of dying.\n\nGiven that, perhaps prioritizing the closer apples and planning a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without exposing myself to the enemy is the way to go.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths again.\n\nStarting from (5,2):\n\n1. Move right to (6,2)\n\n2. Move right to (7,2)\n\n3.

That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (5,4). Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (5,3), but in the latest board state, it's (5,4). I need to confirm that. Let's look again.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\n- Row 4: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . T . . . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (5,4), and its tail is at (5,3). Okay, got it.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,2)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,1) with body at [].\n\nSo, it's just the head at (9,1).\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are apples spread out in different areas: one in the top-right area, one in the top-middle, and three in the bottom row.\n\nI should consider the distance to each apple and the potential paths to get there, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (5,4).\n\n- Apple at (8,2): that's 3 right and 2 down.\n\n- Apple at (7,8): that's 2 right and 4 up.\n\n- Apples at (0,5), (0,4), (0,2): that's 5 down and then move left or right accordingly.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nFirst, I should consider the proximity of the apples. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, only 3 steps right and 2 steps down.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is further away, requiring 2 steps right and 4 steps up.\n\nThe bottom row apples are even further, requiring 5 steps down and then moving horizontally.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for the closest apple first, which is (8,2).\n\nLet me map out a path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nThat's 3 rights and 2 downs.\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail follows and that I don't run into it.\n\nCurrently, my tail is at (5,3), since I'm at (5,4). As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming it's following the standard Snake mechanics.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves, and then each segment follows the one before it.\n\nBut in this game, it seems like the tail moves as you move, so I need to be careful not to move into your own tail.\n\nWait, looking back, in the last move information, it was mentioned that from (5,3), moving up to (5,4), the tail was at (5,2).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify: in Snake, when you move, the entire snake shifts in the direction you're moving, and the tail follows the path the head took previously.\n\nIn this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and as you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves past a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's body growing when it eats an apple and shrinking when it moves without eating.\n\nBut in this game, it's specified that when you eat an apple, you grow and gain a point, and if you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that as I move, I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan a path that avoids my own tail and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, my tail is at (5,3), and I'm at (5,4).\n\nIf I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (7,4), tail moves to (7,3).\n\nThen right to (8,4), tail to (8,3).\n\nThen down to (8,3), but wait, my tail is already there, so that would be a collision.\n\nWait, no, if I move down from (8,4) to (8,3), my tail was at (8,3), but since I just moved, the tail should move to (8,4).\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up in the snake's movement mechanics.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's head movement and assume that the body follows accordingly, as long as there's no self-collision.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body.\n\nSo, for the path to (8,2):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by my body or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, it seems safe to move in that direction.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the others are down.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (7,8), I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, I might give the enemy an opportunity to go for (7,8).\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close, while the bottom row apples are further away.\n\nAlternatively, going for the bottom row apples might be safer since they are clustered together, allowing me to collect multiple apples in one path.\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, then the bottom row apples.\n\nBut moving to (7,8) would require moving up from (8,2):\n\n- Left to (7,2)\n\n- Up to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- ...\n\n- Up to (7,8)\n\nThat seems like a longer path than going directly to the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), moving left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), and so on to (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, from (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on.\n\nEither way, it's a similar number of steps.\n\nI need to think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf I head towards (7,8), the enemy might try to intercept me or go for the bottom row apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, the enemy might go for (7,8).\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, let's plan to go for (8,2), then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and so on to (0,0), then up to"

There's also an enemy snake at (9,1) with no body segments listed, so it's just the head.\n\nMy last move was up from (5,3) to (5,4), and my rationale was to head towards the closest apple at (8,2).\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move.\n\nLet me consider the positions again:\n\n- I'm at (5,4).\n\n- The apple at (8,2) is still the closest.\n\nTo get to (8,2) from (5,4), I need to move right three times and down two times.\n\nSo, from (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, I don't collide with my own tail or the enemy.\n\nCurrently, my tail is at (5,3). As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming the standard Snake mechanics where the body follows the head.\n\nWait, in Snake, when you move, each segment of the body shifts forward, so the tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was, and so on.\n\nBut in this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and the body follows as you move, growing only when you eat an apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body or the tail.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, moving right to (6,4) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, moving right to (7,4), then to (8,4), then down to (8,3), and finally down to (8,2) should be okay, as long as the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1). If it moves up, it would go to (9,2), which is where one of the apples is, but according to the board state, the apple at (9,2) is already eaten or not present.\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . A 1\n\nSo, there's an apple at (8,2) and the enemy at (9,1).\n\nSo, (9,2) might be empty or have an apple, but according to the list, apples are at (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4), (0,2). So, (9,2) doesn't have an apple.\n\nTherefore, the enemy at (9,1) might move up to (9,2), but there's no apple there, so it might not be beneficial for the enemy to go there.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy could move left or right.\n\nI need to anticipate the enemy's movements and plan accordingly.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path to (8,2):\n\n- Move right to (6,4)\n\n- Move right to (7,4)\n\n- Move right to (8,4)\n\n- Move down to (8,3)\n\n- Move down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail is not blocking my path.\n\nAfter each move, the tail follows the body segments, so as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause the tail to collide with the head, I should be fine.\n\nGiven that, moving right three times and then down twice should be a straight path without sharp turns.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the right, to (6,4).\n\nBut before I decide, let me think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are all in row 0, which is at the bottom.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's position and potential paths.\n\nIf I go for the apples in row 0 after (8,2), I'll need to move down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a considerable distance.\n\nDuring that time, the enemy could potentially move towards the apple at (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,8) after (8,2), I would need to move left to (7,4), then up to (7,8), which is also a distance.\n\nI need to balance between collecting apples quickly and avoiding the enemy.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to collect the closest apples first.\n\nGiven that, going to (8,2) and then to (7,8) might be efficient, but it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, going to (8,2) and then to the bottom row apples might be safer, as the bottom row has multiple apples clustered together.\n\nBut moving down from (8,2) to row 0 would require passing through potentially dangerous areas, depending on the enemy's movements.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nIf I move down towards row 0, I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head up towards (7,8), I might be moving away from the enemy, but it's also farther from the bottom row apples.\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples, but stay aware of the enemy's position.\n\nGiven that, my immediate move should be to the right, towards (6,4).\n\nI need to confirm that this is a safe move.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4) is empty.\n\n- My tail is at (5,3), which should move to (6,3) after I move to (6,4).\n\nThere's no collision with my tail or the enemy.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (6,4) is safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving right to (7,4), then to (8,4), then down to (8,3), and finally to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (8,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nGiven the potential risks of moving down towards the bottom row apples, where the enemy might be moving, perhaps it's better to go for the apple at (7,8) next.\n\nBut that would require moving left and up, which is a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down towards the bottom row apples, I might be able to collect multiple apples in one path, which would be more efficient.\n\nI need to weigh the risks.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with heading towards the bottom row apples after eating (8,2).\n\nSo, after eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction, which is efficient.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0).\n\n3. From there, move up to collect the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nNow, focusing on the immediate move:\n\nI'm at (5,4), and I need to move right to (6,4).\n\nI need to confirm that this is safe.\n\n- (6,4) is empty.\n\n- My tail is at (5,3), which will move to (6,3).\n\nNo collision with my tail or the enemy."

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the latest board state, I'm currently at (6,5). Wait, in the previous information, it said I was at (5,4), but in the latest board state, it shows me at (6,5). I need to confirm my current position.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . T 2 . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . .

Wait, but in the coordinate system, it's (x,y), with x increasing to the right and y increasing upwards. So, (6,5) would be column 6, row 5.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n\nIn the board state, rows are listed from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom. Columns are labeled from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, position (x,y) corresponds to column x, row y.\n\nTherefore, (6,5) is column 6, row 5.\n\nBut in the board state, row 5 has 'A . . . . T 2 . . .', which is column 0 to 9.\n\nSo, 'T' is at column 5, row 5, and '2' is at column 6, row 5.\n\nTherefore, my head is at (6,5), and my tail is at (5,5).\n\nWait, but in the previous move, it was mentioned that I was at (5,4) with tail at (5,3). There might be some confusion here.\n\nLet me check the last move information again.\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nRationale: ...\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nWait, it seems like there's some discrepancy in the positions provided. In the board state, I'm at (6,5), but in the last move information, it was mentioned as (5,4). Maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the coordinates.\n\nAssuming the board state is accurate, I'll proceed with my current position at (6,5).\n\nNow, there are apples at (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,3) with no body segments.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path to collect these apples without colliding with the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple.\n\nI'm at (6,5), and the apples are at:\n\n- (8,2): That's 2 units up and 4 to the right.\n\n- (7,8): 3 units up and 1 to the right.\n\n- (0,5): 5 units down.\n\n- (0,4): 5 units down and 1 to the left.\n\n- (0,2): 5 units down and 4 to the left.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be (7,8), which is only 3 units up and 1 to the right.\n\nAlternatively, (8,2) is farther, requiring 4 units to the right and 3 units down.\n\nConsidering the positions, perhaps (7,8) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (9,3), which is row 3, column 9.\n\nSo, to get to (7,8), I would need to move up to (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (6,7) -> (6,8), then left to (7,8).\n\nBut I'm already at (6,5), so up to (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), then right to (7,8).\n\nWait, no, moving right would be increasing x-coordinate.\n\nWait, I'm at (6,5). To move up, y increases.\n\nSo, up to (6,6), then (6,7), (6,8), then right to (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (6,5):\n\n- Up to (6,6): empty.\n\n- Up to (6,7): empty.\n\n- Up to (6,8): empty.\n\n- Right to (7,8): has an apple.\n\nSo, that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,2):\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Right to (7,5), (8,5), then down to (8,4), (8,3), (8,2).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (9,3), moving towards (7,8) might be safer, as it's away from the enemy.\n\nAlso, after eating (7,8), I can plan to go for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, going for (0,5), which is directly down, but that's a longer path, and the enemy might intercept me.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (7,8) first is better.\n\nLet me think about the path in more detail.\n\nPath to (7,8):\n\n1. Up to (6,6)\n\n2. Up to (6,7)\n\n3. Up to (6,8)\n\n4. Right to (7,8)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,8), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can plan to go for another apple.\n\nAfter (7,8), perhaps I can head down towards (0,5), (0,4), (0,2).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (7,8) to row 0, which is a long path.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for (8,2) after (7,8).\n\nFrom (7,8), to (8,2):\n\n- Right to (8,8)\n\n- Down to (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)\n\nThat's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,8), I can move down to (7,7), (7,6), etc., but it's still a distance.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apples in row 0 next.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) directly.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Down to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), then left to (5,0), (4,0), ..., (0,0), then up to (0,5).\n\nThat's a very long path.\n\nAlternatively, I can move left to (5,5), then down to (5,4), (5,3), ..., (5,0), then left to (0,0), then up to (0,5).\n\nStill a long path.\n\nGiven that, going for (7,8) first seems more efficient.\n\nAfter eating (7,8), I can consider moving down towards the other apples.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy's movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,3). If it moves left, it can approach me.\n\nI need to keep a safe distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps after eating (7,8), I should head towards the center or another apple quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps going for (8,2) first is better.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Right to (7,5)\n\n- Right to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nThat's 3 moves right and 3 moves down.\n\nTotal of 6 moves.\n\nWhereas going to (7,8) is 3 moves up and 1 move right, total of 4 moves.\n\nSo, faster to get to (7,8).\n\nAfter eating (7,8), I can decide to head towards (8,2) or the bottom row apples.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (7,8) first is better.\n\nAlso, it's important to consider that the enemy might be trying to reach the apples as well.\n\nIf I go for (7,8), the enemy would have to move up to reach it, but it's at (9,3), which is farther away.\n\nSo, I have a better chance of"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0).

Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,0), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (2,0). Maybe there was a mistake, but I'll go with the initial information that I'm at (2,0).\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . .

I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (2,0), I need to move right three times to (5,0), then up once to (5,1). That's a short path: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (2,0) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4). But that seems suboptimal because the apples at (5,1) and (8,2) are closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), and up to (5,1).\n\nBut I'm already at (2,0), so moving right three times seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left from (3,0) to (2,0), which might not be the best decision if my goal is to reach (5,1).\n\nMaybe I should have stayed at (3,0) or moved right from there.\n\nWell, I'm here now at (2,0), so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,0), then to (4,0), to (5,0), up to (5,1).\n\nOption 2: Move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then right to (5,1).\n\nWait, moving up from (2,0) to (2,1): is there an apple at (2,1)? No, according to the board, it's empty.\n\nThen, moving right from (2,1) to (5,1).\n\nThat could work too.\n\nLet me compare the two paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0)\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\nTotal moves: 4\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves, but Path 1 keeps me lower on the board, closer to the bottom, while Path 2 moves me up slightly.\n\nConsidering that the enemy is up high at (9,6), maybe staying lower is safer.\n\nAlso, Path 1 might be better because after reaching (5,1), I can continue right towards (8,2), which is also to the right.\n\nIn Path 2, after reaching (5,1), I would need to move right to (8,2), which is still feasible.\n\nBut Path 1 seems slightly more efficient in terms of direction.\n\nMoreover, in Path 1, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,0), which is fine.\n\nThen, moving right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), and up to (8,2).\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nIn Path 2, after eating (5,1), my tail is at (2,1), and then I can move right to (6,1), etc.\n\nEither way, both paths seem viable.\n\nBut since I'm already at (2,0), and to start Path 1, I need to move right to (3,0), and then continue right and up.\n\nSo, my immediate next move should be right.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,0). Maybe I should correct that and start moving right now.\n\nYes, I think that's the best course of action.\n\nSo, my next move is right.\n\nBut before I confirm that, let me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), right to (5,0), up to (5,1), and eat the apple, my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can continue right to (6,1"

That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (4,1). There's some confusion because in the last move information, it says I moved to (4,1), but I need to confirm that.\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,3), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (7,8) which is an apple\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots\n\n- Row 5: apple at (5,1)\n\n- Row 4: dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots except at (8,2) which is an apple\n\n- Row 1: dots except at (5,1) which is an apple and my snake at (4,1)\n\n- Row 0: dots except at (0,5) and (0,4) which are apples\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (4,1), which is in row 1, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,3): row 3, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's very close. From (4,1), I need to move right one time to (5,1). That's a very short path.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (4,1) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (4,1).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right and up slightly. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,3), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apples at (0,4) and (0,5), which are at the bottom row. From (5,1), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then right to (0,4) and (0,5). That seems like a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the top edge. It might be risky to go there, especially with the enemy nearby.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards the bottom row apples if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,3), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (4,1), and I need to move right one time to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.

Maybe there's a mistake in the last move information.\n\nAssuming that I'm currently at (5,1), and there's an apple at (8,2), another at (7,8), and others at the bottom row.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, to the right and a bit up. The apple at (7,8) is further up and to the left. The apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,2), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,1), I need to move right to (6,1), then (7,1), then (8,1), and finally up to (8,2). That's four moves: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I've just eaten the apple at (5,1), my snake has grown, so I have a tail behind me at (4,1).\n\nAs I move right to (6,1), my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, moving to (7,1), tail at (6,1).\n\nThen to (8,1), tail at (7,1).\n\nFinally, up to (8,2), tail at (8,1).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,2), which is at row 2, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves down and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body or the enemy.\n\nWait, I'm at (5,1), and I need to move right to (6,1). Let me check if (6,1) is occupied.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 1, column 6 is a dot, which means it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1), (8,1), and (8,2) are all dots, except (8,2) is an apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to move right to (6,1).\n\nIn the next turn, I'll move right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), and finally up to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,1).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,2), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which would require moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, which might be risky with the enemy nearby.\n\nAlternatively, I could head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I need a better plan.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I'm at (8,2), with my tail at (8,1).\n\nFrom there, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) are down and to the left.\n\nThe apple at (0,2) is down and to the left as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to group the apples.\n\nI could go for (8,2), then head towards (7,8), and then down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that might be risky due to the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving down to (8,1), then left to (7,1), then down to (7,0), then right to (7,5) and (7,4), but that doesn't align with the apple positions.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the sequence:\n\n1.

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (5,3). There's an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,0), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (7,8) which is an apple\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots\n\n- Row 5: dot at (5,4)\n\n- Row 4: dot at (5,3)\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots except at (8,2) which is an apple\n\n- Row 1: dots except at (5,1) which is my snake's tail, and (9,1) which is the enemy snake\n\n- Row 0: dots except at (0,5) and (0,4) which are apples\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,3), which is in row 3, column 5.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,0): row 0, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (8,2). It's relatively close, to the right and in the same row. The apple at (7,8) is further up and to the left. The apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,0), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,3), I need to move right to (6,3), then (7,3), then (8,3), then down to (8,2). That's four moves: right, right, right, down.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I'm currently at (5,3), and my tail is at (5,1), I need to ensure that as I move, my tail follows and that I don't run into it.\n\nAs I move right to (6,3), my tail will be at (5,2).\n\nThen, moving to (7,3), tail at (6,3).\n\nThen to (8,3), tail at (7,3).\n\nThen down to (8,2), tail at (8,3).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,0), which is at row 0, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves up and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,3).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,3), then right to (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,3).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,0), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the closest apple is (7,8), which is up and to the left.\n\nFrom (8,2), I would need to move up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on, until I reach (7,8).\n\nBut this path might take me closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (0,5) directly.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1), then (7,0), then left to (6,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5).\n\nThis still seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving diagonally if possible, but in Snake, you can only move in straight lines, either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right, and you can't move diagonally.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close to each other, while the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are clustered at the bottom row.\n\nI could consider capturing the top cluster first and then moving down to the bottom cluster.\n\nBut I need to be careful about the enemy's position and movement.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy from certain paths while I collect apples.\n\nHowever, since this is a multi-apple Snake game, and the goal is to have the most points by the end, I should focus on maximizing the number of apples I collect while minimizing the risk of dying.\n\nGiven that, perhaps prioritizing the closer apples and planning a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without exposing myself to the enemy is the way to go.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths again.\n\nStarting from (5,3):\n\n1. Move right to (6,3)\n\n2. Move right to (7,3)\n\n3. Move right to (8,3)\n\n4. Move down to (8,2) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Head up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), up to (7,4), and so on to (7,8).\n\nOption B: Head down to (8,1), then (8,0), left to (7,0), and so on to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nOption C: Head left to (7,3), then down to (7,1), (7,0), left to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nOption D: Some other path.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (9,0), which is at the top row, column 9, and assuming it might try to move towards the apples at (7,8) or the bottom row apples, I need to anticipate its movements.\n\nIf I head towards (7,8), the enemy might try to intercept me or go for the bottom row apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I head towards the bottom row apples, the enemy might go for (7,8).\n\nI need to make a"

That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (5,4). Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (5,3), but in the latest board state, it's (5,4). I need to confirm that. Let's look again.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\n- Row 4: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . T . . . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (5,4), and its tail is at (5,3). Okay, got it.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,2)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,1) with body at [].\n\nSo, it's just the head at (9,1).\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are apples spread out in different areas: one in the top-right area, one in the top-middle, and three in the bottom row.\n\nI should consider the distance to each apple and the potential paths to get there, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (5,4).\n\n- Apple at (8,2): that's 3 right and 2 down.\n\n- Apple at (7,8): that's 2 right and 4 up.\n\n- Apples at (0,5), (0,4), (0,2): that's 5 down and then move left or right accordingly.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nFirst, I should consider the proximity of the apples. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, only 3 steps right and 2 steps down.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is further away, requiring 2 steps right and 4 steps up.\n\nThe bottom row apples are even further, requiring 5 steps down and then moving horizontally.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for the closest apple first, which is (8,2).\n\nLet me map out a path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nThat's 3 rights and 2 downs.\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail follows and that I don't run into it.\n\nCurrently, my tail is at (5,3), since I'm at (5,4). As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming it's following the standard Snake mechanics.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves, and then each segment follows the one before it.\n\nBut in this game, it seems like the tail moves as you move, so I need to be careful not to move into your own tail.\n\nWait, looking back, in the last move information, it was mentioned that from (5,3), moving up to (5,4), the tail was at (5,2).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify: in Snake, when you move, the entire snake shifts in the direction you're moving, and the tail follows the path the head took previously.\n\nIn this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and as you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves past a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's body growing when it eats an apple and shrinking when it moves without eating.\n\nBut in this game, it's specified that when you eat an apple, you grow and gain a point, and if you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that as I move, I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan a path that avoids my own tail and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, my tail is at (5,3), and I'm at (5,4).\n\nIf I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (7,4), tail moves to (7,3).\n\nThen right to (8,4), tail to (8,3).\n\nThen down to (8,3), but wait, my tail is already there, so that would be a collision.\n\nWait, no, if I move down from (8,4) to (8,3), my tail was at (8,3), but since I just moved, the tail should move to (8,4).\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up in the snake's movement mechanics.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's head movement and assume that the body follows accordingly, as long as there's no self-collision.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body.\n\nSo, for the path to (8,2):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by my body or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, it seems safe to move in that direction.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the others are down.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (7,8), I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, I might give the enemy an opportunity to go for (7,8).\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close, while the bottom row apples are further away.\n\nAlternatively, going for the bottom row apples might be safer since they are clustered together, allowing me to collect multiple apples in one path.\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, then the bottom row apples.\n\nBut moving to (7,8) would require moving up from (8,2):\n\n- Left to (7,2)\n\n- Up to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- ...\n\n- Up to (7,8)\n\nThat seems like a longer path than going directly to the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), moving left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), and so on to (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, from (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on.\n\nEither way, it's a similar number of steps.\n\nI need to think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf I head towards (7,8), the enemy might try to intercept me or go for the bottom row apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, the enemy might go for (7,8).\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, let's plan to go for (8,2), then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and so on to (0,0), then up to"

As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming the standard Snake mechanics where the body follows the head.\n\nWait, in Snake, when you move, each segment of the body shifts forward, so the tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was, and so on.\n\nBut in this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and the body follows as you move, growing only when you eat an apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body or the tail.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, moving right to (6,4) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, moving right to (7,4), then to (8,4), then down to (8,3), and finally down to (8,2) should be okay, as long as the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1). If it moves up, it would go to (9,2), which is where one of the apples is, but according to the board state, the apple at (9,2) is already eaten or not present.\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . A 1\n\nSo, there's an apple at (8,2) and the enemy at (9,1).\n\nSo, (9,2) might be empty or have an apple, but according to the list, apples are at (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4), (0,2). So, (9,2) doesn't have an apple.\n\nTherefore, the enemy at (9,1) might move up to (9,2), but there's no apple there, so it might not be beneficial for the enemy to go there.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy could move left or right.\n\nI need to anticipate the enemy's movements and plan accordingly.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path to (8,2):\n\n- Move right to (6,4)\n\n- Move right to (7,4)\n\n- Move right to (8,4)\n\n- Move down to (8,3)\n\n- Move down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail is not blocking my path.\n\nAfter each move, the tail follows the body segments, so as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause the tail to collide with the head, I should be fine.\n\nGiven that, moving right three times and then down twice should be a straight path without sharp turns.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the right, to (6,4).\n\nBut before I decide, let me think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are all in row 0, which is at the bottom.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's position and potential paths.\n\nIf I go for the apples in row 0 after (8,2), I'll need to move down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a considerable distance.\n\nDuring that time, the enemy could potentially move towards the apple at (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,8) after (8,2), I would need to move left to (7,4), then up to (7,8), which is also a distance.\n\nI need to balance between collecting apples quickly and avoiding the enemy.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to collect the closest apples first.\n\nGiven that, going to (8,2) and then to (7,8) might be efficient, but it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, going to (8,2) and then to the bottom row apples might be safer, as the bottom row has multiple apples clustered together.\n\nBut moving down from (8,2) to row 0 would require passing through potentially dangerous areas, depending on the enemy's movements.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nIf I move down towards row 0, I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head up towards (7,8), I might be moving away from the enemy, but it's also farther from the bottom row apples.\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples, but stay aware of the enemy's position.\n\nGiven that, my immediate move should be to the right, towards (6,4).\n\nI need to confirm that this is a safe move.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4) is empty.\n\n- My tail is at (5,3), which should move to (6,3) after I move to (6,4).\n\nThere's no collision with my tail or the enemy.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (6,4) is safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving right to (7,4), then to (8,4), then down to (8,3), and finally to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (8,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nGiven the potential risks of moving down towards the bottom row apples, where the enemy might be moving, perhaps it's better to go for the apple at (7,8) next.\n\nBut that would require moving left and up, which is a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down towards the bottom row apples, I might be able to collect multiple apples in one path, which would be more efficient.\n\nI need to weigh the risks.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with heading towards the bottom row apples after eating (8,2).\n\nSo, after eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction, which is efficient.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0).\n\n3. From there, move up to collect the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nNow, focusing on the immediate move:\n\nI'm at (5,4), and I need to move right to (6,4).\n\nI need to confirm that this is safe.\n\n- (6,4) is empty.\n\n- My tail is at (5,3), which will move to (6,3).\n\nNo collision with my tail or the enemy."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). There are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (3,0), which is on the bottom row, third column from the left. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nApples are scattered around: one at (5,1), which is not too far from me; another at (8,2), which is further to the right; one at (7,8), up near the enemy; and two at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side, near the top.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close; I'm at (3,0), so that's two steps right and one up. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. From (3,0), moving right to (4,0), then (5,0), and then up to (5,1). Does that path seem clear? According to the board state, it looks like there are only dots (empty spaces) in those positions, so it should be okay.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path to the next apple.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (4,0).\n\n2. Move right to (5,0).\n\n3. Move up to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, with the growth, my tail would stay at (3,0).\n\nNext, I could look towards the apple at (8,2). From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). But wait, there's an apple at (8,2), but looking at the board, position (8,2) is already marked with an 'A', so that's fine.\n\nSo, path from (5,1):\n\n1. Right to (6,1).\n\n2. Right to (7,1).\n\n3. Right to (8,1).\n\n4. Up to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating this apple, I would grow again, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or hit my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (7,8), which is higher up and to the right. But that seems pretty far. From (3,0), going to (7,8) would require moving right four times and up eight times. That's a long path, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own tail if I'm not careful.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples at (0,5) and (0,4), which are on the left side near the top. Those might be easier to reach after getting the closer apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,7), and it might be moving towards the apples as well. I need to try to predict its movements and avoid collisions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves or its strategy. So, I should plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,7), and it could potentially move up or down, left or right, but it's near the top-right corner, so its movement options are somewhat limited.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up apples efficiently without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nMaybe I should start by going for the apple at (5,1), then proceed to (8,2), and then see the situation.\n\nBut let's think about the board state more carefully.\n\nAt turn 0:\n\n- My head is at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy is at (9,7).\n\n- Apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4).\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- I eat the apple, grow, so my tail is now at (3,0).\n\n- Enemy could have moved; I don't know its move.\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n- From (5,1), right to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), up to (8,2).\n\n- After eating, I grow again, tail is now at (5,1).\n\n- Enemy could have moved further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (0,5) or (0,4) after (5,1), since they are on the left side.\n\nBut that would require moving left after going right, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, from (5,1), to go to (0,5), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then up four times to (0,5).\n\nThat's a total of five left and four up moves.\n\nBut during this path, I might be exposing myself to the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my own tail blocks my path.\n\nWait, after eating the first apple at (5,1), my tail is at (3,0). Then, moving left to (4,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is already occupied by my tail, so that might not be a problem immediately.\n\nActually, snakes typically leave their tail in places they've been, but in this game, it seems that the tail stays where the head was previously, depending on the implementation.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, the tail stays where it was, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n\nIn this game, it seems that when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but in terms of movement, each part of the snake's body shifts forward.\n\nSo, in this case, when I move from (3,0) to (4,0), my tail remains at (3,0). Then, moving to (5,0), the tail moves to (4,0), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead the head to a position where the tail is blocking the way.\n\nIn the path to (5,1), from (3,0):\n\n1. Right to (4,0).\n\n2. Right to (5,0).\n\n3. Up to (5,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail is at (3,0).\n\nThen, moving to (8,2):\n\n4. Right to (6,0).\n\nWait, no, from (5,1), right to (6,1), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize this step by step.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- My head: (3,0)\n\n- Tail: N/A (assuming just the head for now)\n\nAfter moving right to (4,0):\n\n- Head: (4,0)\n\n- Tail: (3,0)\n\nAfter moving right to (5,0):\n\n- Head: (5,0)\n\n- Tail: (4,0)\n\nAfter moving up to (5,1):\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,0)\n\nSince there was an apple at (5,1), I eat it and grow, so tail remains at (5,0).\n\nNow, from (5,1), let's say I move right to (6,1):\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nThen right to (7,1):\n\n- Head: (7,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nThen right to (8,1):\n\n- Head: (8,1)\n\n- Tail: (7,1)\n\nThen up to (8,2):\n\n- Head: (8,2)\n\n- Tail: (8,1)\n\nEating the apple at (8,2), I grow, so tail remains at (8,1).\n\nThis seems okay so far.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible movements. If the enemy is at (9,7), and it's trying to reach apples, it might move down towards (9,2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (5,1), but that would require moving up seven times from (5,1) to (5,8), then right two times to (7,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apples at (0,5) and (0,4) after (5,1) might be a better strategy, as it keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (5,1), to"

Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,6), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,5). That's left and up from my current position. From (2,0), I would need to move left two times to (0,0), then up five times to (0,5). That's a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,5), so after getting (0,5), I could easily go down to (0,4).\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the enemy. It might be risky to go there.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards (7,8) if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (2,0), and I need to move right three times to reach (5,0), then up to (5,1).\n\nBut in the last move information, it says I moved left, but according to the initial position, I'm at (2,0), which is different from (3,0). Maybe there was a mistake earlier.\n\nAnyway, to move towards (5,1), I need to move right.\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved left, but that doesn't make sense if I'm trying to reach (5,1), which is to the right.\n\nMaybe I need to correct my strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps in the last move, I was at (3,0), moved left to (2,0), and now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nIn that case, I'm now at (2,0), and I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving right towards (5,1).\n\nIf I continue moving left, I can reach (0,0), then move up to (0,5) and (0,4).

That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (3,1). But there's some confusion because in the last move information, it says I moved to (2,1). Maybe there was a mistake, but I'll go with the current position provided, which is (3,1).\n\nThere are apples at (5,1), (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), and (0,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,4), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (7,8) which is an apple\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots\n\n- Row 5: apple at (5,1)\n\n- Row 4: apple at (0,4)\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots except at (8,2) which is an apple\n\n- Row 1: dots except at (5,1) which is an apple and my snake at (3,1)\n\n- Row 0: dots except at (0,5) and (0,4) which are apples\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (5,1): row 1, column 5\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4): row 4, column 9\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance and the potential path to each apple, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It's relatively close. From (3,1), I need to move right two times to (5,1). That's a very short path.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (3,1) and (5,1), there are only dots, which are empty spaces. So, it should be clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), I will grow, so my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nThen, I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is next.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is further to the right and up slightly. From (5,1), I would need to move right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy is at (9,4), which is up and to the right. If I move towards (8,2), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apples at (0,4) and (0,5), which are at the bottom row. From (5,1), I would need to move left five times to (0,1), then down to (0,0), then right to (0,4) and (0,5). That seems like a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could move towards the apples as well.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,8) is up and to the right, near the top edge. It might be risky to go there, especially with the enemy nearby.\n\nConsidering the positions, I think it's better to go for the closer apples first, starting with (5,1), then (8,2), and perhaps then heading towards the bottom row apples if possible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered by the enemy. The enemy is at (9,4), and it could move towards the center or towards the apples.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. However, since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I'll have to make decisions based on the current board state.\n\nLet me think about my immediate next move.\n\nI'm at (3,1), and I need to move right two times to reach (5,1).\n\nSo, my next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says I moved up from (2,0) to (2,1), but according to the current position, I'm at (3,1). There might be some confusion about the previous moves, but I'll focus on the current position.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving right to (4,1), then to (5,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), I need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (8,2) is a logical choice because it's in the same general direction, and I can continue moving right and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving right three times to (8,1), then up to (8,2).\n\nThat's a total of five moves from my current position:\n\n1. Right to (4,1)\n\n2. Right to (5,1)\n\n3. Right to (6,1)\n\n4. Right to (7,1)\n\n5. Right to (8,1)\n\n6. Up to (8,2)\n\nBut since eating an apple makes my snake grow, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), my body will be at (4,1) and (5,1), with (5,1) being the apple I've eaten.\n\nContinuing to (7,1), my body will be at (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs long as I keep moving right, I shouldn't run into my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious when changing direction, especially if the enemy is moving towards my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,4), it's somewhat distant, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy doesn't interfere immediately, I can proceed with my plan to go for (5,1), then (8,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the apple at (7,8), but that might be risky, or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, my next move is to move right to (4,1).\n\nThen, next turn, I'll move right again to (5,1), eat the apple, and grow.\n\nAfter that, I'll continue moving right towards (8,2).\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy trying to block my path or go for the same apples.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

That's four moves: right, right, right, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I've just eaten the apple at (5,1), my snake has grown, so I have a tail behind me at (4,1).\n\nAs I move right to (6,1), my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, moving to (7,1), tail at (6,1).\n\nThen to (8,1), tail at (7,1).\n\nFinally, up to (8,2), tail at (8,1).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,2), which is at row 2, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2).

The apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are at the bottom row, which would require moving down a lot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,1), which is at the top row, column 9, I might want to avoid going up too much initially, as the enemy could be a threat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2) first, since it's closer, and then decide whether to go for the apple at (7,8) or head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,2), I need to move right to (6,2), then (7,2), then (8,2). That's three moves: right, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself during these moves.\n\nGiven that I'm currently at (5,2), and I've just moved up from (5,1), which is my tail.\n\nAs I move right to (6,2), my tail will be at (5,2).\n\nThen, moving to (7,2), tail at (6,2).\n\nThen to (8,2), tail at (7,2).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on top of the enemy or my own body.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (9,1), which is at row 1, column 9, it's somewhat distant from my path to (8,2). Unless the enemy moves up and to the left, it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy's movements in the upcoming turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (6,2).\n\nThen, in the next turn, right to (7,2), then right to (8,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (8,2).\n\nThen, I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8): row 8, column 7\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\n- (0,4): row 0, column 4\n\n- (0,2): row 0, column 2\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, which might be risky because the enemy is at (9,1), which is up and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a long path and might take many turns, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, but that's in the opposite direction of my current path.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apples first, which are in the same general direction.\n\nSo, after (8,2), the closest apple is (7,8), which is up and to the left.\n\nFrom (8,2), I would need to move up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on, until I reach (7,8).\n\nBut this path might take me closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, I could head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5) and (0,4).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (0,5) directly.\n\nFrom (8,2), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1), then (7,0), then left to (6,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5).\n\nThis still seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving diagonally if possible, but in Snake, you can only move in straight lines, either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right, and you can't move diagonally.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close to each other, while the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are clustered at the bottom row.\n\nI could consider capturing the top cluster first and then moving down to the bottom cluster.\n\nBut I need to be careful about the enemy's position and movement.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy from certain paths while I collect apples.\n\nHowever, since this is a multi-apple Snake game, and the goal is to have the most points by the end, I should focus on maximizing the number of apples I collect while minimizing the risk of dying.\n\nGiven that, perhaps prioritizing the closer apples and planning a path that allows me to pick up as many as possible without exposing myself to the enemy is the way to go.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths again.\n\nStarting from (5,2):\n\n1. Move right to (6,2)\n\n2. Move right to (7,2)\n\n3.

That means moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the initial information, I'm currently at (5,4). Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (5,3), but in the latest board state, it's (5,4). I need to confirm that. Let's look again.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\n- Row 4: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . T . . . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (5,4), and its tail is at (5,3). Okay, got it.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,2)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,1) with body at [].\n\nSo, it's just the head at (9,1).\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are apples spread out in different areas: one in the top-right area, one in the top-middle, and three in the bottom row.\n\nI should consider the distance to each apple and the potential paths to get there, making sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (5,4).\n\n- Apple at (8,2): that's 3 right and 2 down.\n\n- Apple at (7,8): that's 2 right and 4 up.\n\n- Apples at (0,5), (0,4), (0,2): that's 5 down and then move left or right accordingly.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nFirst, I should consider the proximity of the apples. The apple at (8,2) is relatively close, only 3 steps right and 2 steps down.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is further away, requiring 2 steps right and 4 steps up.\n\nThe bottom row apples are even further, requiring 5 steps down and then moving horizontally.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for the closest apple first, which is (8,2).\n\nLet me map out a path to (8,2):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nThat's 3 rights and 2 downs.\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail follows and that I don't run into it.\n\nCurrently, my tail is at (5,3), since I'm at (5,4). As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming it's following the standard Snake mechanics.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves, and then each segment follows the one before it.\n\nBut in this game, it seems like the tail moves as you move, so I need to be careful not to move into your own tail.\n\nWait, looking back, in the last move information, it was mentioned that from (5,3), moving up to (5,4), the tail was at (5,2).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify: in Snake, when you move, the entire snake shifts in the direction you're moving, and the tail follows the path the head took previously.\n\nIn this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and as you move, the tail stays in place until the head moves past a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's body growing when it eats an apple and shrinking when it moves without eating.\n\nBut in this game, it's specified that when you eat an apple, you grow and gain a point, and if you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that as I move, I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan a path that avoids my own tail and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, my tail is at (5,3), and I'm at (5,4).\n\nIf I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (7,4), tail moves to (7,3).\n\nThen right to (8,4), tail to (8,3).\n\nThen down to (8,3), but wait, my tail is already there, so that would be a collision.\n\nWait, no, if I move down from (8,4) to (8,3), my tail was at (8,3), but since I just moved, the tail should move to (8,4).\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up in the snake's movement mechanics.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's head movement and assume that the body follows accordingly, as long as there's no self-collision.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body.\n\nSo, for the path to (8,2):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by my body or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, it seems safe to move in that direction.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left, while the others are down.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (7,8), I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, I might give the enemy an opportunity to go for (7,8).\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to group the apples that are closer together.\n\nThe apples at (8,2) and (7,8) are relatively close, while the bottom row apples are further away.\n\nAlternatively, going for the bottom row apples might be safer since they are clustered together, allowing me to collect multiple apples in one path.\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a longer path and might take more time, during which the enemy could capture other apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, then the bottom row apples.\n\nBut moving to (7,8) would require moving up from (8,2):\n\n- Left to (7,2)\n\n- Up to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- ...\n\n- Up to (7,8)\n\nThat seems like a longer path than going directly to the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), moving left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), and so on to (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, from (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then up to (7,4), and so on.\n\nEither way, it's a similar number of steps.\n\nI need to think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf I head towards (7,8), the enemy might try to intercept me or go for the bottom row apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down to the bottom row apples, the enemy might go for (7,8).\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, let's plan to go for (8,2), then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and so on to (0,0), then up to"

There's also an enemy snake at (9,1) with no body segments listed, so it's just the head.\n\nMy last move was up from (5,3) to (5,4), and my rationale was to head towards the closest apple at (8,2).\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move.\n\nLet me consider the positions again:\n\n- I'm at (5,4).\n\n- The apple at (8,2) is still the closest.\n\nTo get to (8,2) from (5,4), I need to move right three times and down two times.\n\nSo, from (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, I don't collide with my own tail or the enemy.\n\nCurrently, my tail is at (5,3). As I move right to (6,4), my tail will move to (6,3), assuming the standard Snake mechanics where the body follows the head.\n\nWait, in Snake, when you move, each segment of the body shifts forward, so the tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was, and so on.\n\nBut in this game, it seems that the snake has a head and a tail, and the body follows as you move, growing only when you eat an apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the path I take doesn't lead the head to a position where it would collide with the body or the tail.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4), (7,4), (8,4) are all empty.\n\n- (8,3) is empty.\n\n- (8,2) has an apple.\n\nSo, moving right to (6,4) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, moving right to (7,4), then to (8,4), then down to (8,3), and finally down to (8,2) should be okay, as long as the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,1). If it moves up, it would go to (9,2), which is where one of the apples is, but according to the board state, the apple at (9,2) is already eaten or not present.\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . A 1\n\nSo, there's an apple at (8,2) and the enemy at (9,1).\n\nSo, (9,2) might be empty or have an apple, but according to the list, apples are at (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4), (0,2). So, (9,2) doesn't have an apple.\n\nTherefore, the enemy at (9,1) might move up to (9,2), but there's no apple there, so it might not be beneficial for the enemy to go there.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy could move left or right.\n\nI need to anticipate the enemy's movements and plan accordingly.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path to (8,2):\n\n- Move right to (6,4)\n\n- Move right to (7,4)\n\n- Move right to (8,4)\n\n- Move down to (8,3)\n\n- Move down to (8,2)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move, my tail is not blocking my path.\n\nAfter each move, the tail follows the body segments, so as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause the tail to collide with the head, I should be fine.\n\nGiven that, moving right three times and then down twice should be a straight path without sharp turns.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the right, to (6,4).\n\nBut before I decide, let me think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (0,4)\n\n- (0,2)\n\nThe apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2) are all in row 0, which is at the bottom.\n\nThe apple at (7,8) is up and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's position and potential paths.\n\nIf I go for the apples in row 0 after (8,2), I'll need to move down from (8,2) to row 0, which is a considerable distance.\n\nDuring that time, the enemy could potentially move towards the apple at (7,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,8) after (8,2), I would need to move left to (7,4), then up to (7,8), which is also a distance.\n\nI need to balance between collecting apples quickly and avoiding the enemy.\n\nPerhaps the best strategy is to collect the closest apples first.\n\nGiven that, going to (8,2) and then to (7,8) might be efficient, but it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, going to (8,2) and then to the bottom row apples might be safer, as the bottom row has multiple apples clustered together.\n\nBut moving down from (8,2) to row 0 would require passing through potentially dangerous areas, depending on the enemy's movements.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (9,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nIf I move down towards row 0, I might be moving closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I head up towards (7,8), I might be moving away from the enemy, but it's also farther from the bottom row apples.\n\nI need to make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing apple collection.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (8,2), then head towards the bottom row apples, but stay aware of the enemy's position.\n\nGiven that, my immediate move should be to the right, towards (6,4).\n\nI need to confirm that this is a safe move.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,4) is empty.\n\n- My tail is at (5,3), which should move to (6,3) after I move to (6,4).\n\nThere's no collision with my tail or the enemy.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (6,4) is safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving right to (7,4), then to (8,4), then down to (8,3), and finally to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (8,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nGiven the potential risks of moving down towards the bottom row apples, where the enemy might be moving, perhaps it's better to go for the apple at (7,8) next.\n\nBut that would require moving left and up, which is a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, if I head down towards the bottom row apples, I might be able to collect multiple apples in one path, which would be more efficient.\n\nI need to weigh the risks.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with heading towards the bottom row apples after eating (8,2).\n\nSo, after eating (8,2), I can move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis path allows me to collect multiple apples in one direction, which is efficient.\n\nHowever, it's a long path, and I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy along the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (7,8) after (8,2), then head down to the bottom row apples.\n\nBut that would involve moving up and to the left, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps heading down to the bottom row apples is a safer bet.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then head down to (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), and continue left to (0,0).\n\n3. From there, move up to collect the apples at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2).\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nNow, focusing on the immediate move:\n\nI'm at (5,4), and I need to move right to (6,4).\n\nI need to confirm that this is safe.\n\n- (6,4) is empty.\n\n- My tail is at (5,3), which will move to (6,3).\n\nNo collision with my tail or the enemy."

The enemy snake is at position (6, 7) with its body part at (6, 6).\n\nMy strategy should be to move towards the closest apple to gain a point, while also maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. Going UP seems like the best move right now, as it will bring me closer to the apple at (0, 5) and keep me away from the enemy snake.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and keep an eye on the enemy snake's position, as moving UP will also bring me closer to it. If the enemy snake makes an unexpected move, I may need to adjust my strategy.\n\nFor the next turn, I will continue to monitor the enemy snake's movement and be ready to change my direction if necessary. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions with the enemy snake or the walls.\n\nMy next move: UP."

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make my next move in this Snake game. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and according to the latest board state, I'm currently at (6,7). Wait, in the previous information, it said I was at (6,7), but in the latest board state, it shows me at (6,7). Okay, that's consistent.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . 2 . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . T . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, 'T' is my tail, '2' is my head, 'A' are apples, and '1' is the enemy snake.\n\nFrom this, my head is at (6,7), which is row 7, column 6.\n\nApples are at (8,2), (7,8), (0,5), (0,4), (0,2).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,5) with body at [].\n\nSo, it's just the head at (9,5).\n\nI need to plan my path to collect these apples without colliding with the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple.\n\nI'm at (6,7), and the apples are at:\n\n- (8,2): That's 2 units down and 2 to the right.\n\n- (7,8): 1 unit up and 1 to the right.\n\n- (0,5): 7 units down.\n\n- (0,4): 7 units down and 1 to the left.\n\n- (0,2): 7 units down and 4 to the left.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be (7,8), which is only 1 unit up and 1 to the right.\n\nAlternatively, (8,2) is farther, requiring 2 units down and 2 to the right.\n\nConsidering the positions, perhaps (7,8) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (9,5), which is row 5, column 9.\n\nSo, to get to (7,8), I would need to move up to (6,8), then right to (7,8).\n\nWait, no, I'm at (6,7). To move up, y increases.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, y increases upwards.\n\nSo, from (6,7), up to (6,8), then right to (7,8).\n\nBut let's check if that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (6,7):\n\n- Up to (6,8): empty.\n\n- Right to (7,8): has an apple.\n\nSo, that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,2):\n\nFrom (6,7):\n\n- Down to (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), then right to (7,2), (8,2).\n\nThat's a longer path.\n\nGiven that, going for (7,8) first seems better.\n\nLet me think about the path in more detail.\n\nPath to (7,8):\n\n1. Up to (6,8)\n\n2. Right to (7,8)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,8), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can plan to go for another apple.\n\nAfter (7,8), perhaps I can head down towards (8,2).\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Down to (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), then right to (8,2).\n\nThat's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,8), right to (8,8), down to (8,7), (8,6), ..., (8,2).\n\nBut that seems even longer.\n\nPerhaps it's better to head down towards row 0 where there are multiple apples.\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Down to (7,7), (7,6), ..., (7,0), then left to (0,0), then up to (0,5), etc.\n\nThat's a very long path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (8,2) next.\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Right to (8,8), down to (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2).\n\nThat's a longer path.\n\nGiven that, perhaps after eating (7,8), I should head towards the apples in row 0.\n\nBut that would require moving down a lot, and the enemy might be a threat.\n\nWait, where is the enemy now?\n\nEnemy is at (9,5), which is row 5, column 9.\n\nIf I go to (7,8), the enemy would need to move up to (9,6), (9,7), etc., to approach me.\n\nBut since I'm higher up, it might take some time for the enemy to reach me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (7,8) first is safe.\n\nAfter eating (7,8), I need to decide the next move.\n\nLet me consider the possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Go for (8,2)\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Right to (8,8)\n\n- Down to (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)\n\nThat's 1 right + 6 down moves.\n\nOption 2: Go for (0,5)\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Down to (7,7), (7,6), ..., (7,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\n- Up to (0,5)\n\nThat's a longer path.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,2)\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Down to (7,7), (7,6), ..., (7,2)\n\nThat's shorter, but there's no apple at (7,2). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (8,2), not (7,2).\n\nWait, (8,2) is an apple.\n\nSo, from (7,8):\n\n- Down to (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)\n\n- Then right to (8,2)\n\nThat's 6 down moves and 1 right move.\n\nTotal of 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, right to (8,8), then down to (8,7), (8,6), ..., (8,2), which is 1 right and 6 down moves, same total.\n\nSo, either way, it's 7 moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for the apples in row 0 next, but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for the apple at (0,5) after (7,8).\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Down to (7,7), (7,6), ..., (7,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\n- Up to (0,5)\n\nThat's a longer path, but it allows me to collect multiple apples.\n\nHowever, it's a longer path, and I need to be careful not to run into the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (9,5). If it moves up, it can try to approach me, but it's slower.\n\nI can try to stay away from the enemy by moving upwards.\n\nBut the board has a top limit at y=9.\n\nWait, no, y=9 is the top row.\n\nI'm at y=8 after moving up from (6,7) to (6,8), then right to (7,8).\n\nAfter eating (7,8), I can decide to move down towards the apples in row 0, but that's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for (8,2) next.\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Right to (8,8)\n\n- Down to (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)\n\nThat's 1 right and 6 down moves.\n\nTotal of 7 moves.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I can then head towards the apples in row 0.\n\nBut that seems time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for the apple at (0,5) directly.\n\nFrom (7,8):\n\n- Down to (7,7), (7,6), ..., (7,0)\n\n-"
