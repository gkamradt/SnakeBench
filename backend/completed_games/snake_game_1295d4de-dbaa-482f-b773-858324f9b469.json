That apple is one step to the right.\n\u2022 If we move RIGHT, we would immediately eat the apple. However, that puts our head right at the board\u2019s edge (position (9,1)). Although eating an apple is great for points and growth, being on the extreme edge can sometimes trap you if things change unexpectedly.\n\u2022 Alternatively, if we move UP to (8,2), we remain more centrally located. We would miss the apple this turn, but we\u2019d keep our options open, giving us better maneuverability on future moves.\n\u2022 Considering that we want to avoid potential traps near the board edge and maintain flexibility\u2014as well as the fact that the enemy snake is distant\u2014we decide the safer, more versatile option is to move UP.\nThus, our chosen next move is: UP."
