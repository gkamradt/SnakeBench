The (5, 4) apple looks most strategically positioned\n2. I need to navigate carefully to reach it\n3. Enemy snake is currently not an immediate threat\n\nMovement Options:\n- UP: Would move to (7, 4)\n  - Brings me closer to (5, 4) apple\n  - Clear path\n  - No collision risks\n- RIGHT: Would move to (8, 3)\n  - Takes me away from target apple\n- LEFT: Would move to (6, 3)\n  - Backwards movement\n- DOWN: Would move to (7, 2)\n  - Takes me further from target apple\n\nStrategic Reasoning:\n- UP provides the best approach to the (5, 4) apple\n- Maintains good board positioning\n- Minimal risk of collision\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- Continue path towards (5, 4) apple\n- Monitor enemy snake movements\n- Maintain flexible positioning\n\nNext move decision:\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's analyze the current situation and plan the next move.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- **My Position**: (7, 5)\n- **Apples**: (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 7), (5, 4), (1, 4)\n- **Enemy Snake**: Snake #1 at (7, 3) with body at [(7, 2)]\n- **Board Size**: 10x10\n\n### Immediate Goals:\n1. **Avoid Collisions**: Don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n2. **Collect Apples**: Aim to grow and gain points.\n3. **Plan Ahead**: Think about the next moves to maximize points and safety.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves:\nFrom (7, 5), the possible moves are:\n- **UP**: To (7, 6)\n- **DOWN**: To (7, 4)\n- **LEFT**: To (6, 5)\n- **RIGHT**: To (8, 5)\n\n### Evaluating Each Move:\n1. **UP to (7, 6)**:\n   - **Pros**: Moves towards the top of the board.\n   - **Cons**: No immediate apple in this direction.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 4)**:\n   - **Pros**: Moves towards the apple at (5, 4).\n   - **Cons**: Need to check for collisions.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 5)**:\n   - **Pros**: Moves towards the center of the board.\n   - **Cons**: No immediate apple in this direction.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 5)**:\n   - **Pros**: Moves towards the edge of the board.\n   - **Cons**: No immediate apple in this direction.\n\n### Decision:\nThe apple at (5, 4) is the closest, so moving **DOWN** to (7, 4) is the optimal choice. This move positions me closer to the apple while avoiding immediate collisions.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter moving to (7, 4), I should reassess the board for the next closest apple and plan my moves accordingly, ensuring I avoid collisions.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**Move: DOWN**"
