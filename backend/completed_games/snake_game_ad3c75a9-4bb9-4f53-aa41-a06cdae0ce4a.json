This position allowed me to consume the apple at (2, 1), gaining a point and likely growing the snake by one segment.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**: Snake #2 remains at (8, 1) and is not near me, so it is not posing an immediate threat right now.\n\n3. **Current Apples**:\n   - Existing apples are located at positions: (8, 6), (9, 6), (3, 9), (0, 2).\n   - The apple at (0, 2) is the closest, as it is just two moves away to the left.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves:\n1. **Left (to (1, 1))**: This move would take me closer to the apple at (0, 2). It's a safe move as there's no immediate threat or boundary issue.\n\n2. **Right (to (3, 1))**: This move doesn't bring me closer to any apples and takes me away from the nearest apple.\n\n3. **Up (to (2, 2))**: Moving here doesn't align with the nearest apple goal, and it's also a previous position which doesn't offer immediate gain.\n\n4. **Down (to (2, 0))**: Would move away from the apples currently on the board.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis, the best move seems to be to move left towards the apple at (0, 2). This will position me better to collect the next apple with minimal moves and without immediate threats.\n\n### Decision for Next Move:\nMove **LEFT** to (1, 1).\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\n- Move towards the apple at (0, 2).\n- Continue monitoring enemy snake position to avoid confrontations.\n- Re-evaluate apple positions and enemy movements after reaching the apple at (0, 2).\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

The enemy snake is currently at (2, 1) with its body at (2, 2) and (2, 3). This means that the enemy snake is positioned in a way that could potentially block my path to the apple at (8, 0).\n\nGiven this situation, I have a few options to consider:\n\n1. Continue moving RIGHT towards the apple at (8, 0): This is the most straightforward approach, as it allows me to collect the apple. However, it also risks a potential collision with the enemy snake.\n\n2. Move LEFT to create some distance from the enemy snake: This could be a safer option, as it would put more space between my snake and the enemy snake. However, it would also mean missing out on the opportunity to collect the apple at (8, 0).\n\n3. Move UP or DOWN to reposition myself: This could be a good strategy to avoid a direct confrontation with the enemy snake while still keeping the apple at (8, 0) in sight.\n\nAfter carefully weighing the options, I believe the best course of action is to move UP. This will allow me to reposition myself and potentially find a better angle to approach the apple at (8, 0) without directly engaging the enemy snake.\n\nMy next move: UP\n\nNext turn, I'll assess the situation again and decide whether to continue moving UP, or potentially shift to a different direction to collect the apple or avoid the enemy snake."

Additionally, (3, 9) and (6, 4) offer other viable paths moving rightward.\n- **Enemy Snake (#2) Position**: Still at position (3, 2), no immediate threat to current movement paths.\n\n### Updated Movement Options and Evaluation:\n\n1. **UP to (0, 6)**\n   - **Analysis**: Progressing toward apples (8, 6) and (9, 6). Continuing upwards keeps clear from walls and enemy snake.\n   - **Risk**: Maintain awareness; should any threat evolve, a lateral shift might be required in the future.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0, 4)**\n   - **Analysis**: Retreats unnecessarily given current apple opportunities.\n   - **Risk**: No strategic advancement, merely backtracking.\n\n3. **LEFT**\n   - **Analysis**: Not feasible due to current left boundary (x=0).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (1, 5)**\n   - **Analysis**: Initiates a path toward the apple at (6, 4), deviates slightly from immediate vertical strategy but remains sensible for longer-term apple pursuit.\n   - **Risk**: Potential to get locked if enemy snake approaches unexpectedly.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n\n- **Continue Upward Movement**: Prioritize reaching apples at the top. The path is clear, ensuring no risk from walls or collisions.\n- **Re-evaluate After Next Move**: Keep track of the status of enemy snake #2 and apple locations. Adjust promptly if new risks emerge or apples become more accessible based on the board's dynamic shifts.\n\n### Strategy for Future Moves:\n\n- Observe the movement patterns of enemy snake #2.\n- Should apples (8, 6) and (9, 6) remain congested or risky, prepare to divert rightward for (6, 4).\n- Always keep at least two moves ahead for maximum strategic advantage.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: UP"
