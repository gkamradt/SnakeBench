After that, I can reassess based on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nThe apple at (8, 2) is still a viable secondary target if the enemy snake starts coming towards the center. For now, I'll stick to the plan of getting the apple at (4, 9).\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nMove UP again to get closer to the apple at (4, 9). Keep an eye on the enemy snake's position. If it starts coming down, be prepared to adjust the path or switch focus to the apple at (8, 2) if needed.\n\nNext move: UP"
