            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,0) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't immediately contribute to apple collection. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe.

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0).

No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2). So moving left towards (5,2) is safe. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take me back to (7,2). But my previous position was (7,2) before moving to (6,2). Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls.

From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (5,2) after moving left from (6,2) in the last move. The apples are at (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), and (7,3). The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't immediately contribute to apple collection. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (6, 2) now. The apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), and (2,2). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,0) with no body segments. The board shows that my last move was LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2). \n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2). So moving left towards (5,2) is safe. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take me back to (7,2). But my previous position was (7,2) before moving to (6,2). Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path.

My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left.

No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2).

Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Moving RIGHT would take me back to (5,2), which was my previous position. Since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved, so (5,2) is now empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,2) to the left and (7,3) to the right. Continuing left towards (2,2) would require moving to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. That's two more moves.

The apple at (7,3) requires moving up and right. \n\nSince the snake's goal is to collect apples without dying, the safest and most efficient path is to continue moving LEFT towards (2,2). This path is clear and requires fewer moves. \n\nCheck for any obstacles: (3,2) and (2,2) are both empty.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left.

My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), and (7,3). The enemy snake #1 is at (1,1) with a body part at (1,0). The board shows my snake at (4,2) now.\n\nPossible directions from (4,2) are LEFT (to 3,2), RIGHT (to 5,2), UP (to 4,3), or DOWN (to 4,1). \n\nFirst, check safety. Moving RIGHT would take me back to (5,2), which was my previous position. Since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved, so (5,2) is now empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,2) to the left and (7,3) to the right. Continuing left towards (2,2) would require moving to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. That's two more moves. Alternatively, moving right towards (5,2) and then up towards (7,3) could be another path. \n\nBut moving LEFT again would get me closer to (2,2). However, I need to ensure there's no collision. The path to (3,2) is clear. The enemy snake is at (1,1), which is still far. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (4,3) starts a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (4,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is three moves away if I go right, up, right. But moving RIGHT now to (5,2) and then UP to (5,3) might be a better path. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (5,2), which is safe. Then next move could be UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (4,2), moving UP to (4,3), then RIGHT to (5,3), etc. \n\nComparing the two paths, moving LEFT continues towards (2,2), which is closer. However, moving RIGHT might open up more options for future moves. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (2,2) is in the same row, so moving left is straightforward. The apple at (7,3) requires moving up and right. \n\nSince the snake's goal is to collect apples without dying, the safest and most efficient path is to continue moving LEFT towards (2,2). This path is clear and requires fewer moves. \n\nCheck for any obstacles: (3,2) and (2,2) are both empty. The enemy snake is not in this area. \n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (3,2) to get closer to the apple at (2,2).\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The apples at (2,5) and (1,6) are the closest (both 4 steps by Manhattan distance), so it makes sense to work toward one of them.\n\n\u2022 Moving UP from (0,3) would put our head at (0,4).

Let me check possible directions.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3) are UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nFirst, check safety. \n\nUP to (2,4): Is that spot safe? The board shows at y=4 (row 4), (2,4) is empty. So moving up is safe. Then next steps towards (2,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,2): That's where my tail was. Since I moved up last time, the tail might have moved. Wait, the board shows at (2,2) there's a 'T' (tail) from snake 2. So moving down to (2,2) would hit my own tail. But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left.

My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left.

No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Let me check possible directions.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3) are UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nFirst, check safety. \n\nUP to (2,4): Is that spot safe? The board shows at y=4 (row 4), (2,4) is empty. So moving up is safe. Then next steps towards (2,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,2): That's where my tail was.

But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left.

My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Then next move could be UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (4,2), moving UP to (4,3), then RIGHT to (5,3), etc. \n\nComparing the two paths, moving LEFT continues towards (2,2), which is closer. However, moving RIGHT might open up more options for future moves. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (2,2) is in the same row, so moving left is straightforward. The apple at (7,3) requires moving up and right. \n\nSince the snake's goal is to collect apples without dying, the safest and most efficient path is to continue moving LEFT towards (2,2). This path is clear and requires fewer moves. \n\nCheck for any obstacles: (3,2) and (2,2) are both empty. The enemy snake is not in this area. \n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (3,2) to get closer to the apple at (2,2).\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there.

But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple.

Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty. Moving LEFT here is safe. From (1,5), next move could go towards the apple at (1,6) by moving UP.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5): Empty space. Then could head towards (5,7) or (7,3) apples. But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better. Let's go UP to (2,6) to set up for the next apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5).

The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left.

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2).

Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1.

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving here would eat it, grow, and gain a point. But need to ensure it's not occupied by another snake. The board shows (2,5) as 'A' (apple), so it's safe. No snakes are reported there.\n\n- DOWN to (2,3): That's where my body was. Since I just moved UP to (2,4), the previous position (2,3) is part of my body now. If I move DOWN, I'd collide with my own body. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,4): Check the board. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,4), so (1,4) is adjacent. Wait, enemy snake's head is at (0,4), and their body is at (0,3) and (0,2). So (1,4) is empty. Moving LEFT to (1,4) is safe. From there, possible paths towards (1,6) apple.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4): The board shows this as empty. Safe. Could head towards (5,7) or (7,3) apples.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest is (2,5) directly UP. Eating that would be efficient. However, after eating, the snake's body grows, so the tail stays in place. But moving UP here is safe and gets a point.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,4). Their next move could be towards their possible apples, but they're not in our immediate path. \n\nIf I move UP to (2,5), I eat the apple. Then next turn, the body would be longer. But need to plan the next move after that. However, the immediate gain is a point, so it's worth it.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,4) could set up a path towards (1,6), which is two moves up and left. But that's two apples, but (1,6) is further. Moving RIGHT to (3,4) could lead towards (5,7) or (7,3), but those are further away.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. It's safe and gains a point immediately. \n\nCheck for any risks: No other snakes are near (2,5). The enemy snake is at (0,4), which is far enough. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to collect the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,5) with body parts at [(0,4), (0,3)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,5), and there's an apple at (2,7) which is two spaces up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,5) are UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), or RIGHT to (3,5).\n\nFirst, check safety:\n\n- UP to (2,6): That's empty. Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty. Moving LEFT here is safe. From (1,5), next move could go towards the apple at (1,6) by moving UP.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5): Empty space. Then could head towards (5,7) or (7,3) apples. But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better. Let's go UP to (2,6) to set up for the next apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (2,6) after moving UP last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (2,7), (1,6), (9,9). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6) with body parts at [(0,5), (0,4)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,6), and there's an apple at (2,7) directly above me. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,0) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5).

But from (7,2), moving left would get me closer to (2,2) which is at x=2. That's a few moves away. However, there's an apple at (0,2) as well. So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2).

So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (2, 2) now. The apples are at (2,5), (5,7), (7,3), (2,7), and (1,6). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The board shows at y=4 (row 4), (2,4) is empty. So moving up is safe. Then next steps towards (2,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,2): That's where my tail was. Since I moved up last time, the tail might have moved. Wait, the board shows at (2,2) there's a 'T' (tail) from snake 2. So moving down to (2,2) would hit my own tail. But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn.

The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5).

That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better.

Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6).

However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again.

If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

While it may delay immediately grabbing an apple, safety is a priority at this stage.\n\nSo, I'll decide on: UP."

          "2": {
            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (2,7) after moving UP last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,7) with body parts at [(0,6), (0,5)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) to the right and up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5).

The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left.

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So moving left towards (5,2) is safe. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take me back to (7,2). But my previous position was (7,2) before moving to (6,2). Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (5,2) after moving left from (6,2) in the last move. The apples are at (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), and (7,3). The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now.

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The apples at (2,5) and (1,6) are the closest (both 4 steps by Manhattan distance), so it makes sense to work toward one of them.\n\n\u2022 Moving UP from (0,3) would put our head at (0,4).

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at [(0,2), (1,2)]. The board shows that at (2,3), my head is there. Let me check possible directions.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3) are UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nFirst, check safety. \n\nUP to (2,4): Is that spot safe? The board shows at y=4 (row 4), (2,4) is empty. So moving up is safe. Then next steps towards (2,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,2): That's where my tail was. Since I moved up last time, the tail might have moved. Wait, the board shows at (2,2) there's a 'T' (tail) from snake 2. So moving down to (2,2) would hit my own tail. But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving here would eat it, grow, and gain a point. But need to ensure it's not occupied by another snake. The board shows (2,5) as 'A' (apple), so it's safe. No snakes are reported there.\n\n- DOWN to (2,3): That's where my body was. Since I just moved UP to (2,4), the previous position (2,3) is part of my body now.

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,5) with body parts at [(0,4), (0,3)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,5), and there's an apple at (2,7) which is two spaces up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,5) are UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), or RIGHT to (3,5).\n\nFirst, check safety:\n\n- UP to (2,6): That's empty. Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better. Let's go UP to (2,6) to set up for the next apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,7) with body parts at [(0,6), (0,5)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) to the right and up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (3,7) after moving RIGHT last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,8) with body parts at [(0,7), (0,6)]. The board shows my head at (3,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) two cells to the right. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (3,7) are UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), or RIGHT to (4,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (3,8):** The cell is empty. Safe to move. No immediate apple here, but moving up could help navigate towards other areas.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** The cell is empty. Safe. However, moving down might take me away from the apple at (5,7).\n\n- **LEFT (2,7):** The cell is part of my body? Wait, my snake's current position is (3,7), and the last move was RIGHT from (2,7). So the previous position was (2,7), which is now part of the body. Moving LEFT to (2,7) would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** Closer to the apple at (5,7). Next move could be RIGHT again to (5,7) to collect the apple. This is the most direct path to gain a point quickly.\n\n- **UP (3,8):** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Might need to plan a path towards other apples like (9,9) or (7,3) later.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** Safe but moves away from the nearest apple. However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down. But moving down here would require subsequent moves left, which might conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nCheck enemy positions: Snake #1 is at (0,8). Their possible moves are UP to (0,9), DOWN to (0,7), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (1,8), that's not in my current path. My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position. But for the current turn, focusing on securing the apple is key.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,7) to approach the apple at (5,7) safely.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path.

Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now.

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at [(0,2), (1,2)]. The board shows that at (2,3), my head is there. Let me check possible directions.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3) are UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nFirst, check safety. \n\nUP to (2,4): Is that spot safe? The board shows at y=4 (row 4), (2,4) is empty. So moving up is safe. Then next steps towards (2,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,2): That's where my tail was. Since I moved up last time, the tail might have moved. Wait, the board shows at (2,2) there's a 'T' (tail) from snake 2. So moving down to (2,2) would hit my own tail. But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving here would eat it, grow, and gain a point. But need to ensure it's not occupied by another snake. The board shows (2,5) as 'A' (apple), so it's safe. No snakes are reported there.\n\n- DOWN to (2,3): That's where my body was. Since I just moved UP to (2,4), the previous position (2,3) is part of my body now.

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,5) are UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), or RIGHT to (3,5).\n\nFirst, check safety:\n\n- UP to (2,6): That's empty. Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better.

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6) with body parts at [(0,5), (0,4)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,6), and there's an apple at (2,7) directly above me. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,7) with body parts at [(0,6), (0,5)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) to the right and up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,8) with body parts at [(0,7), (0,6)]. The board shows my head at (3,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) two cells to the right. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (3,7) are UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), or RIGHT to (4,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (3,8):** The cell is empty. Safe to move. No immediate apple here, but moving up could help navigate towards other areas.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** The cell is empty. Safe. However, moving down might take me away from the apple at (5,7).\n\n- **LEFT (2,7):** The cell is part of my body? Wait, my snake's current position is (3,7), and the last move was RIGHT from (2,7). So the previous position was (2,7), which is now part of the body. Moving LEFT to (2,7) would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** Closer to the apple at (5,7). Next move could be RIGHT again to (5,7) to collect the apple. This is the most direct path to gain a point quickly.\n\n- **UP (3,8):** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Might need to plan a path towards other apples like (9,9) or (7,3) later.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** Safe but moves away from the nearest apple. However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down. But moving down here would require subsequent moves left, which might conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nCheck enemy positions: Snake #1 is at (0,8). Their possible moves are UP to (0,9), DOWN to (0,7), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (1,8), that's not in my current path. My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position. But for the current turn, focusing on securing the apple is key.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,7) to approach the apple at (5,7) safely.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe.

So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,0) with no body segments. The board shows that my last move was LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2). \n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2). So moving left towards (5,2) is safe. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take me back to (7,2). But my previous position was (7,2) before moving to (6,2). Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before.

If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The apples at (2,5) and (1,6) are the closest (both 4 steps by Manhattan distance), so it makes sense to work toward one of them.\n\n\u2022 Moving UP from (0,3) would put our head at (0,4).

Let me check possible directions.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3) are UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nFirst, check safety. \n\nUP to (2,4): Is that spot safe? The board shows at y=4 (row 4), (2,4) is empty. So moving up is safe. Then next steps towards (2,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,2): That's where my tail was. Since I moved up last time, the tail might have moved. Wait, the board shows at (2,2) there's a 'T' (tail) from snake 2. So moving down to (2,2) would hit my own tail. But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better.

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (3,7) after moving RIGHT last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,8) with body parts at [(0,7), (0,6)]. The board shows my head at (3,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) two cells to the right. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (3,7) are UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), or RIGHT to (4,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (3,8):** The cell is empty. Safe to move. No immediate apple here, but moving up could help navigate towards other areas.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** The cell is empty. Safe. However, moving down might take me away from the apple at (5,7).\n\n- **LEFT (2,7):** The cell is part of my body? Wait, my snake's current position is (3,7), and the last move was RIGHT from (2,7). So the previous position was (2,7), which is now part of the body. Moving LEFT to (2,7) would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** Closer to the apple at (5,7). Next move could be RIGHT again to (5,7) to collect the apple. This is the most direct path to gain a point quickly.\n\n- **UP (3,8):** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Might need to plan a path towards other apples like (9,9) or (7,3) later.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** Safe but moves away from the nearest apple. However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down. But moving down here would require subsequent moves left, which might conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nCheck enemy positions: Snake #1 is at (0,8). Their possible moves are UP to (0,9), DOWN to (0,7), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (1,8), that's not in my current path. My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position. But for the current turn, focusing on securing the apple is key.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,7) to approach the apple at (5,7) safely.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,0) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't immediately contribute to apple collection. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2).

Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,2) to the left and (7,3) to the right.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5).

So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3).

But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves.

Moving here would eat it, grow, and gain a point. But need to ensure it's not occupied by another snake. The board shows (2,5) as 'A' (apple), so it's safe. No snakes are reported there.\n\n- DOWN to (2,3): That's where my body was. Since I just moved UP to (2,4), the previous position (2,3) is part of my body now. If I move DOWN, I'd collide with my own body. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,4): Check the board. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,4), so (1,4) is adjacent.

From there, possible paths towards (1,6) apple.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4): The board shows this as empty. Safe. Could head towards (5,7) or (7,3) apples.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest is (2,5) directly UP. Eating that would be efficient. However, after eating, the snake's body grows, so the tail stays in place.

Their next move could be towards their possible apples, but they're not in our immediate path. \n\nIf I move UP to (2,5), I eat the apple. Then next turn, the body would be longer.

Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better. Let's go UP to (2,6) to set up for the next apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6) with body parts at [(0,5), (0,4)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,6), and there's an apple at (2,7) directly above me. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position. But for the current turn, focusing on securing the apple is key.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,7) to approach the apple at (5,7) safely.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5, 7) after moving right last turn. The apples are at (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), and (1,9). The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

So moving up is safe.\n- DOWN (6,6): Row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T at (1,6), but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (5,7): My previous position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The closest apples are (7,3) and (9,5). \n\nFrom (6,7), moving RIGHT to (7,7) gets me closer to (9,5). Moving DOWN to (6,6) starts heading towards (7,3). Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves.

If I move DOWN to (6,6), next turn I can go right towards (7,6). \n\nSince both paths are safe, but moving RIGHT continues the current trajectory towards (9,5), which has another apple at (9,9) nearby, I'll choose RIGHT to maintain momentum towards that area.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,0) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left.

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2).

Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1.

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,5) with body parts at [(0,4), (0,3)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,5), and there's an apple at (2,7) which is two spaces up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,5) are UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), or RIGHT to (3,5).\n\nFirst, check safety:\n\n- UP to (2,6): That's empty. Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty. Moving LEFT here is safe. From (1,5), next move could go towards the apple at (1,6) by moving UP.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5): Empty space. Then could head towards (5,7) or (7,3) apples. But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better. Let's go UP to (2,6) to set up for the next apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6) with body parts at [(0,5), (0,4)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,6), and there's an apple at (2,7) directly above me. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The closest apple is (5,7), which is just one cell to the right. So moving right to (5,7) would get me that apple. But I need to check if that's safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the cell (5,7) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. The next cell after that would be (6,7), which is empty. But wait, after eating the apple, my snake will grow, so the tail will extend. But the immediate move to (5,7) is safe as there's no obstacle there.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,8) with body parts at [(0,8), (0,7)]. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or other areas. But their current position isn't directly in my path.\n\nPossible directions from (4,7) are UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7).\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n- **RIGHT (5,7):** Apple here. Moving here is safe and gains a point. After eating, the next move would need to avoid the new body part. But this turn, it's safe.\n\n- **LEFT (3,7):** That's where my body was last turn. Since I moved right from (3,7) to (4,7), the body part at (3,7) is still there. So moving left would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **UP (4,8):** Check the board. At row 8, column 4, is that empty? From the board state given, row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's head at (1,8) and some other parts. The cell (4,8) seems empty. So moving up is safe but doesn't get the apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (4,6):** The cell (4,6) is empty. Safe, but moves away from the apple.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (5,7) to eat the apple. No immediate threats there. Next turn, I'll have to plan a path to avoid colliding with my own body as it grows. But for now, securing the apple is the priority. \n\nAnother consideration: After eating the apple, the next move from (5,7) could be RIGHT to (6,7), UP to (5,8), or DOWN to (5,6). Need to check those cells next turn, but that's future planning. For this turn, RIGHT is the optimal move.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5, 7) after moving right last turn. The apples are at (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), and (1,9). The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple.

Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves.

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with its body parts at [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. The board shows that at row 7 (y=7), the positions (7,7) is me (marked as 2), and there are T's (maybe tails?) around. \n\nFirst, possible directions from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- UP: (7,8). Looking at the board, row 8 has a T at (1,8) and others are empty. (7,8) seems clear. But need to check if that's a valid move. Wait, the board's state for y=8 (row 8) shows a T at (1,8) and (0,8). So (7,8) should be empty. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (7,6). Row 6 has a T at (1,6) (enemy snake's body). But (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (6,7). My previous position? Wait, from the last move info, I was at (7,7) after moving right from (6,7). If my snake has eaten an apple last move, then the tail might have extended. Wait, the last move direction was RIGHT, so if I ate an apple, the tail would stay. However, the board shows that in row 7 (y=7), positions (7,7) is me, and there's a T at (7,7)? Wait, looking at the board:\n\nThe row 7 (y=7) is: . . . T T T T 2 . . which I think corresponds to x=0 to 9. So (7,7) is position x=7, y=7, which is where I am. The T's are at x=3,4,5,6. So moving LEFT to (6,7) would be x=6, y=7. In the board, (6,7) is part of the T's (since x=6 in row 7 is marked as T). So moving LEFT would hit a tail, which is my own body part. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,7). In row 7, x=8 is empty. So it's safe. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples are at (7,3) (down), (9,9) (up-right), (9,5) (right and down), (1,9) (far left up), (3,5) (left and down). \n\nFrom (7,7), the closest apples are (9,5) and (7,3). (9,5) is two steps right and two down. (7,3) is four steps down. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), that's closer to (9,5). Next moves could be RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), but need to check for walls. (9,7) is valid, but moving DOWN from there would get me closer. Alternatively, moving down from (8,7) towards (8,6), then further down towards (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) would start heading towards (7,3). Then further down each step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might not lead directly to an apple unless I go towards (9,9), but that's a long path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7): Right x2 to (9,7), then down y2. Total 4 moves. If apples are collected upon moving into them, then stepping on (9,5) would require moving there. But the path must avoid obstacles.\n\nPath to (7,3): From (7,7), down 4 times. But may need to maneuver around possible tails or enemies. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6) or right to (8,6). But moving left would risk entering tail areas? Wait, in row 6 (y=6), (1,6) is a T (enemy's body), but (6,6) would be empty. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), maybe moving down to (7,5), then left/right to approach (7,3). \n\nI need to choose the safest path. The enemy snake is at (2,6) with body around (1,6-8). So the left side might be more dangerous. Moving right might be safer. \n\nAlso, considering the apple at (9,9), which is a corner, but that's far. The apple at (9,5) is closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,5) from (7,7) would require going left, but that's blocked by my tail. So that's not feasible. \n\nSo the options are between RIGHT towards (9,5) or DOWN towards (7,3). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now to (8,7) gives more space, while moving DOWN might lead into areas with possible enemy movement. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) with body parts on (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). So their head is at (2,6), and they could move in any direction except into their own body. They might move towards apples, maybe (3,5) or others. But they are on the left side, so moving right might avoid them. \n\nIf I move RIGHT, that takes me away from the enemy. \n\nBut also, after moving RIGHT, if I continue RIGHT to (9,7), then down to (9,5), that's 3 steps (including picking up the apple). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. From the current board, (9,9) is an apple, and the rest of row 9 has an apple at (9,5) and (9,9). So moving to (9,7) is safe. Then down to (9,6), (9,5) would be possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) is safe, then to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) \u2014 three downs from (7,7). But need to check if those positions are safe. In the current board, (7,6), (7,5), etc., are empty. \n\nSo both paths are viable. Which is shorter? The path to (9,5) is 3 moves (right, right, down), but the apple is at (9,5). The path to (7,3) is 4 moves (down, down, down, down). Wait, from (7,7), down four times to (7,3). So the apple is there. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first and then down could be better. However, if I move right now, I can collect (9,5) in three moves, but if I go down, maybe I can get (7,3) in four. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving down first: from (7,7) to (7,6) (down), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). But each step needs to be valid. \n\nAlso, the apple at (9,9) is another option, but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake's potential movement. If they are moving towards apples on the left, perhaps (3,5), then the right side is safer. \n\nConsidering all this, moving RIGHT to (8,7) seems like a good step towards the (9,5) apple, which is closer. So that's the chosen direction. \n\nBut wait, need to ensure that the next move after RIGHT is possible. For example, after moving to (8,7), next move could be RIGHT to (9,7), then down. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT, maybe go down from (8,7) towards (8,6), etc. \n\nAnother possible strategy: move DOWN to (7,6), heading towards (7,3). Let's compare:\n\nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 next move options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again to (9,7) is possible, then down to (9,6), (9,5). That's two more moves. \n\nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 next move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving down each time. \n\nWhich apple is more accessible? (7,3) is directly below, but (9,5) is farther but perhaps a straighter path. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding collision with enemy. The enemy is at (2,6), which is far from the right side, so moving right is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is RIGHT towards (9,5).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,0) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't immediately contribute to apple collection. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,0) with no body segments. The board shows that my last move was LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2). \n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2). So moving left towards (5,2) is safe. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take me back to (7,2). But my previous position was (7,2) before moving to (6,2). Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now.

The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5).

So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving here would eat it, grow, and gain a point. But need to ensure it's not occupied by another snake. The board shows (2,5) as 'A' (apple), so it's safe. No snakes are reported there.\n\n- DOWN to (2,3): That's where my body was. Since I just moved UP to (2,4), the previous position (2,3) is part of my body now.

The closest is (2,5) directly UP. Eating that would be efficient. However, after eating, the snake's body grows, so the tail stays in place.

Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better. Let's go UP to (2,6) to set up for the next apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6) with body parts at [(0,5), (0,4)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,6), and there's an apple at (2,7) directly above me. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,8) with body parts at [(0,7), (0,6)]. The board shows my head at (3,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) two cells to the right. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (3,7) are UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), or RIGHT to (4,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (3,8):** The cell is empty. Safe to move. No immediate apple here, but moving up could help navigate towards other areas.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** The cell is empty. Safe. However, moving down might take me away from the apple at (5,7).\n\n- **LEFT (2,7):** The cell is part of my body? Wait, my snake's current position is (3,7), and the last move was RIGHT from (2,7). So the previous position was (2,7), which is now part of the body. Moving LEFT to (2,7) would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** Closer to the apple at (5,7). Next move could be RIGHT again to (5,7) to collect the apple. This is the most direct path to gain a point quickly.\n\n- **UP (3,8):** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Might need to plan a path towards other apples like (9,9) or (7,3) later.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** Safe but moves away from the nearest apple. However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down. But moving down here would require subsequent moves left, which might conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nCheck enemy positions: Snake #1 is at (0,8). Their possible moves are UP to (0,9), DOWN to (0,7), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (1,8), that's not in my current path. My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position. But for the current turn, focusing on securing the apple is key.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,7) to approach the apple at (5,7) safely.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5, 7) after moving right last turn. The apples are at (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), and (1,9). The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The options are UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), or RIGHT (7,7). \n\nLooking at the board state:\n- UP (6,8): The row 8 (y=8) has T's (tails?) at (1,8) and (0,8), but (6,8) is empty. So moving up is safe.\n- DOWN (6,6): Row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T at (1,6), but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (5,7): My previous position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The closest apples are (7,3) and (9,5). \n\nFrom (6,7), moving RIGHT to (7,7) gets me closer to (9,5). Moving DOWN to (6,6) starts heading towards (7,3). Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves. For (7,3): from (6,6), moving right to (7,6), then down three times. That's 4 moves as well. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now keeps me on a path that can reach both apples, while moving DOWN commits to (7,3). However, (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if I get trapped. \n\nAlso, enemy snake #1 is on the left, so the right side is safer. Moving RIGHT towards (9,5) seems viable. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (3,5) is in the middle. From (6,7), moving left isn't possible, but moving down and left could be a path. However, LEFT is blocked by my body. \n\nSo the best options are RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,7), next turn I can decide to go right again or down. If I move DOWN to (6,6), next turn I can go right towards (7,6). \n\nSince both paths are safe, but moving RIGHT continues the current trajectory towards (9,5), which has another apple at (9,9) nearby, I'll choose RIGHT to maintain momentum towards that area.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

          },
          "2": {
            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "Okay, let me assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (7,7). The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with its body parts at [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. The board shows that at row 7 (y=7), the positions (7,7) is me (marked as 2), and there are T's (maybe tails?) around. \n\nFirst, possible directions from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- UP: (7,8). Looking at the board, row 8 has a T at (1,8) and others are empty. (7,8) seems clear. But need to check if that's a valid move. Wait, the board's state for y=8 (row 8) shows a T at (1,8) and (0,8). So (7,8) should be empty. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (7,6). Row 6 has a T at (1,6) (enemy snake's body). But (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (6,7). My previous position? Wait, from the last move info, I was at (7,7) after moving right from (6,7). If my snake has eaten an apple last move, then the tail might have extended. Wait, the last move direction was RIGHT, so if I ate an apple, the tail would stay. However, the board shows that in row 7 (y=7), positions (7,7) is me, and there's a T at (7,7)? Wait, looking at the board:\n\nThe row 7 (y=7) is: . . . T T T T 2 . . which I think corresponds to x=0 to 9. So (7,7) is position x=7, y=7, which is where I am. The T's are at x=3,4,5,6. So moving LEFT to (6,7) would be x=6, y=7. In the board, (6,7) is part of the T's (since x=6 in row 7 is marked as T). So moving LEFT would hit a tail, which is my own body part. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,7). In row 7, x=8 is empty. So it's safe. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples are at (7,3) (down), (9,9) (up-right), (9,5) (right and down), (1,9) (far left up), (3,5) (left and down). \n\nFrom (7,7), the closest apples are (9,5) and (7,3). (9,5) is two steps right and two down. (7,3) is four steps down. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), that's closer to (9,5). Next moves could be RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), but need to check for walls. (9,7) is valid, but moving DOWN from there would get me closer. Alternatively, moving down from (8,7) towards (8,6), then further down towards (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) would start heading towards (7,3). Then further down each step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might not lead directly to an apple unless I go towards (9,9), but that's a long path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7): Right x2 to (9,7), then down y2. Total 4 moves. If apples are collected upon moving into them, then stepping on (9,5) would require moving there. But the path must avoid obstacles.\n\nPath to (7,3): From (7,7), down 4 times. But may need to maneuver around possible tails or enemies. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6) or right to (8,6). But moving left would risk entering tail areas? Wait, in row 6 (y=6), (1,6) is a T (enemy's body), but (6,6) would be empty. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), maybe moving down to (7,5), then left/right to approach (7,3). \n\nI need to choose the safest path. The enemy snake is at (2,6) with body around (1,6-8). So the left side might be more dangerous. Moving right might be safer. \n\nAlso, considering the apple at (9,9), which is a corner, but that's far. The apple at (9,5) is closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,5) from (7,7) would require going left, but that's blocked by my tail. So that's not feasible. \n\nSo the options are between RIGHT towards (9,5) or DOWN towards (7,3). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now to (8,7) gives more space, while moving DOWN might lead into areas with possible enemy movement. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) with body parts on (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). So their head is at (2,6), and they could move in any direction except into their own body. They might move towards apples, maybe (3,5) or others. But they are on the left side, so moving right might avoid them. \n\nIf I move RIGHT, that takes me away from the enemy. \n\nBut also, after moving RIGHT, if I continue RIGHT to (9,7), then down to (9,5), that's 3 steps (including picking up the apple). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. From the current board, (9,9) is an apple, and the rest of row 9 has an apple at (9,5) and (9,9). So moving to (9,7) is safe. Then down to (9,6), (9,5) would be possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) is safe, then to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) \u2014 three downs from (7,7). But need to check if those positions are safe. In the current board, (7,6), (7,5), etc., are empty. \n\nSo both paths are viable. Which is shorter? The path to (9,5) is 3 moves (right, right, down), but the apple is at (9,5). The path to (7,3) is 4 moves (down, down, down, down). Wait, from (7,7), down four times to (7,3). So the apple is there. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first and then down could be better. However, if I move right now, I can collect (9,5) in three moves, but if I go down, maybe I can get (7,3) in four. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving down first: from (7,7) to (7,6) (down), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). But each step needs to be valid. \n\nAlso, the apple at (9,9) is another option, but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake's potential movement. If they are moving towards apples on the left, perhaps (3,5), then the right side is safer. \n\nConsidering all this, moving RIGHT to (8,7) seems like a good step towards the (9,5) apple, which is closer. So that's the chosen direction. \n\nBut wait, need to ensure that the next move after RIGHT is possible. For example, after moving to (8,7), next move could be RIGHT to (9,7), then down. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT, maybe go down from (8,7) towards (8,6), etc. \n\nAnother possible strategy: move DOWN to (7,6), heading towards (7,3). Let's compare:\n\nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 next move options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again to (9,7) is possible, then down to (9,6), (9,5). That's two more moves. \n\nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 next move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving down each time. \n\nWhich apple is more accessible? (7,3) is directly below, but (9,5) is farther but perhaps a straighter path. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding collision with enemy. The enemy is at (2,6), which is far from the right side, so moving right is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is RIGHT towards (9,5).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (8,7) after moving right last turn. The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,5) with its body at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,7)]. The board shows that my position is at (8,7), and there are some T's around, which I assume are tails or body parts.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from (8,7). The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,8). Looking at the board, row 8 (y=8) seems mostly empty except for some T's at (1,8) and (0,8). (8,8) is empty, so this seems safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,6). Row 6 (y=6) has a T at (1,6) and (2,6) (enemy's head?), but (8,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,7). From the previous state, (7,7) was part of my body (marked as 2). But after moving right to (8,7), my tail might have shifted. Wait, the current board shows my snake at (8,7), so the previous position (7,7) might now be a tail. If I didn't eat an apple last move, moving left would go back into my tail. But did I eat an apple? Last move was from (7,7) to (8,7). If there was an apple at (8,7), I would have grown. But looking at the apples listed, (8,7) isn't an apple. So I didn't eat an apple, so my tail would have moved forward. Therefore, (7,7) is now part of my body. So moving LEFT to (7,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,7). The x=9 is within the board (since coordinates go up to 9). (9,7) is empty according to the board. Safe.\n\nSo possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? Let's look at the apples:\n\n- **(7,3)**: Down and left from (8,7). Requires moving down 4 times and left once. But moving left might not be safe next steps.\n- **(9,9)**: Up and right. From (8,7), moving up to (8,8), then right to (9,8), then up to (9,9). That's three moves. But (9,9) is a corner, so once there, I need to make sure I can turn without hitting walls.\n- **(9,5)**: Right and down. From (8,7), moving right to (9,7), then down to (9,6), (9,5). Two moves after RIGHT. This seems quick.\n- **(1,9)**: Far left and up. That's a long path, probably not the best option.\n- **(3,5)**: Left and down. But moving left from (8,7) is blocked by my own body, so that path is not feasible.\n\nThe closest apples are (9,5) and (9,9). Let's prioritize these. Moving RIGHT to (9,7) gets me closer to both (9,5) and (9,9). From (9,7), I can go down towards (9,5) or up towards (9,9). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,8) starts heading towards (9,9), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN to (8,6) could lead towards (7,3), but that's further away.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake positions. The enemy is at (2,5) with body parts around. They are on the left side, so moving right towards (9,5) or (9,9) keeps me away from them, reducing collision risk.\n\nAlso, the apple at (9,5) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. That's efficient. The apple at (9,9) is three moves away. Since (9,5) is closer, I should aim for that first.\n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (9,7), the next move would be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). Both steps need to be safe. Checking the board, (9,6) and (9,5) are currently empty. The enemy snake is far away, so those positions should remain safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6) starts heading towards (7,3), but that's a longer path. However, if (9,5) is taken by another snake, but in this case, there's only one enemy snake, and they are on the left side. So (9,5) is likely safe.\n\nAnother risk: moving RIGHT to (9,7) is at the edge. If I go there, next moves have limited options. For example, from (9,7), I can only go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. But since I need to go DOWN to reach (9,5), that's manageable.\n\nConsidering all this, the best move is RIGHT towards (9,5). This path is short and avoids the enemy. \n\nWait, but what if there's a tail or obstacle at (9,7)? The current board shows row 7 (y=7) as having T's from x=3 to x=6, and my position at x=8. So (9,7) is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nSo the decision is to move RIGHT to (9,7), then proceed down towards the apple. Therefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path.

My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left.

No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there.

But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple.

So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe.

Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn.

The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5).

That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better.

We thus delay the apple grab in favor of safety\u2014a good strategy early on when conflict is possible.\n\nSo our decided next move is: UP."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (2,6) after moving UP last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (2,7), (1,6), (9,9). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6) with body parts at [(0,5), (0,4)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,6), and there's an apple at (2,7) directly above me. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (2,7) after moving UP last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,7) with body parts at [(0,6), (0,5)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) to the right and up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down.

This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy.

The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)].

However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3).

From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,6) with body parts at [(1,7), (1,8), (0,8)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (6,7). The options are UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), or RIGHT (7,7). \n\nLooking at the board state:\n- UP (6,8): The row 8 (y=8) has T's (tails?) at (1,8) and (0,8), but (6,8) is empty. So moving up is safe.\n- DOWN (6,6): Row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T at (1,6), but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (5,7): My previous position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The closest apples are (7,3) and (9,5). \n\nFrom (6,7), moving RIGHT to (7,7) gets me closer to (9,5). Moving DOWN to (6,6) starts heading towards (7,3). Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves.

That's 4 moves as well. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now keeps me on a path that can reach both apples, while moving DOWN commits to (7,3). However, (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if I get trapped. \n\nAlso, enemy snake #1 is on the left, so the right side is safer. Moving RIGHT towards (9,5) seems viable. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (3,5) is in the middle. From (6,7), moving left isn't possible, but moving down and left could be a path. However, LEFT is blocked by my body. \n\nSo the best options are RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,7), next turn I can decide to go right again or down. If I move DOWN to (6,6), next turn I can go right towards (7,6). \n\nSince both paths are safe, but moving RIGHT continues the current trajectory towards (9,5), which has another apple at (9,9) nearby, I'll choose RIGHT to maintain momentum towards that area.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "Okay, let me assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (7,7). The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with its body parts at [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. The board shows that at row 7 (y=7), the positions (7,7) is me (marked as 2), and there are T's (maybe tails?) around. \n\nFirst, possible directions from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- UP: (7,8). Looking at the board, row 8 has a T at (1,8) and others are empty. (7,8) seems clear. But need to check if that's a valid move. Wait, the board's state for y=8 (row 8) shows a T at (1,8) and (0,8). So (7,8) should be empty. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (7,6). Row 6 has a T at (1,6) (enemy snake's body). But (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (6,7). My previous position? Wait, from the last move info, I was at (7,7) after moving right from (6,7). If my snake has eaten an apple last move, then the tail might have extended. Wait, the last move direction was RIGHT, so if I ate an apple, the tail would stay. However, the board shows that in row 7 (y=7), positions (7,7) is me, and there's a T at (7,7)? Wait, looking at the board:\n\nThe row 7 (y=7) is: . . . T T T T 2 . . which I think corresponds to x=0 to 9. So (7,7) is position x=7, y=7, which is where I am. The T's are at x=3,4,5,6. So moving LEFT to (6,7) would be x=6, y=7. In the board, (6,7) is part of the T's (since x=6 in row 7 is marked as T). So moving LEFT would hit a tail, which is my own body part. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,7). In row 7, x=8 is empty. So it's safe. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples are at (7,3) (down), (9,9) (up-right), (9,5) (right and down), (1,9) (far left up), (3,5) (left and down). \n\nFrom (7,7), the closest apples are (9,5) and (7,3). (9,5) is two steps right and two down. (7,3) is four steps down. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), that's closer to (9,5). Next moves could be RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), but need to check for walls. (9,7) is valid, but moving DOWN from there would get me closer. Alternatively, moving down from (8,7) towards (8,6), then further down towards (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) would start heading towards (7,3). Then further down each step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might not lead directly to an apple unless I go towards (9,9), but that's a long path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7): Right x2 to (9,7), then down y2. Total 4 moves. If apples are collected upon moving into them, then stepping on (9,5) would require moving there. But the path must avoid obstacles.\n\nPath to (7,3): From (7,7), down 4 times. But may need to maneuver around possible tails or enemies. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6) or right to (8,6). But moving left would risk entering tail areas? Wait, in row 6 (y=6), (1,6) is a T (enemy's body), but (6,6) would be empty. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), maybe moving down to (7,5), then left/right to approach (7,3). \n\nI need to choose the safest path. The enemy snake is at (2,6) with body around (1,6-8). So the left side might be more dangerous. Moving right might be safer. \n\nAlso, considering the apple at (9,9), which is a corner, but that's far. The apple at (9,5) is closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,5) from (7,7) would require going left, but that's blocked by my tail. So that's not feasible. \n\nSo the options are between RIGHT towards (9,5) or DOWN towards (7,3). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now to (8,7) gives more space, while moving DOWN might lead into areas with possible enemy movement. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) with body parts on (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). So their head is at (2,6), and they could move in any direction except into their own body. They might move towards apples, maybe (3,5) or others. But they are on the left side, so moving right might avoid them. \n\nIf I move RIGHT, that takes me away from the enemy. \n\nBut also, after moving RIGHT, if I continue RIGHT to (9,7), then down to (9,5), that's 3 steps (including picking up the apple). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. From the current board, (9,9) is an apple, and the rest of row 9 has an apple at (9,5) and (9,9). So moving to (9,7) is safe. Then down to (9,6), (9,5) would be possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) is safe, then to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) \u2014 three downs from (7,7). But need to check if those positions are safe. In the current board, (7,6), (7,5), etc., are empty. \n\nSo both paths are viable. Which is shorter? The path to (9,5) is 3 moves (right, right, down), but the apple is at (9,5). The path to (7,3) is 4 moves (down, down, down, down). Wait, from (7,7), down four times to (7,3). So the apple is there. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first and then down could be better. However, if I move right now, I can collect (9,5) in three moves, but if I go down, maybe I can get (7,3) in four. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving down first: from (7,7) to (7,6) (down), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). But each step needs to be valid. \n\nAlso, the apple at (9,9) is another option, but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake's potential movement. If they are moving towards apples on the left, perhaps (3,5), then the right side is safer. \n\nConsidering all this, moving RIGHT to (8,7) seems like a good step towards the (9,5) apple, which is closer. So that's the chosen direction. \n\nBut wait, need to ensure that the next move after RIGHT is possible. For example, after moving to (8,7), next move could be RIGHT to (9,7), then down. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT, maybe go down from (8,7) towards (8,6), etc. \n\nAnother possible strategy: move DOWN to (7,6), heading towards (7,3). Let's compare:\n\nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 next move options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again to (9,7) is possible, then down to (9,6), (9,5). That's two more moves. \n\nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 next move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving down each time. \n\nWhich apple is more accessible? (7,3) is directly below, but (9,5) is farther but perhaps a straighter path. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding collision with enemy. The enemy is at (2,6), which is far from the right side, so moving right is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is RIGHT towards (9,5).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The board shows that my position is at (8,7), and there are some T's around, which I assume are tails or body parts.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from (8,7). The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,8). Looking at the board, row 8 (y=8) seems mostly empty except for some T's at (1,8) and (0,8). (8,8) is empty, so this seems safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,6). Row 6 (y=6) has a T at (1,6) and (2,6) (enemy's head?), but (8,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,7). From the previous state, (7,7) was part of my body (marked as 2). But after moving right to (8,7), my tail might have shifted. Wait, the current board shows my snake at (8,7), so the previous position (7,7) might now be a tail. If I didn't eat an apple last move, moving left would go back into my tail. But did I eat an apple? Last move was from (7,7) to (8,7). If there was an apple at (8,7), I would have grown. But looking at the apples listed, (8,7) isn't an apple. So I didn't eat an apple, so my tail would have moved forward. Therefore, (7,7) is now part of my body. So moving LEFT to (7,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,7). The x=9 is within the board (since coordinates go up to 9). (9,7) is empty according to the board. Safe.\n\nSo possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? Let's look at the apples:\n\n- **(7,3)**: Down and left from (8,7). Requires moving down 4 times and left once. But moving left might not be safe next steps.\n- **(9,9)**: Up and right. From (8,7), moving up to (8,8), then right to (9,8), then up to (9,9). That's three moves. But (9,9) is a corner, so once there, I need to make sure I can turn without hitting walls.\n- **(9,5)**: Right and down. From (8,7), moving right to (9,7), then down to (9,6), (9,5). Two moves after RIGHT. This seems quick.\n- **(1,9)**: Far left and up. That's a long path, probably not the best option.\n- **(3,5)**: Left and down. But moving left from (8,7) is blocked by my own body, so that path is not feasible.\n\nThe closest apples are (9,5) and (9,9). Let's prioritize these. Moving RIGHT to (9,7) gets me closer to both (9,5) and (9,9). From (9,7), I can go down towards (9,5) or up towards (9,9). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,8) starts heading towards (9,9), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN to (8,6) could lead towards (7,3), but that's further away.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake positions. The enemy is at (2,5) with body parts around. They are on the left side, so moving right towards (9,5) or (9,9) keeps me away from them, reducing collision risk.\n\nAlso, the apple at (9,5) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. That's efficient. The apple at (9,9) is three moves away. Since (9,5) is closer, I should aim for that first.\n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (9,7), the next move would be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). Both steps need to be safe. Checking the board, (9,6) and (9,5) are currently empty. The enemy snake is far away, so those positions should remain safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6) starts heading towards (7,3), but that's a longer path. However, if (9,5) is taken by another snake, but in this case, there's only one enemy snake, and they are on the left side. So (9,5) is likely safe.\n\nAnother risk: moving RIGHT to (9,7) is at the edge. If I go there, next moves have limited options. For example, from (9,7), I can only go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. But since I need to go DOWN to reach (9,5), that's manageable.\n\nConsidering all this, the best move is RIGHT towards (9,5). This path is short and avoids the enemy. \n\nWait, but what if there's a tail or obstacle at (9,7)? The current board shows row 7 (y=7) as having T's from x=3 to x=6, and my position at x=8. So (9,7) is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nSo the decision is to move RIGHT to (9,7), then proceed down towards the apple. Therefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Our snake (\u201c1\u201d) now has its head at (3,5) (it just moved RIGHT from (2,5) to collect the apple at (3,5)) and its body occupies the nearby cells (including (2,5); see row 5). The remaining apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (5,4). Calculating Manhattan distances from (3,5):\n\n\u2022 (7,3) \u2192 4 + 2 = 6  \n\u2022 (9,9) \u2192 6 + 4 = 10  \n\u2022 (9,5) \u2192 6 + 0 = 6  \n\u2022 (1,9) \u2192 2 + 4 = 6  \n\u2022 (5,4) \u2192 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is the closest.\n\nFrom our head at (3,5), our possible moves (avoiding collisions) are:\n\u2013 UP to (3,6): safe (empty).\n\u2013 DOWN to (3,4): safe (empty).\n\u2013 RIGHT to (4,5): safe (empty).\n\u2013 LEFT to (2,5): not safe (our own body).\n\nSince the apple (5,4) is two steps to the right and one step down from us, heading toward it is best.

After moving RIGHT to (4,5), we can then adjust our vertical direction (likely moving DOWN) to approach the apple at (5,4).\n\nThus, considering both safety and proximity to the nearest apple, my decided next move is: RIGHT."

The enemy snake #1 is at (3,5) with a body that might be moving. The board shows my position at (9,7), and the previous move was RIGHT from (8,7) to (9,7).\n\nFirst, check possible directions from (9,7):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,8). The board shows row 8 (y=8) as mostly empty. (9,8) is safe.\n- **DOWN**: To (9,6). The board at (9,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (8,7). This was my previous position. Since I moved right last turn, my tail would have moved, so (8,7) might now be part of my body. Wait, if I didn't eat an apple last move, moving right would mean my tail moves forward. The last move was from (8,7) to (9,7). Since there's no apple at (9,7), my snake didn't grow. So the tail would have moved, making (8,7) part of the body. Therefore, moving LEFT to (8,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Can't move right since x=9 is the maximum. So RIGHT is invalid (wall).\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN. LEFT is unsafe, RIGHT is a wall.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards apples? The closest apples are (9,9) and (9,5). \n\n- **UP** towards (9,8) gets closer to (9,9). From (9,8), next move UP to (9,9) would collect the apple. But need to check if (9,8) is safe. The board shows (9,8) as empty. So moving UP is a good path to (9,9).\n\n- **DOWN** towards (9,6) gets closer to (9,5). From (9,6), next move DOWN to (9,5) would collect that apple. (9,5) is an apple, so that's a valid path.\n\nWhich apple is better? (9,9) is two moves away (UP then UP), and (9,5) is two moves away (DOWN then DOWN). Both are equally distant. However, after collecting (9,9), the next move would be into a corner, which might limit options. Collecting (9,5) leaves more space to maneuver. \n\nAlso, considering the enemy snake at (3,5), moving towards (9,5) is safe as they are far away. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving UP to (9,8), the next move to (9,9) would require turning, but since that's the edge, after eating the apple, the snake would need to turn left or right. But since (9,9) is a corner, moving left from there would be into (8,9), which is empty. However, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail extends. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) then DOWN to (9,5) allows for possible continuation to the left towards other apples like (7,3) or (5,4). \n\nAnother point: the apple at (9,9) is in the top-right corner. If I go there, after eating, I have to move left or down. But moving left from (9,9) would be (8,9), which is empty. \n\nHmm. Both options are viable. Let's check the board again. The apple at (9,9) is present, and (9,5) is also present. \n\nSince both are two moves away, perhaps prioritize the one that allows more flexibility after collection. Moving towards (9,5) might be better because after eating, moving left towards (8,5) could lead to the apple at (5,4) next. Alternatively, moving towards (9,9) would require moving left along the top edge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,5) is safer because the enemy snake is on the left side, so staying on the right edge might be safer. \n\nGiven that, I think moving DOWN towards (9,5) is the better option. So the next move should be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN again to (9,5) to eat the apple. \n\nTherefore, the direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path.

The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,0) with no body segments. The board shows that my last move was LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2). \n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2). So moving left towards (5,2) is safe. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take me back to (7,2). But my previous position was (7,2) before moving to (6,2). Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer.

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at [(0,2), (1,2)]. The board shows that at (2,3), my head is there. Let me check possible directions.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3) are UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nFirst, check safety. \n\nUP to (2,4): Is that spot safe? The board shows at y=4 (row 4), (2,4) is empty. So moving up is safe. Then next steps towards (2,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,2): That's where my tail was. Since I moved up last time, the tail might have moved. Wait, the board shows at (2,2) there's a 'T' (tail) from snake 2. So moving down to (2,2) would hit my own tail. But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better.

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7).

If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (3,7) after moving RIGHT last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,8) with body parts at [(0,7), (0,6)]. The board shows my head at (3,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) two cells to the right. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (3,7) are UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), or RIGHT to (4,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (3,8):** The cell is empty. Safe to move. No immediate apple here, but moving up could help navigate towards other areas.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** The cell is empty. Safe. However, moving down might take me away from the apple at (5,7).\n\n- **LEFT (2,7):** The cell is part of my body? Wait, my snake's current position is (3,7), and the last move was RIGHT from (2,7). So the previous position was (2,7), which is now part of the body. Moving LEFT to (2,7) would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** Closer to the apple at (5,7). Next move could be RIGHT again to (5,7) to collect the apple. This is the most direct path to gain a point quickly.\n\n- **UP (3,8):** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Might need to plan a path towards other apples like (9,9) or (7,3) later.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** Safe but moves away from the nearest apple. However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down. But moving down here would require subsequent moves left, which might conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nCheck enemy positions: Snake #1 is at (0,8). Their possible moves are UP to (0,9), DOWN to (0,7), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (1,8), that's not in my current path. My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position. But for the current turn, focusing on securing the apple is key.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,7) to approach the apple at (5,7) safely.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,6) with body parts at [(1,7), (1,8), (0,8)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (6,7). The options are UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), or RIGHT (7,7). \n\nLooking at the board state:\n- UP (6,8): The row 8 (y=8) has T's (tails?) at (1,8) and (0,8), but (6,8) is empty. So moving up is safe.\n- DOWN (6,6): Row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T at (1,6), but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (5,7): My previous position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The closest apples are (7,3) and (9,5). \n\nFrom (6,7), moving RIGHT to (7,7) gets me closer to (9,5). Moving DOWN to (6,6) starts heading towards (7,3). Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves. For (7,3): from (6,6), moving right to (7,6), then down three times. That's 4 moves as well. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now keeps me on a path that can reach both apples, while moving DOWN commits to (7,3). However, (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if I get trapped. \n\nAlso, enemy snake #1 is on the left, so the right side is safer.

If I move DOWN to (6,6), next turn I can go right towards (7,6). \n\nSince both paths are safe, but moving RIGHT continues the current trajectory towards (9,5), which has another apple at (9,9) nearby, I'll choose RIGHT to maintain momentum towards that area.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "Okay, let me assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (7,7). The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with its body parts at [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. The board shows that at row 7 (y=7), the positions (7,7) is me (marked as 2), and there are T's (maybe tails?) around. \n\nFirst, possible directions from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- UP: (7,8). Looking at the board, row 8 has a T at (1,8) and others are empty. (7,8) seems clear. But need to check if that's a valid move. Wait, the board's state for y=8 (row 8) shows a T at (1,8) and (0,8). So (7,8) should be empty. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (7,6). Row 6 has a T at (1,6) (enemy snake's body). But (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (6,7). My previous position? Wait, from the last move info, I was at (7,7) after moving right from (6,7). If my snake has eaten an apple last move, then the tail might have extended. Wait, the last move direction was RIGHT, so if I ate an apple, the tail would stay. However, the board shows that in row 7 (y=7), positions (7,7) is me, and there's a T at (7,7)? Wait, looking at the board:\n\nThe row 7 (y=7) is: . . . T T T T 2 . . which I think corresponds to x=0 to 9. So (7,7) is position x=7, y=7, which is where I am. The T's are at x=3,4,5,6. So moving LEFT to (6,7) would be x=6, y=7. In the board, (6,7) is part of the T's (since x=6 in row 7 is marked as T). So moving LEFT would hit a tail, which is my own body part. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,7). In row 7, x=8 is empty. So it's safe. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples are at (7,3) (down), (9,9) (up-right), (9,5) (right and down), (1,9) (far left up), (3,5) (left and down). \n\nFrom (7,7), the closest apples are (9,5) and (7,3). (9,5) is two steps right and two down. (7,3) is four steps down. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), that's closer to (9,5). Next moves could be RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), but need to check for walls. (9,7) is valid, but moving DOWN from there would get me closer. Alternatively, moving down from (8,7) towards (8,6), then further down towards (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) would start heading towards (7,3). Then further down each step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might not lead directly to an apple unless I go towards (9,9), but that's a long path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7): Right x2 to (9,7), then down y2. Total 4 moves. If apples are collected upon moving into them, then stepping on (9,5) would require moving there. But the path must avoid obstacles.\n\nPath to (7,3): From (7,7), down 4 times. But may need to maneuver around possible tails or enemies. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6) or right to (8,6). But moving left would risk entering tail areas? Wait, in row 6 (y=6), (1,6) is a T (enemy's body), but (6,6) would be empty. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), maybe moving down to (7,5), then left/right to approach (7,3). \n\nI need to choose the safest path. The enemy snake is at (2,6) with body around (1,6-8). So the left side might be more dangerous. Moving right might be safer. \n\nAlso, considering the apple at (9,9), which is a corner, but that's far. The apple at (9,5) is closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,5) from (7,7) would require going left, but that's blocked by my tail. So that's not feasible. \n\nSo the options are between RIGHT towards (9,5) or DOWN towards (7,3). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now to (8,7) gives more space, while moving DOWN might lead into areas with possible enemy movement. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) with body parts on (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). So their head is at (2,6), and they could move in any direction except into their own body. They might move towards apples, maybe (3,5) or others. But they are on the left side, so moving right might avoid them. \n\nIf I move RIGHT, that takes me away from the enemy. \n\nBut also, after moving RIGHT, if I continue RIGHT to (9,7), then down to (9,5), that's 3 steps (including picking up the apple). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. From the current board, (9,9) is an apple, and the rest of row 9 has an apple at (9,5) and (9,9). So moving to (9,7) is safe. Then down to (9,6), (9,5) would be possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) is safe, then to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) \u2014 three downs from (7,7). But need to check if those positions are safe. In the current board, (7,6), (7,5), etc., are empty. \n\nSo both paths are viable. Which is shorter? The path to (9,5) is 3 moves (right, right, down), but the apple is at (9,5). The path to (7,3) is 4 moves (down, down, down, down). Wait, from (7,7), down four times to (7,3). So the apple is there. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first and then down could be better. However, if I move right now, I can collect (9,5) in three moves, but if I go down, maybe I can get (7,3) in four. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving down first: from (7,7) to (7,6) (down), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). But each step needs to be valid. \n\nAlso, the apple at (9,9) is another option, but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake's potential movement. If they are moving towards apples on the left, perhaps (3,5), then the right side is safer. \n\nConsidering all this, moving RIGHT to (8,7) seems like a good step towards the (9,5) apple, which is closer. So that's the chosen direction. \n\nBut wait, need to ensure that the next move after RIGHT is possible. For example, after moving to (8,7), next move could be RIGHT to (9,7), then down. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT, maybe go down from (8,7) towards (8,6), etc. \n\nAnother possible strategy: move DOWN to (7,6), heading towards (7,3). Let's compare:\n\nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 next move options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again to (9,7) is possible, then down to (9,6), (9,5). That's two more moves. \n\nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 next move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving down each time. \n\nWhich apple is more accessible? (7,3) is directly below, but (9,5) is farther but perhaps a straighter path. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding collision with enemy. The enemy is at (2,6), which is far from the right side, so moving right is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is RIGHT towards (9,5).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,5) with its body at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,7)]. The board shows that my position is at (8,7), and there are some T's around, which I assume are tails or body parts.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from (8,7). The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,8). Looking at the board, row 8 (y=8) seems mostly empty except for some T's at (1,8) and (0,8). (8,8) is empty, so this seems safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,6). Row 6 (y=6) has a T at (1,6) and (2,6) (enemy's head?), but (8,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,7). From the previous state, (7,7) was part of my body (marked as 2). But after moving right to (8,7), my tail might have shifted. Wait, the current board shows my snake at (8,7), so the previous position (7,7) might now be a tail. If I didn't eat an apple last move, moving left would go back into my tail. But did I eat an apple? Last move was from (7,7) to (8,7). If there was an apple at (8,7), I would have grown. But looking at the apples listed, (8,7) isn't an apple. So I didn't eat an apple, so my tail would have moved forward. Therefore, (7,7) is now part of my body. So moving LEFT to (7,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,7). The x=9 is within the board (since coordinates go up to 9). (9,7) is empty according to the board. Safe.\n\nSo possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? Let's look at the apples:\n\n- **(7,3)**: Down and left from (8,7). Requires moving down 4 times and left once. But moving left might not be safe next steps.\n- **(9,9)**: Up and right. From (8,7), moving up to (8,8), then right to (9,8), then up to (9,9). That's three moves. But (9,9) is a corner, so once there, I need to make sure I can turn without hitting walls.\n- **(9,5)**: Right and down. From (8,7), moving right to (9,7), then down to (9,6), (9,5). Two moves after RIGHT. This seems quick.\n- **(1,9)**: Far left and up. That's a long path, probably not the best option.\n- **(3,5)**: Left and down. But moving left from (8,7) is blocked by my own body, so that path is not feasible.\n\nThe closest apples are (9,5) and (9,9). Let's prioritize these. Moving RIGHT to (9,7) gets me closer to both (9,5) and (9,9). From (9,7), I can go down towards (9,5) or up towards (9,9). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,8) starts heading towards (9,9), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN to (8,6) could lead towards (7,3), but that's further away.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake positions. The enemy is at (2,5) with body parts around. They are on the left side, so moving right towards (9,5) or (9,9) keeps me away from them, reducing collision risk.\n\nAlso, the apple at (9,5) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. That's efficient. The apple at (9,9) is three moves away. Since (9,5) is closer, I should aim for that first.\n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (9,7), the next move would be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). Both steps need to be safe. Checking the board, (9,6) and (9,5) are currently empty. The enemy snake is far away, so those positions should remain safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6) starts heading towards (7,3), but that's a longer path. However, if (9,5) is taken by another snake, but in this case, there's only one enemy snake, and they are on the left side. So (9,5) is likely safe.\n\nAnother risk: moving RIGHT to (9,7) is at the edge. If I go there, next moves have limited options. For example, from (9,7), I can only go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. But since I need to go DOWN to reach (9,5), that's manageable.\n\nConsidering all this, the best move is RIGHT towards (9,5). This path is short and avoids the enemy. \n\nWait, but what if there's a tail or obstacle at (9,7)? The current board shows row 7 (y=7) as having T's from x=3 to x=6, and my position at x=8. So (9,7) is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nSo the decision is to move RIGHT to (9,7), then proceed down towards the apple. Therefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (3,5) with a body that might be moving.

Since I moved right last turn, my tail would have moved, so (8,7) might now be part of my body. Wait, if I didn't eat an apple last move, moving right would mean my tail moves forward. The last move was from (8,7) to (9,7). Since there's no apple at (9,7), my snake didn't grow. So the tail would have moved, making (8,7) part of the body. Therefore, moving LEFT to (8,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Can't move right since x=9 is the maximum. So RIGHT is invalid (wall).\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN. LEFT is unsafe, RIGHT is a wall.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards apples? The closest apples are (9,9) and (9,5). \n\n- **UP** towards (9,8) gets closer to (9,9). From (9,8), next move UP to (9,9) would collect the apple. But need to check if (9,8) is safe. The board shows (9,8) as empty. So moving UP is a good path to (9,9).\n\n- **DOWN** towards (9,6) gets closer to (9,5). From (9,6), next move DOWN to (9,5) would collect that apple. (9,5) is an apple, so that's a valid path.\n\nWhich apple is better? (9,9) is two moves away (UP then UP), and (9,5) is two moves away (DOWN then DOWN). Both are equally distant. However, after collecting (9,9), the next move would be into a corner, which might limit options. Collecting (9,5) leaves more space to maneuver. \n\nAlso, considering the enemy snake at (3,5), moving towards (9,5) is safe as they are far away. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving UP to (9,8), the next move to (9,9) would require turning, but since that's the edge, after eating the apple, the snake would need to turn left or right. But since (9,9) is a corner, moving left from there would be into (8,9), which is empty. However, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail extends. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) then DOWN to (9,5) allows for possible continuation to the left towards other apples like (7,3) or (5,4). \n\nAnother point: the apple at (9,9) is in the top-right corner. If I go there, after eating, I have to move left or down. But moving left from (9,9) would be (8,9), which is empty. \n\nHmm. Both options are viable. Let's check the board again. The apple at (9,9) is present, and (9,5) is also present. \n\nSince both are two moves away, perhaps prioritize the one that allows more flexibility after collection. Moving towards (9,5) might be better because after eating, moving left towards (8,5) could lead to the apple at (5,4) next. Alternatively, moving towards (9,9) would require moving left along the top edge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,5) is safer because the enemy snake is on the left side, so staying on the right edge might be safer. \n\nGiven that, I think moving DOWN towards (9,5) is the better option.

Whether we move RIGHT or DOWN first, we\u2019ll be at a Manhattan distance of 1 from that apple. For example, if we move RIGHT to (5,5) then the apple is directly below (5,5) and we can move DOWN on the next turn. Alternatively, moving DOWN puts us at (4,4), and the apple is just to our right.  \n\nBoth moves seem safe, but moving RIGHT keeps our horizontal direction on track toward the apple while maintaining flexibility. There aren\u2019t any nearby hazards from enemy Snake #2 (currently at (9,6) with its body along row 7) so risk is minimal.  \n\nThus, I decide that the safest and most direct move toward the closest apple is to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

The enemy snake #1 is at (4,5) with a body that's probably moving. The board shows my position at (9,6) now.\n\nPossible directions from (9,6):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,7). Wait, in the previous move, I was at (9,7) and moved DOWN to (9,6). So (9,7) is part of my body now. Moving UP would hit my own body. So UP is unsafe.\n- **DOWN**: To (9,5). That's an apple! If I move DOWN, I'll eat the apple at (9,5), gain a point, and grow. That's good. But need to check if (9,5) is safe. The board shows it as 'A', so no snake there. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (8,6). The board shows (8,6) as empty. But need to check if that's part of any snake's body. Looking at the enemy snake positions, their body is at [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]. So (8,6) is clear. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Can't move right, since x=9 is the maximum. So invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN and LEFT. UP is unsafe, RIGHT is a wall.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,5), I eat the apple. That's a good move. Then next turn, I'll be longer. But after eating, I need to plan the next move. From (9,5), possible directions would be UP (back to (9,6), which is part of my body after moving down), LEFT to (8,5), or DOWN to (9,4). But (9,4) is empty. However, moving DOWN from (9,5) would be possible. But eating the apple would make my tail stay, so the body would extend. So after moving DOWN to (9,5), the next move could be LEFT to (8,5) to head towards the apple at (5,4) or (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6) would take me towards the center. From there, maybe go towards (7,3) or (5,4). But (8,6) is safe. However, moving LEFT doesn't get me an apple immediately. \n\nSo the best immediate gain is moving DOWN to eat the apple at (9,5). That gives a point and extends the snake. The risk is that after eating, I need to avoid colliding with my own body. But since the next move after eating would be from (9,5), and the body would have grown, the tail would be at the previous end. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So after moving to (9,5), the next move's tail would be the same as before, but the head is at (9,5). So the body would be [(9,6), (9,7), ...] but depends on the previous positions. Wait, the snake's body is a list. Let me think: if the snake was at (9,6) now, and the previous positions were (9,7) before moving down. So the body is [(9,6), (9,7), ...]. If I move down to (9,5), the new body becomes [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the tail would stay where it was, but the head moves. So next turn, moving from (9,5), possible directions would be LEFT to (8,5), DOWN to (9,4), or RIGHT (invalid). So moving LEFT would be safe if (8,5) is empty. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6) would not get an apple but might set up a path towards (7,3) or (5,4). But (5,4) is an apple. So from (8,6), moving LEFT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo the immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (9,5) by moving DOWN. That's the best option. No risk of collision, gains a point. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple.

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2). So moving left towards (5,2) is safe. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take me back to (7,2). But my previous position was (7,2) before moving to (6,2). Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now.

The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5).

But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving here would eat it, grow, and gain a point. But need to ensure it's not occupied by another snake. The board shows (2,5) as 'A' (apple), so it's safe. No snakes are reported there.\n\n- DOWN to (2,3): That's where my body was. Since I just moved UP to (2,4), the previous position (2,3) is part of my body now.

The closest is (2,5) directly UP. Eating that would be efficient. However, after eating, the snake's body grows, so the tail stays in place.

Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better. Let's go UP to (2,6) to set up for the next apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6) with body parts at [(0,5), (0,4)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,6), and there's an apple at (2,7) directly above me. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,7) with body parts at [(0,6), (0,5)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) to the right and up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,8) with body parts at [(0,7), (0,6)]. The board shows my head at (3,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) two cells to the right. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (3,7) are UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), or RIGHT to (4,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (3,8):** The cell is empty. Safe to move. No immediate apple here, but moving up could help navigate towards other areas.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** The cell is empty. Safe. However, moving down might take me away from the apple at (5,7).\n\n- **LEFT (2,7):** The cell is part of my body? Wait, my snake's current position is (3,7), and the last move was RIGHT from (2,7). So the previous position was (2,7), which is now part of the body. Moving LEFT to (2,7) would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** Closer to the apple at (5,7). Next move could be RIGHT again to (5,7) to collect the apple. This is the most direct path to gain a point quickly.\n\n- **UP (3,8):** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Might need to plan a path towards other apples like (9,9) or (7,3) later.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** Safe but moves away from the nearest apple. However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down. But moving down here would require subsequent moves left, which might conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nCheck enemy positions: Snake #1 is at (0,8). Their possible moves are UP to (0,9), DOWN to (0,7), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (1,8), that's not in my current path. My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position. But for the current turn, focusing on securing the apple is key.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,7) to approach the apple at (5,7) safely.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5, 7) after moving right last turn. The apples are at (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), and (1,9). The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The options are UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), or RIGHT (7,7). \n\nLooking at the board state:\n- UP (6,8): The row 8 (y=8) has T's (tails?) at (1,8) and (0,8), but (6,8) is empty. So moving up is safe.\n- DOWN (6,6): Row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T at (1,6), but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (5,7): My previous position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The closest apples are (7,3) and (9,5). \n\nFrom (6,7), moving RIGHT to (7,7) gets me closer to (9,5). Moving DOWN to (6,6) starts heading towards (7,3). Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves. For (7,3): from (6,6), moving right to (7,6), then down three times. That's 4 moves as well. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now keeps me on a path that can reach both apples, while moving DOWN commits to (7,3). However, (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if I get trapped. \n\nAlso, enemy snake #1 is on the left, so the right side is safer. Moving RIGHT towards (9,5) seems viable. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (3,5) is in the middle. From (6,7), moving left isn't possible, but moving down and left could be a path. However, LEFT is blocked by my body. \n\nSo the best options are RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,7), next turn I can decide to go right again or down. If I move DOWN to (6,6), next turn I can go right towards (7,6). \n\nSince both paths are safe, but moving RIGHT continues the current trajectory towards (9,5), which has another apple at (9,9) nearby, I'll choose RIGHT to maintain momentum towards that area.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "Okay, let me assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (7,7). The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with its body parts at [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. The board shows that at row 7 (y=7), the positions (7,7) is me (marked as 2), and there are T's (maybe tails?) around. \n\nFirst, possible directions from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- UP: (7,8). Looking at the board, row 8 has a T at (1,8) and others are empty. (7,8) seems clear. But need to check if that's a valid move. Wait, the board's state for y=8 (row 8) shows a T at (1,8) and (0,8). So (7,8) should be empty. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (7,6). Row 6 has a T at (1,6) (enemy snake's body). But (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (6,7). My previous position? Wait, from the last move info, I was at (7,7) after moving right from (6,7). If my snake has eaten an apple last move, then the tail might have extended. Wait, the last move direction was RIGHT, so if I ate an apple, the tail would stay. However, the board shows that in row 7 (y=7), positions (7,7) is me, and there's a T at (7,7)? Wait, looking at the board:\n\nThe row 7 (y=7) is: . . . T T T T 2 . . which I think corresponds to x=0 to 9. So (7,7) is position x=7, y=7, which is where I am. The T's are at x=3,4,5,6. So moving LEFT to (6,7) would be x=6, y=7. In the board, (6,7) is part of the T's (since x=6 in row 7 is marked as T). So moving LEFT would hit a tail, which is my own body part. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,7). In row 7, x=8 is empty. So it's safe. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples are at (7,3) (down), (9,9) (up-right), (9,5) (right and down), (1,9) (far left up), (3,5) (left and down). \n\nFrom (7,7), the closest apples are (9,5) and (7,3). (9,5) is two steps right and two down. (7,3) is four steps down. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), that's closer to (9,5). Next moves could be RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), but need to check for walls. (9,7) is valid, but moving DOWN from there would get me closer. Alternatively, moving down from (8,7) towards (8,6), then further down towards (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) would start heading towards (7,3). Then further down each step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might not lead directly to an apple unless I go towards (9,9), but that's a long path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7): Right x2 to (9,7), then down y2. Total 4 moves. If apples are collected upon moving into them, then stepping on (9,5) would require moving there. But the path must avoid obstacles.\n\nPath to (7,3): From (7,7), down 4 times. But may need to maneuver around possible tails or enemies. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6) or right to (8,6). But moving left would risk entering tail areas? Wait, in row 6 (y=6), (1,6) is a T (enemy's body), but (6,6) would be empty. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), maybe moving down to (7,5), then left/right to approach (7,3). \n\nI need to choose the safest path. The enemy snake is at (2,6) with body around (1,6-8). So the left side might be more dangerous. Moving right might be safer. \n\nAlso, considering the apple at (9,9), which is a corner, but that's far. The apple at (9,5) is closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,5) from (7,7) would require going left, but that's blocked by my tail. So that's not feasible. \n\nSo the options are between RIGHT towards (9,5) or DOWN towards (7,3). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now to (8,7) gives more space, while moving DOWN might lead into areas with possible enemy movement. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) with body parts on (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). So their head is at (2,6), and they could move in any direction except into their own body. They might move towards apples, maybe (3,5) or others. But they are on the left side, so moving right might avoid them. \n\nIf I move RIGHT, that takes me away from the enemy. \n\nBut also, after moving RIGHT, if I continue RIGHT to (9,7), then down to (9,5), that's 3 steps (including picking up the apple). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. From the current board, (9,9) is an apple, and the rest of row 9 has an apple at (9,5) and (9,9). So moving to (9,7) is safe. Then down to (9,6), (9,5) would be possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) is safe, then to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) \u2014 three downs from (7,7). But need to check if those positions are safe. In the current board, (7,6), (7,5), etc., are empty. \n\nSo both paths are viable. Which is shorter? The path to (9,5) is 3 moves (right, right, down), but the apple is at (9,5). The path to (7,3) is 4 moves (down, down, down, down). Wait, from (7,7), down four times to (7,3). So the apple is there. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first and then down could be better. However, if I move right now, I can collect (9,5) in three moves, but if I go down, maybe I can get (7,3) in four. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving down first: from (7,7) to (7,6) (down), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). But each step needs to be valid. \n\nAlso, the apple at (9,9) is another option, but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake's potential movement. If they are moving towards apples on the left, perhaps (3,5), then the right side is safer. \n\nConsidering all this, moving RIGHT to (8,7) seems like a good step towards the (9,5) apple, which is closer. So that's the chosen direction. \n\nBut wait, need to ensure that the next move after RIGHT is possible. For example, after moving to (8,7), next move could be RIGHT to (9,7), then down. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT, maybe go down from (8,7) towards (8,6), etc. \n\nAnother possible strategy: move DOWN to (7,6), heading towards (7,3). Let's compare:\n\nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 next move options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again to (9,7) is possible, then down to (9,6), (9,5). That's two more moves. \n\nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 next move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving down each time. \n\nWhich apple is more accessible? (7,3) is directly below, but (9,5) is farther but perhaps a straighter path. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding collision with enemy. The enemy is at (2,6), which is far from the right side, so moving right is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is RIGHT towards (9,5).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,5) with its body at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,7)]. The board shows that my position is at (8,7), and there are some T's around, which I assume are tails or body parts.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from (8,7). The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,8). Looking at the board, row 8 (y=8) seems mostly empty except for some T's at (1,8) and (0,8). (8,8) is empty, so this seems safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,6). Row 6 (y=6) has a T at (1,6) and (2,6) (enemy's head?), but (8,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,7). From the previous state, (7,7) was part of my body (marked as 2). But after moving right to (8,7), my tail might have shifted. Wait, the current board shows my snake at (8,7), so the previous position (7,7) might now be a tail. If I didn't eat an apple last move, moving left would go back into my tail. But did I eat an apple? Last move was from (7,7) to (8,7). If there was an apple at (8,7), I would have grown. But looking at the apples listed, (8,7) isn't an apple. So I didn't eat an apple, so my tail would have moved forward. Therefore, (7,7) is now part of my body. So moving LEFT to (7,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,7). The x=9 is within the board (since coordinates go up to 9). (9,7) is empty according to the board. Safe.\n\nSo possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? Let's look at the apples:\n\n- **(7,3)**: Down and left from (8,7). Requires moving down 4 times and left once. But moving left might not be safe next steps.\n- **(9,9)**: Up and right. From (8,7), moving up to (8,8), then right to (9,8), then up to (9,9). That's three moves. But (9,9) is a corner, so once there, I need to make sure I can turn without hitting walls.\n- **(9,5)**: Right and down. From (8,7), moving right to (9,7), then down to (9,6), (9,5). Two moves after RIGHT. This seems quick.\n- **(1,9)**: Far left and up. That's a long path, probably not the best option.\n- **(3,5)**: Left and down. But moving left from (8,7) is blocked by my own body, so that path is not feasible.\n\nThe closest apples are (9,5) and (9,9). Let's prioritize these. Moving RIGHT to (9,7) gets me closer to both (9,5) and (9,9). From (9,7), I can go down towards (9,5) or up towards (9,9). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,8) starts heading towards (9,9), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN to (8,6) could lead towards (7,3), but that's further away.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake positions. The enemy is at (2,5) with body parts around. They are on the left side, so moving right towards (9,5) or (9,9) keeps me away from them, reducing collision risk.\n\nAlso, the apple at (9,5) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. That's efficient. The apple at (9,9) is three moves away. Since (9,5) is closer, I should aim for that first.\n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (9,7), the next move would be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). Both steps need to be safe. Checking the board, (9,6) and (9,5) are currently empty. The enemy snake is far away, so those positions should remain safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6) starts heading towards (7,3), but that's a longer path. However, if (9,5) is taken by another snake, but in this case, there's only one enemy snake, and they are on the left side. So (9,5) is likely safe.\n\nAnother risk: moving RIGHT to (9,7) is at the edge. If I go there, next moves have limited options. For example, from (9,7), I can only go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. But since I need to go DOWN to reach (9,5), that's manageable.\n\nConsidering all this, the best move is RIGHT towards (9,5). This path is short and avoids the enemy. \n\nWait, but what if there's a tail or obstacle at (9,7)? The current board shows row 7 (y=7) as having T's from x=3 to x=6, and my position at x=8. So (9,7) is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nSo the decision is to move RIGHT to (9,7), then proceed down towards the apple. Therefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The last move was from (8,7) to (9,7). Since there's no apple at (9,7), my snake didn't grow. So the tail would have moved, making (8,7) part of the body. Therefore, moving LEFT to (8,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Can't move right since x=9 is the maximum. So RIGHT is invalid (wall).\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN. LEFT is unsafe, RIGHT is a wall.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards apples? The closest apples are (9,9) and (9,5). \n\n- **UP** towards (9,8) gets closer to (9,9). From (9,8), next move UP to (9,9) would collect the apple. But need to check if (9,8) is safe. The board shows (9,8) as empty. So moving UP is a good path to (9,9).\n\n- **DOWN** towards (9,6) gets closer to (9,5). From (9,6), next move DOWN to (9,5) would collect that apple. (9,5) is an apple, so that's a valid path.\n\nWhich apple is better? (9,9) is two moves away (UP then UP), and (9,5) is two moves away (DOWN then DOWN). Both are equally distant. However, after collecting (9,9), the next move would be into a corner, which might limit options. Collecting (9,5) leaves more space to maneuver. \n\nAlso, considering the enemy snake at (3,5), moving towards (9,5) is safe as they are far away. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving UP to (9,8), the next move to (9,9) would require turning, but since that's the edge, after eating the apple, the snake would need to turn left or right. But since (9,9) is a corner, moving left from there would be into (8,9), which is empty. However, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail extends. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) then DOWN to (9,5) allows for possible continuation to the left towards other apples like (7,3) or (5,4). \n\nAnother point: the apple at (9,9) is in the top-right corner. If I go there, after eating, I have to move left or down. But moving left from (9,9) would be (8,9), which is empty. \n\nHmm. Both options are viable. Let's check the board again. The apple at (9,9) is present, and (9,5) is also present. \n\nSince both are two moves away, perhaps prioritize the one that allows more flexibility after collection. Moving towards (9,5) might be better because after eating, moving left towards (8,5) could lead to the apple at (5,4) next. Alternatively, moving towards (9,9) would require moving left along the top edge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,5) is safer because the enemy snake is on the left side, so staying on the right edge might be safer. \n\nGiven that, I think moving DOWN towards (9,5) is the better option.

That gives a point and extends the snake. The risk is that after eating, I need to avoid colliding with my own body. But since the next move after eating would be from (9,5), and the body would have grown, the tail would be at the previous end. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So after moving to (9,5), the next move's tail would be the same as before, but the head is at (9,5). So the body would be [(9,6), (9,7), ...] but depends on the previous positions. Wait, the snake's body is a list. Let me think: if the snake was at (9,6) now, and the previous positions were (9,7) before moving down. So the body is [(9,6), (9,7), ...]. If I move down to (9,5), the new body becomes [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the tail would stay where it was, but the head moves. So next turn, moving from (9,5), possible directions would be LEFT to (8,5), DOWN to (9,4), or RIGHT (invalid). So moving LEFT would be safe if (8,5) is empty. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6) would not get an apple but might set up a path towards (7,3) or (5,4). But (5,4) is an apple. So from (8,6), moving LEFT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo the immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (9,5) by moving DOWN. That's the best option. No risk of collision, gains a point. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (9,5) now because the last move was DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5), which was an apple. So I just ate that apple, so my snake will grow by one segment. The apples remaining are (7,3), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0), and (9,9) was already eaten? Wait, the initial list had (9,9) as an apple, but in the board state provided earlier, the top right (9,9) is marked as 'A', so maybe it's still there. Wait, the initial problem statement says apples at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0). So after moving down to (9,5), that apple is consumed, so the remaining apples are the others.\n\nNow, my snake's new position is (9,5), and the body has grown. The previous positions would be [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. Wait, the initial position before the last move was (9,6), moving down to (9,5). So the body would now be [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the next move needs to avoid colliding with my own body.\n\nPossible directions from (9,5):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,6). But (9,6) is part of my body now. Moving there would collide, so that's unsafe.\n- **DOWN**: To (9,4). Check if that's within the board. Y=4 is valid. Is there any obstacle? The board shows (9,4) as empty. The enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) with body parts elsewhere. So (9,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (8,5). Check the board. The board at (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Not possible, since x=9 is the maximum. So invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5).\n\nLooking at the apples remaining: (7,3), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0). The closest ones are (5,4) and (7,3). From (9,5), moving LEFT towards (8,5) would start heading towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,4) would go further down, but maybe towards the apple at (8,0) eventually.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next steps could be towards (7,5), then (7,4), etc., approaching (7,3). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) would allow me to go left towards (8,4), then (7,4), etc., but (8,0) is further down. However, (5,4) is in the middle. Let's see the positions:\n\nFrom (9,5):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,5). Then from there, possible directions would be LEFT again to (7,5), DOWN to (8,4), or UP to (8,6). Moving towards (7,5) could lead towards (7,3) apple. But that's a few moves away.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,4). Then from (9,4), possible moves LEFT to (8,4) or DOWN to (9,3). The apple at (8,0) is at y=0, so moving down further would get closer to that, but it's a long path. Alternatively, moving left from (9,4) towards (8,4) and then towards (5,4) apple.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is in the middle. So moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5) might be a better path towards (5,4). Let's plan the route:\n\nFrom (8,5), next move LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then LEFT to (5,3), then UP to (5,4) to get the apple. That's several moves, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) to get that apple. That's a shorter path. The apple at (7,3) is closer if I go down first.\n\nWait, from (9,5):\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves to reach (7,3). But moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) would also take three moves. So both paths are similar in steps.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might keep me more central, avoiding the edge. However, moving DOWN first might risk getting stuck near the bottom edge. But since the board is 10x10, moving down to (9,4) is still safe as long as there's a path back.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) with body parts. Their positions are [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. So they are in the middle-left area. If I move towards (5,4), I need to avoid their path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom edge. From (9,5), moving DOWN to (9,4), then continuing down to (9,3), (9,2), etc., could reach (8,0) eventually. But that's a long way and might not be efficient.\n\nGiven the options, moving LEFT to (8,5) seems better to start heading towards the central apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the edge, which might be safer in case of getting trapped.\n\nBut need to check if (8,5) is safe. The board shows it as empty. Enemy snake #1 is at (5,5), so (8,5) is clear. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) is also safe. Which direction is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next turn I can go LEFT again to (7,5), then DOWN towards (7,3). That path is towards the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) and then LEFT towards (7,3) or (5,4).\n\nHmm. Another factor: the apple at (5,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. From (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,3), UP to (5,4). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, from (9,4), moving LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), DOWN to (7,3) (apple), which is 3 moves. But (7,3) is an apple, so that's a quicker gain.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is closer if I go down first. Let me see:\n\nFrom (9,5):\n\nOption 1: DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves to reach the apple.\n\nOption 2: LEFT to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). Also three moves.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving DOWN first might allow me to collect the (8,0) apple later if needed, but that's far. Alternatively, moving LEFT first keeps me more central.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's position. If enemy snake #1 is moving towards (5,5), maybe they are heading towards the (5,4) apple. So if I can reach (5,4) before them, that's good. But from my current position, it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the (7,3) apple is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nIn this case, moving LEFT to (8,5) or DOWN to (9,4) are both valid. But which is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next move I can go LEFT again to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That path is clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me away from the edge, which can be risky if I get trapped. Edges can limit movement options. So moving towards the center might offer more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,5). This starts the journey towards the central apples and avoids potential edge traps. Next turn, I can plan to continue left or adjust direction based on the board state.\n</think>\n\nLEFT\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** Heading towards the (7,3) apple. Consider moving LEFT again if safe to approach the apple. Check for enemy snake movements."

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,0) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5).

The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left.

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe?

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe.

Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path.

So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,0) with no body segments. The board shows that my last move was LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2). \n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2). So moving left towards (5,2) is safe. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take me back to (7,2). But my previous position was (7,2) before moving to (6,2). Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT is the best choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7).

If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The board shows at y=4 (row 4), (2,4) is empty. So moving up is safe. Then next steps towards (2,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,2): That's where my tail was. Since I moved up last time, the tail might have moved. Wait, the board shows at (2,2) there's a 'T' (tail) from snake 2. So moving down to (2,2) would hit my own tail. But wait, when you move, the tail follows. So if I move down, the tail would move forward, so (2,2) might not be occupied anymore. Wait, no. The snake's body moves each turn. So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe. Then, from there, possible paths towards apples like (1,6) or others.\n\nRIGHT to (3,3): Check the board. At (3,3), it's empty. So moving right is safe. From there, could head towards (5,7) or (7,3).\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apples are (2,5) (up), (1,6) (up and left), (7,3) (right and down). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,4), next step could be UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's efficient. But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple. However, that's a longer path. Also, need to avoid other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3). Their body is at (0,2) and (1,2). So moving left to (1,3) is safe, but their head is at (0,3), which is two steps left from (2,3). So they might be moving towards other areas. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe. The board shows (2,4) is empty. No snakes there. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (2,5).\n</think>\n\nUP"

Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty.

Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better.

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (3,7) after moving RIGHT last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,8) with body parts at [(0,7), (0,6)]. The board shows my head at (3,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) two cells to the right. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (3,7) are UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), or RIGHT to (4,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (3,8):** The cell is empty. Safe to move. No immediate apple here, but moving up could help navigate towards other areas.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** The cell is empty. Safe. However, moving down might take me away from the apple at (5,7).\n\n- **LEFT (2,7):** The cell is part of my body? Wait, my snake's current position is (3,7), and the last move was RIGHT from (2,7). So the previous position was (2,7), which is now part of the body. Moving LEFT to (2,7) would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** Closer to the apple at (5,7). Next move could be RIGHT again to (5,7) to collect the apple. This is the most direct path to gain a point quickly.\n\n- **UP (3,8):** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Might need to plan a path towards other apples like (9,9) or (7,3) later.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** Safe but moves away from the nearest apple. However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down. But moving down here would require subsequent moves left, which might conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nCheck enemy positions: Snake #1 is at (0,8). Their possible moves are UP to (0,9), DOWN to (0,7), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (1,8), that's not in my current path. My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position. But for the current turn, focusing on securing the apple is key.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,7) to approach the apple at (5,7) safely.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,6) with body parts at [(1,7), (1,8), (0,8)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (6,7). The options are UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), or RIGHT (7,7). \n\nLooking at the board state:\n- UP (6,8): The row 8 (y=8) has T's (tails?) at (1,8) and (0,8), but (6,8) is empty. So moving up is safe.\n- DOWN (6,6): Row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T at (1,6), but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (5,7): My previous position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The closest apples are (7,3) and (9,5). \n\nFrom (6,7), moving RIGHT to (7,7) gets me closer to (9,5). Moving DOWN to (6,6) starts heading towards (7,3). Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves.

That's 4 moves as well. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now keeps me on a path that can reach both apples, while moving DOWN commits to (7,3).

If I move DOWN to (6,6), next turn I can go right towards (7,6). \n\nSince both paths are safe, but moving RIGHT continues the current trajectory towards (9,5), which has another apple at (9,9) nearby, I'll choose RIGHT to maintain momentum towards that area.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "Okay, let me assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (7,7). The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with its body parts at [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. The board shows that at row 7 (y=7), the positions (7,7) is me (marked as 2), and there are T's (maybe tails?) around. \n\nFirst, possible directions from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- UP: (7,8). Looking at the board, row 8 has a T at (1,8) and others are empty. (7,8) seems clear. But need to check if that's a valid move. Wait, the board's state for y=8 (row 8) shows a T at (1,8) and (0,8). So (7,8) should be empty. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (7,6). Row 6 has a T at (1,6) (enemy snake's body). But (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (6,7). My previous position? Wait, from the last move info, I was at (7,7) after moving right from (6,7). If my snake has eaten an apple last move, then the tail might have extended. Wait, the last move direction was RIGHT, so if I ate an apple, the tail would stay. However, the board shows that in row 7 (y=7), positions (7,7) is me, and there's a T at (7,7)? Wait, looking at the board:\n\nThe row 7 (y=7) is: . . . T T T T 2 . . which I think corresponds to x=0 to 9. So (7,7) is position x=7, y=7, which is where I am. The T's are at x=3,4,5,6. So moving LEFT to (6,7) would be x=6, y=7. In the board, (6,7) is part of the T's (since x=6 in row 7 is marked as T). So moving LEFT would hit a tail, which is my own body part. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,7). In row 7, x=8 is empty. So it's safe. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples are at (7,3) (down), (9,9) (up-right), (9,5) (right and down), (1,9) (far left up), (3,5) (left and down). \n\nFrom (7,7), the closest apples are (9,5) and (7,3). (9,5) is two steps right and two down. (7,3) is four steps down. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), that's closer to (9,5). Next moves could be RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), but need to check for walls. (9,7) is valid, but moving DOWN from there would get me closer. Alternatively, moving down from (8,7) towards (8,6), then further down towards (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) would start heading towards (7,3). Then further down each step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might not lead directly to an apple unless I go towards (9,9), but that's a long path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7): Right x2 to (9,7), then down y2. Total 4 moves. If apples are collected upon moving into them, then stepping on (9,5) would require moving there. But the path must avoid obstacles.\n\nPath to (7,3): From (7,7), down 4 times. But may need to maneuver around possible tails or enemies. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6) or right to (8,6). But moving left would risk entering tail areas? Wait, in row 6 (y=6), (1,6) is a T (enemy's body), but (6,6) would be empty. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), maybe moving down to (7,5), then left/right to approach (7,3). \n\nI need to choose the safest path. The enemy snake is at (2,6) with body around (1,6-8). So the left side might be more dangerous. Moving right might be safer. \n\nAlso, considering the apple at (9,9), which is a corner, but that's far. The apple at (9,5) is closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,5) from (7,7) would require going left, but that's blocked by my tail. So that's not feasible. \n\nSo the options are between RIGHT towards (9,5) or DOWN towards (7,3). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now to (8,7) gives more space, while moving DOWN might lead into areas with possible enemy movement. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) with body parts on (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). So their head is at (2,6), and they could move in any direction except into their own body. They might move towards apples, maybe (3,5) or others. But they are on the left side, so moving right might avoid them. \n\nIf I move RIGHT, that takes me away from the enemy. \n\nBut also, after moving RIGHT, if I continue RIGHT to (9,7), then down to (9,5), that's 3 steps (including picking up the apple). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. From the current board, (9,9) is an apple, and the rest of row 9 has an apple at (9,5) and (9,9). So moving to (9,7) is safe. Then down to (9,6), (9,5) would be possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) is safe, then to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) \u2014 three downs from (7,7). But need to check if those positions are safe. In the current board, (7,6), (7,5), etc., are empty. \n\nSo both paths are viable. Which is shorter? The path to (9,5) is 3 moves (right, right, down), but the apple is at (9,5). The path to (7,3) is 4 moves (down, down, down, down). Wait, from (7,7), down four times to (7,3). So the apple is there. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first and then down could be better. However, if I move right now, I can collect (9,5) in three moves, but if I go down, maybe I can get (7,3) in four. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving down first: from (7,7) to (7,6) (down), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). But each step needs to be valid. \n\nAlso, the apple at (9,9) is another option, but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake's potential movement. If they are moving towards apples on the left, perhaps (3,5), then the right side is safer. \n\nConsidering all this, moving RIGHT to (8,7) seems like a good step towards the (9,5) apple, which is closer. So that's the chosen direction. \n\nBut wait, need to ensure that the next move after RIGHT is possible. For example, after moving to (8,7), next move could be RIGHT to (9,7), then down. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT, maybe go down from (8,7) towards (8,6), etc. \n\nAnother possible strategy: move DOWN to (7,6), heading towards (7,3). Let's compare:\n\nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 next move options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again to (9,7) is possible, then down to (9,6), (9,5). That's two more moves. \n\nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 next move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving down each time. \n\nWhich apple is more accessible? (7,3) is directly below, but (9,5) is farther but perhaps a straighter path. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding collision with enemy. The enemy is at (2,6), which is far from the right side, so moving right is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is RIGHT towards (9,5).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,5) with its body at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,7)]. The board shows that my position is at (8,7), and there are some T's around, which I assume are tails or body parts.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from (8,7). The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,8). Looking at the board, row 8 (y=8) seems mostly empty except for some T's at (1,8) and (0,8). (8,8) is empty, so this seems safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,6). Row 6 (y=6) has a T at (1,6) and (2,6) (enemy's head?), but (8,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,7). From the previous state, (7,7) was part of my body (marked as 2). But after moving right to (8,7), my tail might have shifted. Wait, the current board shows my snake at (8,7), so the previous position (7,7) might now be a tail. If I didn't eat an apple last move, moving left would go back into my tail. But did I eat an apple? Last move was from (7,7) to (8,7). If there was an apple at (8,7), I would have grown. But looking at the apples listed, (8,7) isn't an apple. So I didn't eat an apple, so my tail would have moved forward. Therefore, (7,7) is now part of my body. So moving LEFT to (7,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,7). The x=9 is within the board (since coordinates go up to 9). (9,7) is empty according to the board. Safe.\n\nSo possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? Let's look at the apples:\n\n- **(7,3)**: Down and left from (8,7). Requires moving down 4 times and left once. But moving left might not be safe next steps.\n- **(9,9)**: Up and right. From (8,7), moving up to (8,8), then right to (9,8), then up to (9,9). That's three moves. But (9,9) is a corner, so once there, I need to make sure I can turn without hitting walls.\n- **(9,5)**: Right and down. From (8,7), moving right to (9,7), then down to (9,6), (9,5). Two moves after RIGHT. This seems quick.\n- **(1,9)**: Far left and up. That's a long path, probably not the best option.\n- **(3,5)**: Left and down. But moving left from (8,7) is blocked by my own body, so that path is not feasible.\n\nThe closest apples are (9,5) and (9,9). Let's prioritize these. Moving RIGHT to (9,7) gets me closer to both (9,5) and (9,9). From (9,7), I can go down towards (9,5) or up towards (9,9). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,8) starts heading towards (9,9), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN to (8,6) could lead towards (7,3), but that's further away.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake positions. The enemy is at (2,5) with body parts around. They are on the left side, so moving right towards (9,5) or (9,9) keeps me away from them, reducing collision risk.\n\nAlso, the apple at (9,5) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. That's efficient. The apple at (9,9) is three moves away. Since (9,5) is closer, I should aim for that first.\n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (9,7), the next move would be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). Both steps need to be safe. Checking the board, (9,6) and (9,5) are currently empty. The enemy snake is far away, so those positions should remain safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6) starts heading towards (7,3), but that's a longer path. However, if (9,5) is taken by another snake, but in this case, there's only one enemy snake, and they are on the left side. So (9,5) is likely safe.\n\nAnother risk: moving RIGHT to (9,7) is at the edge. If I go there, next moves have limited options. For example, from (9,7), I can only go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. But since I need to go DOWN to reach (9,5), that's manageable.\n\nConsidering all this, the best move is RIGHT towards (9,5). This path is short and avoids the enemy. \n\nWait, but what if there's a tail or obstacle at (9,7)? The current board shows row 7 (y=7) as having T's from x=3 to x=6, and my position at x=8. So (9,7) is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nSo the decision is to move RIGHT to (9,7), then proceed down towards the apple. Therefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Collecting (9,5) leaves more space to maneuver. \n\nAlso, considering the enemy snake at (3,5), moving towards (9,5) is safe as they are far away. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving UP to (9,8), the next move to (9,9) would require turning, but since that's the edge, after eating the apple, the snake would need to turn left or right. But since (9,9) is a corner, moving left from there would be into (8,9), which is empty. However, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail extends. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) then DOWN to (9,5) allows for possible continuation to the left towards other apples like (7,3) or (5,4). \n\nAnother point: the apple at (9,9) is in the top-right corner. If I go there, after eating, I have to move left or down. But moving left from (9,9) would be (8,9), which is empty. \n\nHmm. Both options are viable. Let's check the board again. The apple at (9,9) is present, and (9,5) is also present. \n\nSince both are two moves away, perhaps prioritize the one that allows more flexibility after collection. Moving towards (9,5) might be better because after eating, moving left towards (8,5) could lead to the apple at (5,4) next. Alternatively, moving towards (9,9) would require moving left along the top edge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,5) is safer because the enemy snake is on the left side, so staying on the right edge might be safer. \n\nGiven that, I think moving DOWN towards (9,5) is the better option. So the next move should be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN again to (9,5) to eat the apple. \n\nTherefore, the direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake #1 is at (4,5) with a body that's probably moving. The board shows my position at (9,6) now.\n\nPossible directions from (9,6):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,7). Wait, in the previous move, I was at (9,7) and moved DOWN to (9,6). So (9,7) is part of my body now. Moving UP would hit my own body. So UP is unsafe.\n- **DOWN**: To (9,5). That's an apple! If I move DOWN, I'll eat the apple at (9,5), gain a point, and grow. That's good. But need to check if (9,5) is safe. The board shows it as 'A', so no snake there. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (8,6). The board shows (8,6) as empty. But need to check if that's part of any snake's body. Looking at the enemy snake positions, their body is at [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]. So (8,6) is clear. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Can't move right, since x=9 is the maximum. So invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN and LEFT. UP is unsafe, RIGHT is a wall.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,5), I eat the apple. That's a good move. Then next turn, I'll be longer. But after eating, I need to plan the next move. From (9,5), possible directions would be UP (back to (9,6), which is part of my body after moving down), LEFT to (8,5), or DOWN to (9,4). But (9,4) is empty. However, moving DOWN from (9,5) would be possible. But eating the apple would make my tail stay, so the body would extend. So after moving DOWN to (9,5), the next move could be LEFT to (8,5) to head towards the apple at (5,4) or (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6) would take me towards the center. From there, maybe go towards (7,3) or (5,4). But (8,6) is safe. However, moving LEFT doesn't get me an apple immediately. \n\nSo the best immediate gain is moving DOWN to eat the apple at (9,5). That gives a point and extends the snake. The risk is that after eating, I need to avoid colliding with my own body. But since the next move after eating would be from (9,5), and the body would have grown, the tail would be at the previous end. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So after moving to (9,5), the next move's tail would be the same as before, but the head is at (9,5). So the body would be [(9,6), (9,7), ...] but depends on the previous positions. Wait, the snake's body is a list. Let me think: if the snake was at (9,6) now, and the previous positions were (9,7) before moving down. So the body is [(9,6), (9,7), ...]. If I move down to (9,5), the new body becomes [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the tail would stay where it was, but the head moves. So next turn, moving from (9,5), possible directions would be LEFT to (8,5), DOWN to (9,4), or RIGHT (invalid). So moving LEFT would be safe if (8,5) is empty. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6) would not get an apple but might set up a path towards (7,3) or (5,4). But (5,4) is an apple. So from (8,6), moving LEFT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo the immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (9,5) by moving DOWN. That's the best option. No risk of collision, gains a point. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So I just ate that apple, so my snake will grow by one segment. The apples remaining are (7,3), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0), and (9,9) was already eaten? Wait, the initial list had (9,9) as an apple, but in the board state provided earlier, the top right (9,9) is marked as 'A', so maybe it's still there. Wait, the initial problem statement says apples at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0). So after moving down to (9,5), that apple is consumed, so the remaining apples are the others.\n\nNow, my snake's new position is (9,5), and the body has grown. The previous positions would be [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. Wait, the initial position before the last move was (9,6), moving down to (9,5). So the body would now be [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the next move needs to avoid colliding with my own body.\n\nPossible directions from (9,5):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,6). But (9,6) is part of my body now. Moving there would collide, so that's unsafe.\n- **DOWN**: To (9,4). Check if that's within the board. Y=4 is valid. Is there any obstacle? The board shows (9,4) as empty. The enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) with body parts elsewhere. So (9,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (8,5). Check the board. The board at (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Not possible, since x=9 is the maximum. So invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5).\n\nLooking at the apples remaining: (7,3), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0). The closest ones are (5,4) and (7,3). From (9,5), moving LEFT towards (8,5) would start heading towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,4) would go further down, but maybe towards the apple at (8,0) eventually.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next steps could be towards (7,5), then (7,4), etc., approaching (7,3). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) would allow me to go left towards (8,4), then (7,4), etc., but (8,0) is further down. However, (5,4) is in the middle. Let's see the positions:\n\nFrom (9,5):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,5). Then from there, possible directions would be LEFT again to (7,5), DOWN to (8,4), or UP to (8,6). Moving towards (7,5) could lead towards (7,3) apple. But that's a few moves away.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,4). Then from (9,4), possible moves LEFT to (8,4) or DOWN to (9,3). The apple at (8,0) is at y=0, so moving down further would get closer to that, but it's a long path. Alternatively, moving left from (9,4) towards (8,4) and then towards (5,4) apple.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is in the middle. So moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5) might be a better path towards (5,4). Let's plan the route:\n\nFrom (8,5), next move LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then LEFT to (5,3), then UP to (5,4) to get the apple. That's several moves, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) to get that apple. That's a shorter path. The apple at (7,3) is closer if I go down first.\n\nWait, from (9,5):\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves to reach (7,3). But moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) would also take three moves. So both paths are similar in steps.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might keep me more central, avoiding the edge. However, moving DOWN first might risk getting stuck near the bottom edge. But since the board is 10x10, moving down to (9,4) is still safe as long as there's a path back.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) with body parts. Their positions are [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. So they are in the middle-left area. If I move towards (5,4), I need to avoid their path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom edge. From (9,5), moving DOWN to (9,4), then continuing down to (9,3), (9,2), etc., could reach (8,0) eventually. But that's a long way and might not be efficient.\n\nGiven the options, moving LEFT to (8,5) seems better to start heading towards the central apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the edge, which might be safer in case of getting trapped.\n\nBut need to check if (8,5) is safe. The board shows it as empty. Enemy snake #1 is at (5,5), so (8,5) is clear. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) is also safe. Which direction is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next turn I can go LEFT again to (7,5), then DOWN towards (7,3). That path is towards the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) and then LEFT towards (7,3) or (5,4).\n\nHmm. Another factor: the apple at (5,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. From (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,3), UP to (5,4). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, from (9,4), moving LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), DOWN to (7,3) (apple), which is 3 moves. But (7,3) is an apple, so that's a quicker gain.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is closer if I go down first. Let me see:\n\nFrom (9,5):\n\nOption 1: DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves to reach the apple.\n\nOption 2: LEFT to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). Also three moves.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving DOWN first might allow me to collect the (8,0) apple later if needed, but that's far. Alternatively, moving LEFT first keeps me more central.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's position. If enemy snake #1 is moving towards (5,5), maybe they are heading towards the (5,4) apple. So if I can reach (5,4) before them, that's good. But from my current position, it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the (7,3) apple is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nIn this case, moving LEFT to (8,5) or DOWN to (9,4) are both valid. But which is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next move I can go LEFT again to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That path is clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me away from the edge, which can be risky if I get trapped. Edges can limit movement options. So moving towards the center might offer more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,5). This starts the journey towards the central apples and avoids potential edge traps. Next turn, I can plan to continue left or adjust direction based on the board state.\n</think>\n\nLEFT\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** Heading towards the (7,3) apple. Consider moving LEFT again if safe to approach the apple. Check for enemy snake movements."

Wait, the initial list had (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2), but in the problem statement, the user mentioned that after the last move, the snake ate an apple at (9,5), so that apple is gone. Wait, no\u2014the initial apples listed were (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). But in the board state provided, the apples at (7,3) and (7,2) are marked as 'A', so maybe those are still present. Wait, the user's last move was from (9,6) to (9,5), which was an apple. So that apple at (9,5) was consumed. The remaining apples are (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). Wait, but in the board state, (7,3) and (7,2) are both 'A's. So those are still there. So the current apples are those five, minus the one at (9,5) which was eaten.\n\nNow, my snake's current position is (8,5). The body segments would be [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), ...] because after eating the apple, the snake grows. So the next move must avoid colliding with its own body.\n\nPossible directions from (8,5):\n\n- **UP**: To (8,6). Check the board. The board at (8,6) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: To (8,4). Check the board. The board shows (8,4) as empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (7,5). The board at (7,5) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: To (9,5). But (9,5) is part of my body now. Moving there would collide. So invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (7,3) is two steps down and one left from (8,5). If I move LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves.\n- (5,4) is three steps left and one down from (8,5). Moving LEFT to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4). That's four moves.\n- (8,0) is five steps down from (8,5). Moving DOWN each step.\n- (1,9) is far to the left and top. Probably not worth going for now.\n- (9,9) is at the top right. Also far.\n\nThe closest apples are (7,3) and (5,4). Let's plan the path.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7,5), that's a step towards both (7,3) and (5,4). From (7,5), next move could be DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) for the apple. Alternatively, from (7,5), moving LEFT to (6,5) towards (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (8,4) would take me closer to (8,0), but that's a longer path. Or moving UP to (8,6) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there, which there isn't.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT towards (7,5) or DOWN towards (8,4). Let's evaluate:\n\nMoving LEFT to (7,5) gets me closer to (7,3) and (5,4). From there, I can choose to go down towards (7,3) or continue left towards (5,4). \n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4) would allow me to go left towards (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's also a valid path. \n\nWhich path is shorter? Both require three moves to reach (7,3). However, moving LEFT first might offer more flexibility. For example, from (7,5), I can adjust direction based on any obstacles or enemy movements.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (5,4) with body parts. Their head is at (5,4), which is an apple. Wait, the apple at (5,4) is where the enemy snake's head is. Wait, the initial problem statement says apples at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). So (5,4) is not an apple. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nThe initial apples listed are (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). So (5,4) is not an apple. The enemy snake's head is at (5,4), but that's not an apple. So the apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). So the closest apples are (7,3) and (7,2). Wait, (7,2) is also an apple. So from (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) gets the apple at (7,3). Alternatively, from (7,5), moving DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (7,3) would be another path. Or if I go DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3).\n\nWait, the apple at (7,2) is at (7,2). From (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) would take four moves. But that's two apples. However, the snake can only eat one apple at a time. So maybe prioritize the closest one.\n\nSo the apple at (7,3) is two moves away if I go LEFT then DOWN twice. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) is also two moves. Wait, no: from (8,5), moving DOWN to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves. Wait, (8,5) \u2192 DOWN to (8,4) (move 1), LEFT to (7,4) (move 2), DOWN to (7,3) (move 3). So three moves. Same as the other path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) is three moves. So same steps.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might be better because it positions me closer to other apples like (7,2) after getting (7,3). Also, moving LEFT gets me away from the edge, which is safer.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is at [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. Their head is at (5,4). So they are in the middle-left area. If I move towards (7,3), I need to avoid their path. But since they are at (5,4), moving towards (7,3) is safe as long as they don't move into that area.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT to (7,5) to start heading towards the (7,3) apple. This path is safe and leads towards an apple. Next moves can be DOWN to (7,4) and then DOWN to (7,3) to collect the apple. Additionally, after that, moving further down to (7,2) would get another apple. \n\nChecking for immediate dangers: moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. The board shows (7,5) as empty. Enemy snakes are not in that area. My own body is at (8,5), (9,5), etc., so no collision there.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (7,5).\n</think>\n\nLEFT\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** Continue towards the (7,3) apple. Consider moving DOWN next if safe to approach the apple. Monitor enemy snake #1's movements near (5,4)."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,2). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. Apples are at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (1,0), (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,0) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't immediately contribute to apple collection. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (3,0) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (7,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (3,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But from (7,2), moving left would get me closer to (2,2) which is at x=2. That's a few moves away. However, there's an apple at (0,2) as well. So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,2) to the left and (7,3) to the right. Continuing left towards (2,2) would require moving to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. That's two more moves.

The apple at (7,3) requires moving up and right. \n\nSince the snake's goal is to collect apples without dying, the safest and most efficient path is to continue moving LEFT towards (2,2).

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with a body part at (1,1). The board shows that at position (3,2), I'm snake #2.\n\nPossible directions from (3,2) are LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), or DOWN to (3,1). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT to (2,2) would get me the apple there. That's a direct move to an apple, which would make me grow. But I need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. The board shows that (2,2) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. No snakes are there. So moving LEFT would collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (3,3), moving left and up could reach (2,5) in a few moves, but that's longer. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) would take me back to where I was two moves ago, but since the snake's body moves each turn, that position might be clear now. However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,5) with body parts at [(0,4), (0,3)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,5), and there's an apple at (2,7) which is two spaces up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,5) are UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), or RIGHT to (3,5).\n\nFirst, check safety:\n\n- UP to (2,6): That's empty. Then next move could go to (2,7) which is an apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Since moving UP now is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): That's part of my body now, since I just moved up to (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): Check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,5), so (1,5) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (0,5), and their body is at (0,4) and (0,3). So (1,5) is empty. Moving LEFT here is safe. From (1,5), next move could go towards the apple at (1,6) by moving UP.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5): Empty space. Then could head towards (5,7) or (7,3) apples. But those are further away.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (2,7) two steps up and (1,6) one step left and one up. If I move UP now to (2,6), next turn I can go to (2,7) for the apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn. But maybe they're moving elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could lead towards (5,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,3) is even further. The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5). If they move right, they could go to (1,5), which is where I might go if I move LEFT. So if I move LEFT to (1,5), and the enemy moves right to (1,5) next turn, we'd collide. That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better. Let's go UP to (2,6) to set up for the next apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6) with body parts at [(0,5), (0,4)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,6), and there's an apple at (2,7) directly above me. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,7):** That's an apple. Moving here would collect it, grow, and gain a point. Need to ensure the cell is safe. The board shows (2,7) as an apple (A), so no snake is there. Safe to move.\n\n- **DOWN (2,5):** That's part of my body. The previous position after moving UP last time would have the body trailing. If I moved from (2,5) to (2,6) last turn, then the next body segment would be at (2,5). So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Check if occupied. The board shows (1,6) as an apple (A). So moving LEFT here would collect that apple. However, need to check if any enemy is there. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), which is two cells to the left. Their body is at (0,5) and (0,4). So (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (1,6) would collect the apple and grow.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Check the cell. The board shows (3,6) as empty. No immediate threats. Safe to move.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and safety:\n\n- **UP to (2,7):** Collects apple, grows, and positions head at (2,7). Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

At row 8, column 4, is that empty? From the board state given, row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's head at (1,8) and some other parts. The cell (4,8) seems empty. So moving up is safe but doesn't get the apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (4,6):** The cell (4,6) is empty. Safe, but moves away from the apple.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (5,7) to eat the apple. No immediate threats there. Next turn, I'll have to plan a path to avoid colliding with my own body as it grows. But for now, securing the apple is the priority. \n\nAnother consideration: After eating the apple, the next move from (5,7) could be RIGHT to (6,7), UP to (5,8), or DOWN to (5,6). Need to check those cells next turn, but that's future planning. For this turn, RIGHT is the optimal move.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5, 7) after moving right last turn. The apples are at (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), and (1,9). The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,6) with body parts at [(1,7), (1,8), (0,8)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (6,7).

So moving up is safe.\n- DOWN (6,6): Row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T at (1,6), but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (5,7): My previous position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The closest apples are (7,3) and (9,5). \n\nFrom (6,7), moving RIGHT to (7,7) gets me closer to (9,5). Moving DOWN to (6,6) starts heading towards (7,3). Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves.

If I move DOWN to (6,6), next turn I can go right towards (7,6). \n\nSince both paths are safe, but moving RIGHT continues the current trajectory towards (9,5), which has another apple at (9,9) nearby, I'll choose RIGHT to maintain momentum towards that area.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "Okay, let me assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (7,7). The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with its body parts at [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. The board shows that at row 7 (y=7), the positions (7,7) is me (marked as 2), and there are T's (maybe tails?) around. \n\nFirst, possible directions from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- UP: (7,8). Looking at the board, row 8 has a T at (1,8) and others are empty. (7,8) seems clear. But need to check if that's a valid move. Wait, the board's state for y=8 (row 8) shows a T at (1,8) and (0,8). So (7,8) should be empty. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (7,6). Row 6 has a T at (1,6) (enemy snake's body). But (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (6,7). My previous position? Wait, from the last move info, I was at (7,7) after moving right from (6,7). If my snake has eaten an apple last move, then the tail might have extended. Wait, the last move direction was RIGHT, so if I ate an apple, the tail would stay. However, the board shows that in row 7 (y=7), positions (7,7) is me, and there's a T at (7,7)? Wait, looking at the board:\n\nThe row 7 (y=7) is: . . . T T T T 2 . . which I think corresponds to x=0 to 9. So (7,7) is position x=7, y=7, which is where I am. The T's are at x=3,4,5,6. So moving LEFT to (6,7) would be x=6, y=7. In the board, (6,7) is part of the T's (since x=6 in row 7 is marked as T). So moving LEFT would hit a tail, which is my own body part. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,7). In row 7, x=8 is empty. So it's safe. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples are at (7,3) (down), (9,9) (up-right), (9,5) (right and down), (1,9) (far left up), (3,5) (left and down). \n\nFrom (7,7), the closest apples are (9,5) and (7,3). (9,5) is two steps right and two down. (7,3) is four steps down. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), that's closer to (9,5). Next moves could be RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), but need to check for walls. (9,7) is valid, but moving DOWN from there would get me closer. Alternatively, moving down from (8,7) towards (8,6), then further down towards (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) would start heading towards (7,3). Then further down each step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might not lead directly to an apple unless I go towards (9,9), but that's a long path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7): Right x2 to (9,7), then down y2. Total 4 moves. If apples are collected upon moving into them, then stepping on (9,5) would require moving there. But the path must avoid obstacles.\n\nPath to (7,3): From (7,7), down 4 times. But may need to maneuver around possible tails or enemies. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6) or right to (8,6). But moving left would risk entering tail areas? Wait, in row 6 (y=6), (1,6) is a T (enemy's body), but (6,6) would be empty. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), maybe moving down to (7,5), then left/right to approach (7,3). \n\nI need to choose the safest path. The enemy snake is at (2,6) with body around (1,6-8). So the left side might be more dangerous. Moving right might be safer. \n\nAlso, considering the apple at (9,9), which is a corner, but that's far. The apple at (9,5) is closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,5) from (7,7) would require going left, but that's blocked by my tail. So that's not feasible. \n\nSo the options are between RIGHT towards (9,5) or DOWN towards (7,3). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now to (8,7) gives more space, while moving DOWN might lead into areas with possible enemy movement. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) with body parts on (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). So their head is at (2,6), and they could move in any direction except into their own body. They might move towards apples, maybe (3,5) or others. But they are on the left side, so moving right might avoid them. \n\nIf I move RIGHT, that takes me away from the enemy. \n\nBut also, after moving RIGHT, if I continue RIGHT to (9,7), then down to (9,5), that's 3 steps (including picking up the apple). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. From the current board, (9,9) is an apple, and the rest of row 9 has an apple at (9,5) and (9,9). So moving to (9,7) is safe. Then down to (9,6), (9,5) would be possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) is safe, then to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) \u2014 three downs from (7,7). But need to check if those positions are safe. In the current board, (7,6), (7,5), etc., are empty. \n\nSo both paths are viable. Which is shorter? The path to (9,5) is 3 moves (right, right, down), but the apple is at (9,5). The path to (7,3) is 4 moves (down, down, down, down). Wait, from (7,7), down four times to (7,3). So the apple is there. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first and then down could be better. However, if I move right now, I can collect (9,5) in three moves, but if I go down, maybe I can get (7,3) in four. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving down first: from (7,7) to (7,6) (down), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). But each step needs to be valid. \n\nAlso, the apple at (9,9) is another option, but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake's potential movement. If they are moving towards apples on the left, perhaps (3,5), then the right side is safer. \n\nConsidering all this, moving RIGHT to (8,7) seems like a good step towards the (9,5) apple, which is closer. So that's the chosen direction. \n\nBut wait, need to ensure that the next move after RIGHT is possible. For example, after moving to (8,7), next move could be RIGHT to (9,7), then down. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT, maybe go down from (8,7) towards (8,6), etc. \n\nAnother possible strategy: move DOWN to (7,6), heading towards (7,3). Let's compare:\n\nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 next move options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again to (9,7) is possible, then down to (9,6), (9,5). That's two more moves. \n\nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 next move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving down each time. \n\nWhich apple is more accessible? (7,3) is directly below, but (9,5) is farther but perhaps a straighter path. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding collision with enemy. The enemy is at (2,6), which is far from the right side, so moving right is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is RIGHT towards (9,5).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (8,7) after moving right last turn. The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,5) with its body at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,7)]. The board shows that my position is at (8,7), and there are some T's around, which I assume are tails or body parts.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from (8,7). The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,8). Looking at the board, row 8 (y=8) seems mostly empty except for some T's at (1,8) and (0,8). (8,8) is empty, so this seems safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,6). Row 6 (y=6) has a T at (1,6) and (2,6) (enemy's head?), but (8,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,7). From the previous state, (7,7) was part of my body (marked as 2). But after moving right to (8,7), my tail might have shifted. Wait, the current board shows my snake at (8,7), so the previous position (7,7) might now be a tail. If I didn't eat an apple last move, moving left would go back into my tail. But did I eat an apple? Last move was from (7,7) to (8,7). If there was an apple at (8,7), I would have grown. But looking at the apples listed, (8,7) isn't an apple. So I didn't eat an apple, so my tail would have moved forward. Therefore, (7,7) is now part of my body. So moving LEFT to (7,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,7). The x=9 is within the board (since coordinates go up to 9). (9,7) is empty according to the board. Safe.\n\nSo possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? Let's look at the apples:\n\n- **(7,3)**: Down and left from (8,7). Requires moving down 4 times and left once. But moving left might not be safe next steps.\n- **(9,9)**: Up and right. From (8,7), moving up to (8,8), then right to (9,8), then up to (9,9). That's three moves. But (9,9) is a corner, so once there, I need to make sure I can turn without hitting walls.\n- **(9,5)**: Right and down. From (8,7), moving right to (9,7), then down to (9,6), (9,5). Two moves after RIGHT. This seems quick.\n- **(1,9)**: Far left and up. That's a long path, probably not the best option.\n- **(3,5)**: Left and down. But moving left from (8,7) is blocked by my own body, so that path is not feasible.\n\nThe closest apples are (9,5) and (9,9). Let's prioritize these. Moving RIGHT to (9,7) gets me closer to both (9,5) and (9,9). From (9,7), I can go down towards (9,5) or up towards (9,9). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,8) starts heading towards (9,9), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN to (8,6) could lead towards (7,3), but that's further away.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake positions. The enemy is at (2,5) with body parts around. They are on the left side, so moving right towards (9,5) or (9,9) keeps me away from them, reducing collision risk.\n\nAlso, the apple at (9,5) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. That's efficient. The apple at (9,9) is three moves away. Since (9,5) is closer, I should aim for that first.\n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (9,7), the next move would be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). Both steps need to be safe. Checking the board, (9,6) and (9,5) are currently empty. The enemy snake is far away, so those positions should remain safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6) starts heading towards (7,3), but that's a longer path. However, if (9,5) is taken by another snake, but in this case, there's only one enemy snake, and they are on the left side. So (9,5) is likely safe.\n\nAnother risk: moving RIGHT to (9,7) is at the edge. If I go there, next moves have limited options. For example, from (9,7), I can only go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. But since I need to go DOWN to reach (9,5), that's manageable.\n\nConsidering all this, the best move is RIGHT towards (9,5). This path is short and avoids the enemy. \n\nWait, but what if there's a tail or obstacle at (9,7)? The current board shows row 7 (y=7) as having T's from x=3 to x=6, and my position at x=8. So (9,7) is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nSo the decision is to move RIGHT to (9,7), then proceed down towards the apple. Therefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (3,5) with a body that might be moving. The board shows my position at (9,7), and the previous move was RIGHT from (8,7) to (9,7).\n\nFirst, check possible directions from (9,7):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,8).

Since I moved right last turn, my tail would have moved, so (8,7) might now be part of my body. Wait, if I didn't eat an apple last move, moving right would mean my tail moves forward. The last move was from (8,7) to (9,7). Since there's no apple at (9,7), my snake didn't grow. So the tail would have moved, making (8,7) part of the body. Therefore, moving LEFT to (8,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Can't move right since x=9 is the maximum. So RIGHT is invalid (wall).\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN. LEFT is unsafe, RIGHT is a wall.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards apples? The closest apples are (9,9) and (9,5). \n\n- **UP** towards (9,8) gets closer to (9,9). From (9,8), next move UP to (9,9) would collect the apple. But need to check if (9,8) is safe. The board shows (9,8) as empty. So moving UP is a good path to (9,9).\n\n- **DOWN** towards (9,6) gets closer to (9,5). From (9,6), next move DOWN to (9,5) would collect that apple. (9,5) is an apple, so that's a valid path.\n\nWhich apple is better? (9,9) is two moves away (UP then UP), and (9,5) is two moves away (DOWN then DOWN). Both are equally distant. However, after collecting (9,9), the next move would be into a corner, which might limit options. Collecting (9,5) leaves more space to maneuver. \n\nAlso, considering the enemy snake at (3,5), moving towards (9,5) is safe as they are far away. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving UP to (9,8), the next move to (9,9) would require turning, but since that's the edge, after eating the apple, the snake would need to turn left or right. But since (9,9) is a corner, moving left from there would be into (8,9), which is empty. However, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail extends. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) then DOWN to (9,5) allows for possible continuation to the left towards other apples like (7,3) or (5,4). \n\nAnother point: the apple at (9,9) is in the top-right corner. If I go there, after eating, I have to move left or down. But moving left from (9,9) would be (8,9), which is empty. \n\nHmm. Both options are viable. Let's check the board again. The apple at (9,9) is present, and (9,5) is also present. \n\nSince both are two moves away, perhaps prioritize the one that allows more flexibility after collection. Moving towards (9,5) might be better because after eating, moving left towards (8,5) could lead to the apple at (5,4) next. Alternatively, moving towards (9,9) would require moving left along the top edge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,5) is safer because the enemy snake is on the left side, so staying on the right edge might be safer. \n\nGiven that, I think moving DOWN towards (9,5) is the better option. So the next move should be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN again to (9,5) to eat the apple. \n\nTherefore, the direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

That gives a point and extends the snake. The risk is that after eating, I need to avoid colliding with my own body. But since the next move after eating would be from (9,5), and the body would have grown, the tail would be at the previous end. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So after moving to (9,5), the next move's tail would be the same as before, but the head is at (9,5). So the body would be [(9,6), (9,7), ...] but depends on the previous positions. Wait, the snake's body is a list. Let me think: if the snake was at (9,6) now, and the previous positions were (9,7) before moving down. So the body is [(9,6), (9,7), ...]. If I move down to (9,5), the new body becomes [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the tail would stay where it was, but the head moves.

Wait, the initial list had (9,9) as an apple, but in the board state provided earlier, the top right (9,9) is marked as 'A', so maybe it's still there. Wait, the initial problem statement says apples at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0). So after moving down to (9,5), that apple is consumed, so the remaining apples are the others.\n\nNow, my snake's new position is (9,5), and the body has grown. The previous positions would be [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. Wait, the initial position before the last move was (9,6), moving down to (9,5). So the body would now be [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the next move needs to avoid colliding with my own body.\n\nPossible directions from (9,5):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,6). But (9,6) is part of my body now. Moving there would collide, so that's unsafe.\n- **DOWN**: To (9,4). Check if that's within the board. Y=4 is valid. Is there any obstacle? The board shows (9,4) as empty. The enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) with body parts elsewhere. So (9,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (8,5). Check the board. The board at (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Not possible, since x=9 is the maximum. So invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5).\n\nLooking at the apples remaining: (7,3), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0). The closest ones are (5,4) and (7,3). From (9,5), moving LEFT towards (8,5) would start heading towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,4) would go further down, but maybe towards the apple at (8,0) eventually.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next steps could be towards (7,5), then (7,4), etc., approaching (7,3). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) would allow me to go left towards (8,4), then (7,4), etc., but (8,0) is further down. However, (5,4) is in the middle. Let's see the positions:\n\nFrom (9,5):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,5). Then from there, possible directions would be LEFT again to (7,5), DOWN to (8,4), or UP to (8,6). Moving towards (7,5) could lead towards (7,3) apple. But that's a few moves away.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,4). Then from (9,4), possible moves LEFT to (8,4) or DOWN to (9,3). The apple at (8,0) is at y=0, so moving down further would get closer to that, but it's a long path. Alternatively, moving left from (9,4) towards (8,4) and then towards (5,4) apple.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is in the middle. So moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5) might be a better path towards (5,4). Let's plan the route:\n\nFrom (8,5), next move LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then LEFT to (5,3), then UP to (5,4) to get the apple. That's several moves, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) to get that apple. That's a shorter path. The apple at (7,3) is closer if I go down first.\n\nWait, from (9,5):\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves to reach (7,3). But moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) would also take three moves. So both paths are similar in steps.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might keep me more central, avoiding the edge. However, moving DOWN first might risk getting stuck near the bottom edge. But since the board is 10x10, moving down to (9,4) is still safe as long as there's a path back.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) with body parts. Their positions are [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. So they are in the middle-left area. If I move towards (5,4), I need to avoid their path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom edge. From (9,5), moving DOWN to (9,4), then continuing down to (9,3), (9,2), etc., could reach (8,0) eventually. But that's a long way and might not be efficient.\n\nGiven the options, moving LEFT to (8,5) seems better to start heading towards the central apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the edge, which might be safer in case of getting trapped.\n\nBut need to check if (8,5) is safe. The board shows it as empty. Enemy snake #1 is at (5,5), so (8,5) is clear. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) is also safe. Which direction is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next turn I can go LEFT again to (7,5), then DOWN towards (7,3). That path is towards the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) and then LEFT towards (7,3) or (5,4).\n\nHmm. Another factor: the apple at (5,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. From (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,3), UP to (5,4). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, from (9,4), moving LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), DOWN to (7,3) (apple), which is 3 moves. But (7,3) is an apple, so that's a quicker gain.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is closer if I go down first. Let me see:\n\nFrom (9,5):\n\nOption 1: DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves to reach the apple.\n\nOption 2: LEFT to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). Also three moves.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving DOWN first might allow me to collect the (8,0) apple later if needed, but that's far. Alternatively, moving LEFT first keeps me more central.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's position. If enemy snake #1 is moving towards (5,5), maybe they are heading towards the (5,4) apple. So if I can reach (5,4) before them, that's good. But from my current position, it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the (7,3) apple is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nIn this case, moving LEFT to (8,5) or DOWN to (9,4) are both valid. But which is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next move I can go LEFT again to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That path is clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me away from the edge, which can be risky if I get trapped. Edges can limit movement options. So moving towards the center might offer more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,5). This starts the journey towards the central apples and avoids potential edge traps. Next turn, I can plan to continue left or adjust direction based on the board state.\n</think>\n\nLEFT\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** Heading towards the (7,3) apple. Consider moving LEFT again if safe to approach the apple. Check for enemy snake movements."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake (ID 2) is at (8,5) after moving LEFT from (9,5) in the last move. The apples left are (7,3), (1,9), (5,4), and (8,0). Wait, the initial list had (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2), but in the problem statement, the user mentioned that after the last move, the snake ate an apple at (9,5), so that apple is gone. Wait, no\u2014the initial apples listed were (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). But in the board state provided, the apples at (7,3) and (7,2) are marked as 'A', so maybe those are still present. Wait, the user's last move was from (9,6) to (9,5), which was an apple. So that apple at (9,5) was consumed. The remaining apples are (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). Wait, but in the board state, (7,3) and (7,2) are both 'A's. So those are still there. So the current apples are those five, minus the one at (9,5) which was eaten.\n\nNow, my snake's current position is (8,5). The body segments would be [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), ...] because after eating the apple, the snake grows. So the next move must avoid colliding with its own body.\n\nPossible directions from (8,5):\n\n- **UP**: To (8,6). Check the board. The board at (8,6) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: To (8,4). Check the board. The board shows (8,4) as empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (7,5). The board at (7,5) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: To (9,5). But (9,5) is part of my body now. Moving there would collide. So invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (7,3) is two steps down and one left from (8,5). If I move LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves.\n- (5,4) is three steps left and one down from (8,5). Moving LEFT to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4). That's four moves.\n- (8,0) is five steps down from (8,5). Moving DOWN each step.\n- (1,9) is far to the left and top. Probably not worth going for now.\n- (9,9) is at the top right. Also far.\n\nThe closest apples are (7,3) and (5,4). Let's plan the path.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7,5), that's a step towards both (7,3) and (5,4). From (7,5), next move could be DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) for the apple. Alternatively, from (7,5), moving LEFT to (6,5) towards (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (8,4) would take me closer to (8,0), but that's a longer path. Or moving UP to (8,6) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there, which there isn't.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT towards (7,5) or DOWN towards (8,4). Let's evaluate:\n\nMoving LEFT to (7,5) gets me closer to (7,3) and (5,4). From there, I can choose to go down towards (7,3) or continue left towards (5,4). \n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4) would allow me to go left towards (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's also a valid path. \n\nWhich path is shorter? Both require three moves to reach (7,3). However, moving LEFT first might offer more flexibility. For example, from (7,5), I can adjust direction based on any obstacles or enemy movements.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (5,4) with body parts. Their head is at (5,4), which is an apple. Wait, the apple at (5,4) is where the enemy snake's head is. Wait, the initial problem statement says apples at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). So (5,4) is not an apple. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nThe initial apples listed are (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). So (5,4) is not an apple. The enemy snake's head is at (5,4), but that's not an apple. So the apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). So the closest apples are (7,3) and (7,2). Wait, (7,2) is also an apple. So from (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) gets the apple at (7,3). Alternatively, from (7,5), moving DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (7,3) would be another path. Or if I go DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3).\n\nWait, the apple at (7,2) is at (7,2). From (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) would take four moves. But that's two apples. However, the snake can only eat one apple at a time. So maybe prioritize the closest one.\n\nSo the apple at (7,3) is two moves away if I go LEFT then DOWN twice. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) is also two moves. Wait, no: from (8,5), moving DOWN to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves. Wait, (8,5) \u2192 DOWN to (8,4) (move 1), LEFT to (7,4) (move 2), DOWN to (7,3) (move 3). So three moves. Same as the other path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) is three moves. So same steps.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might be better because it positions me closer to other apples like (7,2) after getting (7,3). Also, moving LEFT gets me away from the edge, which is safer.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is at [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. Their head is at (5,4). So they are in the middle-left area. If I move towards (7,3), I need to avoid their path. But since they are at (5,4), moving towards (7,3) is safe as long as they don't move into that area.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT to (7,5) to start heading towards the (7,3) apple. This path is safe and leads towards an apple. Next moves can be DOWN to (7,4) and then DOWN to (7,3) to collect the apple. Additionally, after that, moving further down to (7,2) would get another apple. \n\nChecking for immediate dangers: moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. The board shows (7,5) as empty. Enemy snakes are not in that area. My own body is at (8,5), (9,5), etc., so no collision there.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (7,5).\n</think>\n\nLEFT\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** Continue towards the (7,3) apple. Consider moving DOWN next if safe to approach the apple. Monitor enemy snake #1's movements near (5,4)."

The apples available are (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), and (7,2). The enemy snake #1 is at (6,4) with its body parts listed. The board shows their positions, so I need to avoid those.\n\nFirst, check possible directions from (8,4):\n- **UP**: To (8,5). But looking at the board state, (8,5) is part of my snake's body (since after moving DOWN to (8,4), the previous position was (8,5), which is now part of the body). So moving UP would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN**: To (8,3). Check the board. The board at (8,3) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (7,4). The board shows (7,4) as empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: To (9,4). The board at (9,4) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nNow, evaluate the closest apples. The apple at (7,3) is one step down and one left from (8,4). If I move LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) to eat the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,3), then LEFT to (7,3) would also reach the apple in two steps. \n\nAnother apple is at (7,2), which is two steps down from (8,4). Moving DOWN twice would get there. The apple at (8,0) is four steps down from (8,4), but that's a longer path. The other apples are too far.\n\nConsidering enemy snake #1's position at (6,4), moving LEFT to (7,4) brings me closer to their area, but their body is at (5,4), (5,5), etc. So (7,4) is still safe. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (7,4), next move could be DOWN to (7,3) for the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,3) allows me to go LEFT to (7,3) next. Both paths are valid. \n\nHowever, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions me closer to both (7,3) and (7,2) apples. Also, moving LEFT reduces the x-coordinate, which might help avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's path.\n\nCheck for immediate dangers: Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe. The board shows no obstacles there. Enemy snake #1 is at (6,4), which is one step left from (7,4). Wait, (6,4) is their head. So moving to (7,4) is adjacent to their head. If they move RIGHT into (7,4), that could be a collision next turn. But according to the current board, their head is at (6,4), and their body is at [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]. So their possible moves from (6,4) could be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If they move RIGHT to (7,4), that's where I'm planning to go. That's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (8,3) avoids that risk. From (8,3), I can then move LEFT to (7,3) to get the apple. This path avoids proximity to the enemy snake's head. \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (9,4) might lead towards the apple at (9,9), but that's a longer path and moving towards the edge could be risky. \n\nGiven the risk of the enemy snake moving into (7,4), it's safer to choose DOWN to (8,3). This avoids potential collision and still allows access to the apple at (7,3) next turn by moving LEFT. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,3).\n</think>\n\nDOWN\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** From (8,3), move LEFT to (7,3) to collect the apple.

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. My current position is (9,2). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and possible apple collection.\n\nIf I go LEFT, that would take me to (8,2). Is that safe? The enemy snake is at (5,0), which is far away. There's no apple there. But I need to check if moving left would hit any walls or other snakes. Since x=8 is within 0-9, it's safe. No snakes in that path. So LEFT is possible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, that's (10,2), which is outside the board. So RIGHT is a wall, which would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP, that's (9,3). No apples there. Is there any danger? The enemy is at (5,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, that's (9,1). Also safe. No apples there either.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (2,2). But (0,2) is far to the left. From (9,2), moving left towards (8,2), then (7,2), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is in the same y-coordinate as my current position. So if I move left multiple times, I can reach it. But that's 7 steps left. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, the apple at (5,7) is up and to the left. But that's higher y-coordinate. Let's see.\n\nWait, the apples are at (1,0) which is bottom left, (2,5) which is middle left, (5,7) top middle, (0,2) left middle, and (2,2) left middle. So the closest apples in terms of direction from (9,2) would be (2,2) and (0,2). But moving left towards (8,2) is the first step. However, moving left now would start heading towards those apples, but maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up to (9,3) and then left? But that might take longer. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next move could be LEFT again to (7,2), and so on. Each step left gets me closer to the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe moving up first to get to higher y and then left towards (5,7). But (5,7) is at x=5, y=7. From (9,2), moving up to y=7 would take 5 steps up, then left 4 steps. But that's a longer path. The apple at (5,7) is worth 1 point, but maybe it's better to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (9,2), moving left to x=2 would take 7 steps left, and up 3 steps. But that's a diagonal path. But since the snake can only move one step at a time, that's a longer path. So maybe the closest apple is (2,2), which is 7 steps left from (9,2). But that's a straight line. So moving left each time would get me there in 7 moves, collecting that apple. But that's a lot of moves. However, in the first move, moving left is safe and starts the journey towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. The enemy snake is at (5,0). So if I move left, I'm moving away from the enemy. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I move towards the left, I can avoid the enemy. Also, the enemy is at (5,0), which is in the bottom middle. So moving left from (9,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check each for immediate safety.\n\nLEFT to (8,2): safe, no obstacles.\n\nUP to (9,3): safe.\n\nDOWN to (9,1): safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,2) is at y=2, so same y as current. So moving left towards (8,2) would get me closer. The apple at (0,2) is even further left. So moving left is the direction towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,3) and then left could allow me to reach the apple at (5,7) eventually, but that's a longer path. But maybe that's a better strategy to collect multiple apples. However, the immediate move would be to go left towards (2,2) or (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,1) would take me towards the apple at (1,0), but that's at (1,0). From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc., but that's a long way. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) then (9,0) would be possible, but (9,0) is the bottom right corner. Then moving left from (9,0) to (8,0), etc., towards (1,0). But that's a long path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go LEFT towards (8,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2). Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately get me closer to any apples. So LEFT is the best choice here.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2). So moving left from (9,2) would take me to (8,2), then (7,2), etc., each step left. So after 7 moves left, I reach (2,2) and collect the apple. That's a long path, but each step is safe as long as I don't hit myself or others. Since the enemy is at (5,0), which is far away, and their body is empty, so they can't block me. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to (9,3) and then left. But that would take me to (8,3), which is not closer to any apples. Unless there's an apple at (5,7), but that's higher up. So maybe moving up first isn't better.\n\nSo the immediate best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apples on the left side. Also, moving left from (9,2) is safe, no walls, no snakes in that path. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my position.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (8,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (7,2). Is that safe? There's no snake there, and it's within the board. The enemy is at (4,0), which is far. So LEFT is safe and continues the path towards the apples at (2,2) and (0,2).\n\nMoving RIGHT would go back to (9,2), which I just left. But since my body might be there now? Wait, in the last move, I moved from (9,2) to (8,2). If I'm a snake, my body would now have a segment at (9,2) and the head at (8,2). So moving RIGHT back to (9,2) would collide with my own body. That's dangerous. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (8,2) to (8,3). No apples there, but safe. No snakes or walls. Could be a way to maneuver towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7) by moving up then left.\n\nDOWN to (8,1). Also safe. No immediate apples, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually, but that's a long path.\n\nThe closest apples are still (2,2) and (0,2) in the x-direction. Continuing left towards (7,2) gets me closer. Since moving RIGHT is unsafe, LEFT is the best option to continue towards those apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the enemy snake at (4,0) which is moving elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN could be safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. However, considering the apple at (2,5), moving up now might set a path to reach it. From (8,2), moving UP to (8,3), then left towards (7,3), (6,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The immediate gain is from (2,2), which is closer in x-coordinate.\n\nSo the safest and most strategic move is LEFT to (7,2), continuing the path towards the apples on the left.

So moving left could be a good path.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (8,2). Wait, where was I before? Last move I was at (8,2) and moved left to (7,2). So my body now has a segment at (8,2). If I move RIGHT back to (8,2), I would collide with my own body. That's a definite death. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nUP from (7,2) to (7,3). That's safe. No apples there, but maybe a path towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (7,3), moving up further could lead me north, then left towards those apples. But that's a longer path. The immediate apples are to the left.\n\nDOWN to (7,1). Also safe. No apples there, but moving down might lead towards the apple at (1,0) eventually. But that's a long way down. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so I'd need to go down from y=2 to y=0, which is two moves down, then left. But maybe not the most efficient.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left each time would get me closer. From (7,2), moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), etc., until I reach x=2. But there's an apple at (2,2), so that's a direct path. However, I need to check if there's any obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is not in my path. So moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,3) could allow me to go left towards (6,3), (5,3), etc., and then up to (2,5). But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,5) is at y=5, so I'd need to move up three times from (7,2) to get to y=5, then left. That's more steps, but maybe a safer path if there's a risk of collision otherwise.\n\nBut considering the current board, there's no immediate threat. The enemy snake is at (3,0), which is far away. My own body is at (8,2), so moving left is safe. The path to (2,2) is clear. So the best move is LEFT to (6,2), continuing towards the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is in the same y-coordinate. So moving left each time would get me there in 5 moves (from x=7 to x=2). But I need to make sure I don't hit any obstacles. Since the enemy is at (3,0), which is not in the same row, and there's no other snakes, it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards the apple at (2,5). But that's a trade-off between immediate progress towards a closer apple (2,2) versus a longer path to a higher apple (2,5). Since points are the goal, maybe collecting the closer apple first is better. \n\nSo the safest and most efficient move is LEFT towards (6,2), continuing the path to the apples on the left. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Let's check each direction.\n\nCurrent position: (6,2). Moving LEFT would take me to (5,2). Is there an apple there? No. The closest apple on the left is (2,2) and (0,2). Moving left continues towards those. But need to check for obstacles. The enemy is at (2,0), which is two steps down from (2,2).

Wait, no\u2014the snake's body would have a segment at (7,2) if I had moved from there. Wait, the last move was from (7,2) to (6,2), so the snake's body now includes (7,2) as part of its tail. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collide with my own body. Therefore, RIGHT is not safe.\n\nUP from (6,2) to (6,3). That's safe. No apples there, but moving up could lead towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). From (6,3), moving up again would get closer to (5,7). Alternatively, moving left from (6,3) towards (5,3), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nDOWN to (6,1). Safe. No apples there, but moving down could approach the apple at (1,0). However, that's a longer path. The apple at (1,0) is at y=0, so from (6,1), moving down to (6,0), then left to (5,0), etc. But that's a lot of steps. \n\nThe closest apples are (2,2) and (0,2) on the same y=2 line. Moving left each step would get me closer. From (6,2), left to (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) which has an apple. So in four moves, I can reach (2,2) and collect that apple. That seems efficient. \n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the way. There's no other snakes. My own body: since I just moved left from (7,2) to (6,2), the tail is at (7,2). As I move left, the tail follows, so the body segments would be behind me. So moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) could start a path towards the apple at (2,5) or (5,7). The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is up and to the left. From (6,3), moving left and up could reach it. But that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering the immediate points, the apple at (2,2) is closer. So moving LEFT towards it is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,2) is even further left. If I go all the way left to (0,2), that's six moves from (6,2). But collecting (2,2) first would give a point and allow me to grow, making the tail longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT to (5,2), continuing towards the closest apple. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (2,0), which is not in the path. My own body: after moving left, the tail would be at (6,2) (since the snake grows when it eats an apple). Wait, but I haven't eaten an apple yet. So moving left to (5,2) would not grow, so the tail would move forward. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since the next move to (5,2) doesn't land on an apple, the tail would follow. So the body would be at (6,2) and (5,2) after moving, with the tail at (7,2) moving off. So no collision. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and progresses towards the nearest apple. \n\nOther options: UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples. RIGHT is dangerous.

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with a body part at (2,0). The board shows that my snake is now at (5,2), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (5,2). The options are UP (to (5,3)), DOWN (to (5,1)), LEFT (to (4,2)), and RIGHT (to (6,2)). \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me back to (6,2), which was my previous position. However, since the snake's body moves each turn, the tail would have moved forward. Wait, the snake's body segments depend on whether it ate an apple. Since the last move didn't land on an apple (the apple at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is further left), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail would have moved. So the body segments would be [(6,2), (5,2)] now? Or is the snake's body longer? Wait, the initial position was (5,2) as per the current state. The previous move was from (6,2) to (5,2), so the body would be [(5,2), (6,2)] if the snake is length 2. But the problem states \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,2)\". So the snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Or does it have a tail segment? The board state shows the snake at (5,2) with a '2' there. The enemy snake #1 has a body at [(2,0)], so maybe each snake has a body length of 1 (head) plus any body segments. So my snake's body is just [(5,2)]? Then moving RIGHT to (6,2) would be safe, as there's no body there anymore. Wait, but the last move was LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). So the tail would have moved, so the body is only at (5,2) now. Therefore, moving RIGHT back to (6,2) is possible. But I need to confirm the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows at row 2 (y=2): A . A . . 2 . . . . \n\nSo (5,2) is where the snake is. The '2' is at (5,2). The previous position was (6,2), which is now empty because the snake moved left. So the snake's body is only at (5,2). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe because there's no body segment there anymore. \n\nNow, the apples: (2,5), (5,7), (0,2), (2,2), (7,3). The closest apples are (2,2) at x=2, y=2 (same row) and (0,2). Also, (7,3) is nearby. \n\nIf I move LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2), that's one step closer to (2,2). But (4,2) is empty. Moving LEFT again would get to (3,2), then (2,2) where there's an apple. So three moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) could head towards the apple at (5,7) or (2,5). From (5,3), moving up each time would take me to (5,4), (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) would get that apple in three moves. \n\nSo options: \n\n1. Continue left towards (2,2) apple. \n2. Move towards (7,3) apple. \n3. Go up towards (5,7) or (2,5). \n\nWhich is more efficient? \n\nThe (7,3) apple is two moves away (RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT). Wait, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Also three moves. \n\nThe (2,2) apple is three moves left from (5,2). \n\nComparing the two, (7,3) is three moves, (2,2) is three moves. But (7,3) gives a point in three moves, same as (2,2). However, moving towards (7,3) might be riskier if there's enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far away. \n\nAnother consideration: the path to (7,3) might be safer because it's in the upper right, while (2,2) is near the left edge. Also, moving left could lead to getting trapped if the enemy snake moves up. \n\nBut currently, the enemy snake is at (1,0) with a body at (2,0). They might be moving up or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) could start a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut let's check each direction's safety:\n\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,3): empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty. Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the nearest apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right and up). The apple at (0,2) is five moves left. The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. The apple at (2,5) is three moves up and three left. \n\nSo the closest are (2,2) and (7,3). \n\nWhich path is better? Let's think about possible risks. \n\nIf I go left towards (2,2), I have to move through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). No obstacles in the way. The enemy snake is at (1,0), which is two down from (2,2). So unless they move up, it's safe. \n\nIf I go right towards (7,3), I need to move right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then right to (7,3). That path is also clear. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nBut which path is shorter? Both take three moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples. For example, after getting (2,2), maybe go up to (2,3), then towards (2,5). But that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (7,3), maybe go towards (5,7). \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect the nearest apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, which is closer to the right edge. Moving right might be riskier if the snake gets trapped near the edge. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,2) is safer as it's in the middle-left area. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should prioritize the direction that allows for more flexibility. Moving left towards (2,2) allows the snake to then go up towards (2,5) or continue left to (0,2). Moving right towards (7,3) allows the snake to go up towards (5,7) or right towards the edge. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake should head towards the apple at (7,3) because it's in a different direction, avoiding potential competition with the enemy snake. \n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,0), which is far from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, since the snake is at (5,2), moving right to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) could be a path. \n\nBut the immediate move is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, I'm one step closer to (2,2). If I choose RIGHT, I'm moving towards (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (5,3) starts a path towards (5,7). \n\nBut which apple is more efficient? \n\nThe apple at (2,2) is three moves left. The apple at (7,3) is three moves (right, up, right). The apple at (5,7) is five moves up. \n\nSo (2,2) is the closest. \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,2) is the best option to get closer to the apple. \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (5,2). Moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe. Then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), then (2,2) to eat the apple. \n\nYes, that's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) would start a path towards (5,7), but that's longer. \n\nSo the optimal move is LEFT towards (4,2). \n\nCheck for any dangers: \n\n- The new position (4,2) is empty. \n- No enemy snakes are nearby. \n- The snake's body is only at (5,2), so moving to (4,2) won't collide with itself. \n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

However, moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly to an apple. \n\nMoving DOWN to (3,1) would take me away from the apples, so that's probably not ideal.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. That gives a point and extends the snake's length. After eating that apple, the next move would be from (2,2). Then possible directions would be LEFT to (1,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). But need to check for enemies. The enemy snake #1 is at (1,2), so moving LEFT from (2,2) would take me to (1,2), which is occupied by snake #1. So that's dangerous. Therefore, after eating the apple at (2,2), I should avoid moving left next turn. But for the current move, moving LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake #1's head is at (1,2) with a body at (1,1). So (1,2) is the head of snake #1. If I move to (2,2), then next move if I go left to (1,2), I would collide with snake #1's head, which is a risk. But right now, moving to (2,2) is safe because it's an apple. So the immediate move is safe. The next move after that would need to avoid snake #1's head. But that's for the next turn. For now, collect the apple.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple. That's the best option for gaining a point and growing. The other directions don't lead to immediate apples. The apple at (0,2) is further left, but after (2,2), moving left again would be risky due to the enemy. So after this move, I should plan to go up or down from (2,2) to avoid collision with snake #1. But that's for the next move. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with a body part at (1,2) and (1,1). The board shows that my snake is at (2,2), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me here.\n\nPossible directions from (2,2) are LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), UP to (2,3), or DOWN to (2,1). \n\nFirst, check each direction for safety and potential to collect apples. \n\nLEFT to (1,2): The enemy snake #1's head is at (0,2), but their body includes (1,2). Wait, the enemy positions state that snake #1 is at (0,2) with body at [(1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,2) is part of snake #1's body. Moving left to (1,2) would collide with their body, which is a death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2): That's where I was before moving left. Since the snake's body moves forward each turn, (3,2) might now be empty. But checking the board state, after moving left, the snake's body would have moved. However, the current position is (2,2), so the next segment would be where I was before. But since I just ate an apple (if the last move was to collect an apple at (2,2)), then my body would have grown. Wait, the last move was LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2). If (2,2) was an apple, then after moving there, the snake's length increases by one. So the body would now be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, the initial position was (2,2) as the head. Wait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (2,2)\". So the head is at (2,2), and the body segments would follow. But the board state shows at row 2 (y=2), positions (2,2) is snake 2, and (1,2) is snake 1's body. So after moving left to (2,2), the body would be behind. If the snake was length 1 before, moving left would make the body at (3,2). But if the snake had just eaten an apple, the body would extend. Wait, the previous move's rationale mentioned moving left to collect an apple at (2,2). So if that was the case, then after moving to (2,2), the snake's body would now be longer. But the current board state shows snake 2 at (2,2) with a '2' there. The previous position (3,2) is marked as 'T' (tail?), so maybe the snake's body is just the head at (2,2) and the tail at (3,2). So moving RIGHT back to (3,2) would collide with my own tail. Wait, the board shows at (3,2) there's a 'T', which might be the tail. So moving RIGHT to (3,2) would hit my own tail, causing death. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nUP to (2,3): Let's check what's there. The board at y=3 (row 3) shows at (2,3) a '.' which is empty. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe. From there, the next move could be towards apples like (2,5) or (5,7). Also, moving up could be a path towards those apples.\n\nDOWN to (2,1): The board at y=1 (row 1) shows (2,1) as '.', so it's empty. Moving down is safe, but takes me away from the apples. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,6) or others. But (2,1) is moving down, which is away from most apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and DOWN. Now, which direction leads towards apples. The closest apples are (2,5) which is up from (2,2). To reach (2,5), moving UP each step would get closer. So moving UP now starts heading towards that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN might not be beneficial unless there's a path to another apple, but the apples are mostly in upper rows.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (0,2) with body parts. Their head is at (0,2), so moving left from (2,2) is dangerous, but moving up or down avoids them.\n\nSo the best options are UP or DOWN. UP is towards (2,5), which is an apple. Let's plan the path. From (2,2) to (2,3) (UP), then (2,4), then (2,5). That's three moves up. But need to ensure that the path is clear. However, the enemy snake's positions don't block that path. The apple at (2,5) is present, so moving UP now starts heading there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,1) might not lead to any apples directly. The closest apple in that direction is (7,3), but that's far. So UP is better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,3) to start moving towards the apple at (2,5). This direction is safe and progresses towards an apple.\n</think>\n\nUP"

So after moving UP to (2,3), the tail would have moved from (2,2) to follow. Wait, the previous position was (2,2) as the head, then moved UP to (2,3). So the body would now be [(2,3), (2,2)] if the snake's length is 2. But if the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, the tail would have moved. Wait, the last move was UP from (2,2) to (2,3). If that move didn't collect an apple, then the tail would have moved. But the apples listed don't include (2,3), so the last move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now at (2,3) (head) and (2,2) (tail). So moving DOWN to (2,2) would collide with the tail. So DOWN is unsafe.\n\nLEFT to (1,3): Check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,3) with body parts at (0,2) and (1,2). So (1,3) is empty. Moving left to (1,3) is safe.

But need to check if the path is clear. From (2,4), next move to (2,5) would be safe unless another snake is there. Currently, no snakes are reported near (2,5).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,3) could lead towards (1,6), which is up and left. From (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6). That's three moves. But need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3) could lead towards (7,3). From (3,3), moving right each step until x=7. That's four moves right. But (7,3) is an apple.

Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nUP leads directly to (2,5) in two moves. LEFT leads towards (1,6) in three moves. RIGHT leads to (7,3) in four moves. \n\nPrioritizing the closest apple, UP is the best choice. So moving UP to (2,4) is safe and progresses towards (2,5). \n\nCheck if moving UP to (2,4) is safe.

Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) allows me to go to (1,6) next turn.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,7). Moving LEFT to (1,5) could get (1,6) next. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (0,5). If they move right, they could come towards (1,5). So moving LEFT to (1,5) might put me in their path next turn.

The (9,9) apple is very far, probably not worth it yet.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about the immediate gain. Moving UP to (2,6) doesn't get an apple now, but next move to (2,7) would. Moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,6), the next move to (2,7) would collect the apple. But need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (1,5) and then UP to (1,6) would collect that apple. Both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better because it's a direct path towards (2,7), and the enemy snake is on the left side. Maybe avoiding the left side where the enemy is might be safer. Also, moving UP keeps me in a less crowded area.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could open up more space. From there, moving towards (5,7) might be possible. But that's a longer path. However, it might be safer as it's away from the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,5).

That's a risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (2,6) might be safer. Then next turn, move UP again to (2,7) for the apple. That way, I avoid potential conflict with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,5) could be a safe path, but no immediate apple. But maybe that's a way to explore other apples.\n\nHmm. The apple at (2,7) is two steps up. If I go UP now, next turn I can get it. That's a good plan. So first move UP to (2,6), then UP again to (2,7). That's two moves for one apple. Alternatively, if I move LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) gets an apple in two moves as well. Both options give an apple in two moves, but which is safer.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT might be riskier. So perhaps UP is better.

Next move options from there would be UP (to 2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7), or DOWN (back to 2,6). Since the snake grows, the tail would extend, so moving back down next turn might not be safe if the body is there. But immediate gain is good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Collects apple here. Then next moves could be UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) (enemy's head), or RIGHT back to (2,6). Moving LEFT to (1,6) gets an apple but positions near enemy's head at (0,6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision could occur. Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** No apple, but safe. Allows movement towards other apples like (5,7) or (7,3). However, no immediate point gain.\n\nPrioritize collecting apples to gain points. Between UP and LEFT, both have apples. UP is closer (one step) and avoids proximity to enemy. LEFT gets an apple but is adjacent to enemy's current position. The enemy snake #1 is at (0,6), so moving LEFT to (1,6) is adjacent. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) next turn, collision would happen. However, in the current turn, (1,6) is safe. But considering future moves, UP might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) doesn't collect an apple but positions towards (5,7). However, delaying apple collection might allow other snakes to take them.\n\nBest immediate gain is UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). Let's check the board again. The apple at (1,6) is present, and (2,7) is also an apple. Both are valid. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position: enemy snake #1 is at (0,6). If they move RIGHT to (1,6), they could take that apple next turn. If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I secure that apple before the enemy can. However, moving UP to (2,7) is safer as it's away from the enemy's current position. \n\nSince the enemy's head is at (0,6), their possible moves are UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT (invalid, since x=0), or RIGHT to (1,6). If they choose RIGHT, they would go to (1,6). If I move LEFT to (1,6) now, I might collide with them if they also move RIGHT. But in the current turn, (1,6) is unoccupied except for the apple. So moving LEFT is safe this turn, but next turn, if the enemy moves there, I would have already collected the apple and moved on. Wait, no\u2014if I move LEFT to (1,6) this turn, I'm there now. The enemy's next move could be to (1,6), causing a collision. But in the current turn, the enemy is at (0,6), so their next move could be RIGHT to (1,6), which would be my current position if I move LEFT. That would result in a collision and death. Therefore, moving LEFT to (1,6) is risky because the enemy might move there next turn.\n\nTherefore, safer to move UP to (2,7) to collect that apple and avoid potential conflict. Additionally, after moving UP, the next move from (2,7) could be towards other apples like (5,7) or (9,9), but that's future planning. For now, secure the closest apple safely.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. Better to prioritize points.\n\nConclusion: Move UP to (2,7) to collect the apple and avoid the enemy's possible path.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (2,7) after moving UP last turn. The apples are at (5,7), (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (0,7) with body parts at [(0,6), (0,5)]. The board shows that my head is at (2,7), and there's an apple at (5,7) to the right and up. Let me check possible moves.\n\nPossible directions from (2,7) are UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nFirst, check safety for each direction:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** The cell is empty. Moving here is safe. No immediate apple, but allows movement towards the top where there's an apple at (9,9) eventually. But that's far.\n\n- **DOWN (2,6):** That's part of my body. Since I just moved UP to (2,7), the previous position was (2,6), which is now part of my body. So moving DOWN would collide with my own tail. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Check the cell. The board shows (1,7) as empty. No enemy snakes there. Safe to move. Also, moving towards the left might approach the apple at (1,6) if I go down next.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** The cell is empty. Moving right here gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **UP (2,8):** Safe, but no immediate point. Might need to plan a path towards other apples. However, moving up could lead towards (5,7) if I go right after.\n\n- **LEFT (1,7):** Safe, but the nearest apple is at (1,6) which is one cell down from (1,7). So moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) next turn would collect that apple. But need to ensure that path is safe next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT (3,7):** Moving towards (5,7). Each step right gets closer. From (3,7), next moves could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to collect the apple. This path is longer but secures a point in a few moves.\n\nAlso, check enemy positions. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,7). Their possible moves are UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,7). If they move RIGHT to (1,7), and I also move LEFT to (1,7), that would cause a collision. So moving LEFT is risky if the enemy chooses to go RIGHT. However, their current position is (0,7), so moving RIGHT would take them to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), there's a chance of collision if they do the same. Therefore, moving LEFT might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,7) avoids the enemy's possible path. The enemy is on the left edge, so they can't move left. Their possible moves are limited. If they move RIGHT to (1,7), but I'm moving RIGHT, I avoid that.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is a good target. Moving RIGHT towards it seems strategic. Alternatively, the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT might risk collision with the enemy if they move RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is far, but maybe not worth going for yet. The apple at (7,3) is lower on the board. Maybe focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,7), then (5,7) to get the apple. That's two moves to collect it. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,7) and then DOWN to (1,6) to get the apple there. But the risk of collision with the enemy's possible move to (1,7) this turn is a concern. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,7), and I move LEFT there, we collide. So that's a 50/50 chance. Maybe better to avoid that risk.\n\nTherefore, safer to move RIGHT towards (5,7) or UP to (2,8). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,7), that's a step towards the apple. No immediate points, but sets up for future gain. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,8) keeps me in a safer area, but no points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check if there's another apple path. The apple at (9,5) is on the right edge. But that's far. The apple at (7,3) is lower. Maybe after collecting (5,7), head down towards (7,3).\n\nBut for this turn, the priority is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. Since moving RIGHT is safe and progresses towards (5,7), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP is safe but doesn't collect an apple. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is three cells to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would get there. But each move needs to be safe. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). Each of these cells is currently empty. So moving RIGHT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now is better. \n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving RIGHT? The cell (3,7) is empty. The enemy snake is at (0,7), so they can't reach (3,7) in one move. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (3,7) to approach the apple at (5,7). \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,6) is closer but requires moving LEFT then DOWN. However, moving LEFT risks collision with the enemy's possible RIGHT move. Since the enemy's head is at (0,7), they can move RIGHT to (1,7). If I move LEFT to (1,7), we collide. So that's a risk. Therefore, better to avoid LEFT and go RIGHT. \n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (3,7) to safely approach the apple at (5,7).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Moving right gets me closer to the apple at (5,7). Safe direction.\n\nNow, evaluate options for points and strategy:\n\n- **RIGHT (4,7):** Closer to the apple at (5,7). Next move could be RIGHT again to (5,7) to collect the apple. This is the most direct path to gain a point quickly.\n\n- **UP (3,8):** Safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Might need to plan a path towards other apples like (9,9) or (7,3) later.\n\n- **DOWN (3,6):** Safe but moves away from the nearest apple. However, there's an apple at (1,6) which is to the left and down. But moving down here would require subsequent moves left, which might conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nCheck enemy positions: Snake #1 is at (0,8). Their possible moves are UP to (0,9), DOWN to (0,7), LEFT (invalid, x=0), or RIGHT to (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (1,8), that's not in my current path. My current position is (3,7), so their movement doesn't directly threaten me this turn.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is two cells away. Moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn would secure it. This seems optimal for gaining points quickly. \n\nAlternative options: If I move UP to (3,8), I could then move RIGHT towards (5,8) and then down to (5,7), but that's a longer path. \n\nThe apple at (1,6) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3,7 to 1,6 is 3 cells), but moving LEFT from (3,7) is unsafe (body collision), so I can't go left. To reach (1,6), I would need to go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But that path might be risky if the enemy moves into those areas. Also, the enemy's body is at (0,7) and (0,6), so they might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) as well, increasing competition.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,7) via RIGHT moves is the safest and most efficient strategy. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, then RIGHT again to (5,7) next turn to collect the apple. This path is clear and avoids collisions.\n\nAnother consideration: After collecting the apple at (5,7), the snake will grow. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead into a trapped position.

The board shows that there's an apple at (7,3), but I need to check which ones are closest.\n\nLooking at the board state, the snake's current position is (5,7). The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are in the lower right area. The closest apples might be (7,3) or (9,5), but let's check distances. From (5,7) to (7,3): that's 2 right and 4 down. To (9,5): 4 right and 2 down. Hmm, maybe (7,3) is closer in steps, but need to consider path safety.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. So their head is at (1,7), which is on the left side. They might be moving towards the apple at (1,6) or (1,9). But their current position isn't near me, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, possible directions from (5,7) are UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Moving towards (7,7), which is empty. But the apple at (7,3) is further down. Maybe not the best path yet. However, moving right could be a way to approach (7,3) by going down later.\n\n- **LEFT (4,7):** That's where my body was before. Since I moved right last turn from (4,7) to (5,7), the tail might still be at (4,7) if I didn't eat an apple. Wait, in the last move, I moved right to (5,7), which was an apple. So eating that apple would have made my snake grow. Therefore, the tail didn't move. So the body would now be [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving left to (4,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Check the board. At (5,8), the board shows row 8 (y=8) has snake #1's body parts at (1,8) and (0,8). So (5,8) is empty. Moving up is safe but doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\n- **DOWN (5,6):** The cell (5,6) is empty. Moving down here would take me towards the lower part of the board. The apple at (7,3) is in that direction. But from (5,6), next moves could be down to (5,5), then right towards (7,3). Alternatively, moving right from (5,7) to (6,7) and then down.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (5,7), moving down to (5,6) then right to (6,6), then down again, etc., could be a path. Alternatively, moving right first to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. Which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to check for any obstacles. The board shows that at (7,3) there's an apple. The path to there would need to avoid any enemy snakes or my own body.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5). From (5,7), moving right to (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc., towards (9,5). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6) is on the left side, but moving left from (5,7) is blocked by my own body. So that's not an option.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards (7,3) or (9,5). Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then from there, I can go DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT again towards (7,6), and so on. That path seems open. Alternatively, from (5,7), going DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The cell (6,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then next turn, I can decide to go DOWN or RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but that's moving away from the apple at (9,5) but closer to (7,3). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is 4 steps down and 2 steps right from (5,7). So moving down first would get me closer in the y-direction. But moving right first would get me closer in x-direction. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal path. But in snake, you can't move diagonally. So need to alternate directions.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,7) last turn, my snake's length increased. So the tail is still at the previous position. So the body parts are now [(5,7), (4,7), ...]. So moving LEFT to (4,7) is blocked by my own body. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The apples at (7,3) and (9,5) are both in the right half. (7,3) is closer in x but further in y. (9,5) is further in x but closer in y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is also present, but that's far away.\n\nSo between (7,3) and (9,5), which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo (7,3): from (5,7), need to move right 2 and down 4. Total steps: 6.\n\nTo (9,5): right 4 and down 2. Total steps: 6. Same distance.\n\nBut path safety might differ. Let's see.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next move could be RIGHT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. That path seems clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut need to check the board for any obstacles. The board shows that in row 7 (y=7), columns 6 and 7 are empty. So moving right to (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) is also safe. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can start heading towards both (7,3) and (9,5). If I go DOWN, I'm moving towards (7,3) but might have to navigate more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is easier to reach. Let's see.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (9,5): need to go right 4, down 2. So moving right first makes sense. So RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). That's 6 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving RIGHT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,5). That's 5 moves. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut the board state shows that in row 6 (y=6), there's an apple at (1,6) and a T (tail?) at (1,6). Wait, looking back at the board:\n\nThe board state as given:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: T T . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 T T T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A T . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T (maybe tail of snake 1?) at (1,6). Wait, the enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (0,8)]. So in row 6, column 1 is an apple (A) and a T. Maybe T is a tail? So that cell is occupied by a tail, so moving there would be dangerous.\n\nBut for my path, moving towards (9,5) would require moving through columns 6-9 and rows 5-7. Let's check the cells:\n\nFrom (5,7) moving right to (6,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,7): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,7): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (9,5): apple. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) moving down to (5,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (6,6): empty.\n\nThen right to (7,6): empty.\n\nThen down to (7,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (8,5): empty.\n\nThen right to (9,5): apple. That's also a safe path.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is shorter? The first path via right then down is 6 moves, the second via down then right is 5 moves. So the second path is shorter.\n\nBut to start that path, I need to move DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Then right. So moving DOWN now would initiate that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would start the other path. Which is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider if there are any apples along the way. The apple at (7,3) is on the way if I go down. But from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., could approach (7,3). But that's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,5) is more straightforward to reach.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,9) is present, but that's far away. The apple at (9,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best move now is to head towards (9,5). To do that, moving RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next move can be RIGHT again. But that's moving along the top. If I move DOWN to (5,6), then right, which is a more direct path.\n\nBut which direction is safer now?\n\nLooking at the current board, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is also safe. Both are valid.\n\nBut which path has fewer obstacles? Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 7: columns 5 is my head (2), columns 6 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nRow 6: column 5 is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. But which is better strategically?\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially reach both (9,5) and (7,3) in the future. If I move DOWN, I'm committing to a path towards (7,3) or (9,5) via a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again: (7,3), (1,6), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9). The closest in terms of steps is (9,5) and (7,3), both 6 steps. The apple at (1,6) is on the left, but moving left is blocked by my body.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to head towards (9,5) via the right path. So moving RIGHT now to (6,7), then continue right.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) and then right. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nAnother factor: after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), which is empty. Then down towards (7,5). That path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then right to (6,6), which is empty. Then right to (7,6), etc.\n\nBoth paths are viable. But perhaps moving RIGHT first allows more flexibility. For example, if I move RIGHT now, I can later choose to go down or right again. If I move DOWN, I'm closer to the lower part but might have fewer options.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,5) is in column 9, which is the right edge. Moving right now would get me closer to that edge. But the board is 10x10, so (9,5) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is in column 7, row 3. Moving down now would get me closer to that.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since both apples are equidistant, maybe prioritize the one that's easier to reach without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the path to (9,5): moving right four times and down two. The path seems clear. The path to (7,3) requires moving right two and down four. Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps (9,5) is better because after reaching it, there's another apple at (9,9) which could be the next target. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) is closer in x-direction, but further in y. But moving down four steps might take longer.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to start moving right towards (9,5). So the next move is RIGHT to (6,7).\n\nBut wait, after moving right, the next move would be to (7,7), then (8,7), etc. But after eating the apple at (9,5), the snake would grow, so need to plan the path to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,6) and then right might be safer in the long run because it's a more direct path to (9,5) with fewer turns.\n\nBut without knowing future moves, it's hard to say. For the current move, both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. But which one leads to the apple faster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, the next move can be RIGHT again, then down. That's three moves to get to (7,7), then down to (7,6), etc. To reach (9,5), that's several moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, then right, then right, then down, etc., that's also several moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is better. Let's see: from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6), then down to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then down to (7,4), then down to (7,3). That's six moves. But the apple is there.\n\nBut again, both paths are similar in steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to head towards the nearest apple in terms of steps. But since both are equidistant, maybe choose the direction that keeps more options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,7) allows me to go either right again or down next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,6) allows me to go right or down next turn. Both are flexible.\n\nBut considering the board's layout, moving RIGHT might be better because there's an apple at (9,5) and another at (9,9), which could be part of a longer-term strategy. Also, moving right now might avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake #1, which is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, moving down could avoid any potential threats from the top, but there's no immediate threat there.\n\nAnother thing to check: the enemy snake #1 is at (1,7) with body at [(1,8), (0,8)]. They are on the left side, so they might not interfere with my path to the right.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,7), heading towards the apples on the right side of the board. This direction is safe and opens up options for future moves towards either (9,5) or (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (1,6) with body parts at [(1,7), (1,8), (0,8)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check the possible directions from (6,7). The options are UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), or RIGHT (7,7). \n\nLooking at the board state:\n- UP (6,8): The row 8 (y=8) has T's (tails?) at (1,8) and (0,8), but (6,8) is empty. So moving up is safe.\n- DOWN (6,6): Row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (1,6) and a T at (1,6), but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (5,7): My previous position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail might still be there. If my body is now longer, moving left would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT (7,7): Row 7 (y=7) shows that (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards the nearest apple. The closest apples are (7,3) and (9,5). \n\nFrom (6,7), moving RIGHT to (7,7) gets me closer to (9,5). Moving DOWN to (6,6) starts heading towards (7,3). Moving UP might not be directly towards any apple but could be a detour.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), next moves could be right again towards (9,5). If I go DOWN to (6,6), I can then move right towards (7,6) and down to (7,3). \n\nConsidering the path to (9,5): from (7,7), moving right twice to (9,7), then down twice. That's 4 moves.

That's 4 moves as well. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now keeps me on a path that can reach both apples, while moving DOWN commits to (7,3). However, (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if I get trapped. \n\nAlso, enemy snake #1 is on the left, so the right side is safer. Moving RIGHT towards (9,5) seems viable. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (3,5) is in the middle. From (6,7), moving left isn't possible, but moving down and left could be a path. However, LEFT is blocked by my body. \n\nSo the best options are RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,7), next turn I can decide to go right again or down. If I move DOWN to (6,6), next turn I can go right towards (7,6). \n\nSince both paths are safe, but moving RIGHT continues the current trajectory towards (9,5), which has another apple at (9,9) nearby, I'll choose RIGHT to maintain momentum towards that area.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "Okay, let me assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (7,7). The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (9,5), (1,9), and (3,5). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with its body parts at [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)]. The board shows that at row 7 (y=7), the positions (7,7) is me (marked as 2), and there are T's (maybe tails?) around. \n\nFirst, possible directions from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- UP: (7,8). Looking at the board, row 8 has a T at (1,8) and others are empty. (7,8) seems clear. But need to check if that's a valid move. Wait, the board's state for y=8 (row 8) shows a T at (1,8) and (0,8). So (7,8) should be empty. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (7,6). Row 6 has a T at (1,6) (enemy snake's body). But (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (6,7). My previous position? Wait, from the last move info, I was at (7,7) after moving right from (6,7). If my snake has eaten an apple last move, then the tail might have extended. Wait, the last move direction was RIGHT, so if I ate an apple, the tail would stay. However, the board shows that in row 7 (y=7), positions (7,7) is me, and there's a T at (7,7)? Wait, looking at the board:\n\nThe row 7 (y=7) is: . . . T T T T 2 . . which I think corresponds to x=0 to 9. So (7,7) is position x=7, y=7, which is where I am. The T's are at x=3,4,5,6. So moving LEFT to (6,7) would be x=6, y=7. In the board, (6,7) is part of the T's (since x=6 in row 7 is marked as T). So moving LEFT would hit a tail, which is my own body part. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,7). In row 7, x=8 is empty. So it's safe. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples are at (7,3) (down), (9,9) (up-right), (9,5) (right and down), (1,9) (far left up), (3,5) (left and down). \n\nFrom (7,7), the closest apples are (9,5) and (7,3). (9,5) is two steps right and two down. (7,3) is four steps down. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), that's closer to (9,5). Next moves could be RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), but need to check for walls. (9,7) is valid, but moving DOWN from there would get me closer. Alternatively, moving down from (8,7) towards (8,6), then further down towards (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) would start heading towards (7,3). Then further down each step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might not lead directly to an apple unless I go towards (9,9), but that's a long path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's calculate steps:\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7): Right x2 to (9,7), then down y2. Total 4 moves. If apples are collected upon moving into them, then stepping on (9,5) would require moving there. But the path must avoid obstacles.\n\nPath to (7,3): From (7,7), down 4 times. But may need to maneuver around possible tails or enemies. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6) or right to (8,6). But moving left would risk entering tail areas? Wait, in row 6 (y=6), (1,6) is a T (enemy's body), but (6,6) would be empty. \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), maybe moving down to (7,5), then left/right to approach (7,3). \n\nI need to choose the safest path. The enemy snake is at (2,6) with body around (1,6-8). So the left side might be more dangerous. Moving right might be safer. \n\nAlso, considering the apple at (9,9), which is a corner, but that's far. The apple at (9,5) is closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,5) from (7,7) would require going left, but that's blocked by my tail. So that's not feasible. \n\nSo the options are between RIGHT towards (9,5) or DOWN towards (7,3). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now to (8,7) gives more space, while moving DOWN might lead into areas with possible enemy movement. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) with body parts on (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). So their head is at (2,6), and they could move in any direction except into their own body. They might move towards apples, maybe (3,5) or others. But they are on the left side, so moving right might avoid them. \n\nIf I move RIGHT, that takes me away from the enemy. \n\nBut also, after moving RIGHT, if I continue RIGHT to (9,7), then down to (9,5), that's 3 steps (including picking up the apple). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. From the current board, (9,9) is an apple, and the rest of row 9 has an apple at (9,5) and (9,9). So moving to (9,7) is safe. Then down to (9,6), (9,5) would be possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6) is safe, then to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) \u2014 three downs from (7,7). But need to check if those positions are safe. In the current board, (7,6), (7,5), etc., are empty. \n\nSo both paths are viable. Which is shorter? The path to (9,5) is 3 moves (right, right, down), but the apple is at (9,5). The path to (7,3) is 4 moves (down, down, down, down). Wait, from (7,7), down four times to (7,3). So the apple is there. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first and then down could be better. However, if I move right now, I can collect (9,5) in three moves, but if I go down, maybe I can get (7,3) in four. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving down first: from (7,7) to (7,6) (down), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). But each step needs to be valid. \n\nAlso, the apple at (9,9) is another option, but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake's potential movement. If they are moving towards apples on the left, perhaps (3,5), then the right side is safer. \n\nConsidering all this, moving RIGHT to (8,7) seems like a good step towards the (9,5) apple, which is closer. So that's the chosen direction. \n\nBut wait, need to ensure that the next move after RIGHT is possible. For example, after moving to (8,7), next move could be RIGHT to (9,7), then down. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT, maybe go down from (8,7) towards (8,6), etc. \n\nAnother possible strategy: move DOWN to (7,6), heading towards (7,3). Let's compare:\n\nRIGHT (8,7) \u2192 next move options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again to (9,7) is possible, then down to (9,6), (9,5). That's two more moves. \n\nDOWN (7,6) \u2192 next move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving down each time. \n\nWhich apple is more accessible? (7,3) is directly below, but (9,5) is farther but perhaps a straighter path. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding collision with enemy. The enemy is at (2,6), which is far from the right side, so moving right is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is RIGHT towards (9,5).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,5) with its body at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,7)]. The board shows that my position is at (8,7), and there are some T's around, which I assume are tails or body parts.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from (8,7). The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,8). Looking at the board, row 8 (y=8) seems mostly empty except for some T's at (1,8) and (0,8). (8,8) is empty, so this seems safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,6). Row 6 (y=6) has a T at (1,6) and (2,6) (enemy's head?), but (8,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,7). From the previous state, (7,7) was part of my body (marked as 2). But after moving right to (8,7), my tail might have shifted. Wait, the current board shows my snake at (8,7), so the previous position (7,7) might now be a tail. If I didn't eat an apple last move, moving left would go back into my tail. But did I eat an apple? Last move was from (7,7) to (8,7). If there was an apple at (8,7), I would have grown. But looking at the apples listed, (8,7) isn't an apple. So I didn't eat an apple, so my tail would have moved forward. Therefore, (7,7) is now part of my body. So moving LEFT to (7,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,7). The x=9 is within the board (since coordinates go up to 9). (9,7) is empty according to the board. Safe.\n\nSo possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? Let's look at the apples:\n\n- **(7,3)**: Down and left from (8,7). Requires moving down 4 times and left once. But moving left might not be safe next steps.\n- **(9,9)**: Up and right. From (8,7), moving up to (8,8), then right to (9,8), then up to (9,9). That's three moves. But (9,9) is a corner, so once there, I need to make sure I can turn without hitting walls.\n- **(9,5)**: Right and down. From (8,7), moving right to (9,7), then down to (9,6), (9,5). Two moves after RIGHT. This seems quick.\n- **(1,9)**: Far left and up. That's a long path, probably not the best option.\n- **(3,5)**: Left and down. But moving left from (8,7) is blocked by my own body, so that path is not feasible.\n\nThe closest apples are (9,5) and (9,9). Let's prioritize these. Moving RIGHT to (9,7) gets me closer to both (9,5) and (9,9). From (9,7), I can go down towards (9,5) or up towards (9,9). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,8) starts heading towards (9,9), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN to (8,6) could lead towards (7,3), but that's further away.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake positions. The enemy is at (2,5) with body parts around. They are on the left side, so moving right towards (9,5) or (9,9) keeps me away from them, reducing collision risk.\n\nAlso, the apple at (9,5) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. That's efficient. The apple at (9,9) is three moves away. Since (9,5) is closer, I should aim for that first.\n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (9,7), the next move would be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5). Both steps need to be safe. Checking the board, (9,6) and (9,5) are currently empty. The enemy snake is far away, so those positions should remain safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6) starts heading towards (7,3), but that's a longer path. However, if (9,5) is taken by another snake, but in this case, there's only one enemy snake, and they are on the left side. So (9,5) is likely safe.\n\nAnother risk: moving RIGHT to (9,7) is at the edge. If I go there, next moves have limited options. For example, from (9,7), I can only go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. But since I need to go DOWN to reach (9,5), that's manageable.\n\nConsidering all this, the best move is RIGHT towards (9,5). This path is short and avoids the enemy. \n\nWait, but what if there's a tail or obstacle at (9,7)? The current board shows row 7 (y=7) as having T's from x=3 to x=6, and my position at x=8. So (9,7) is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nSo the decision is to move RIGHT to (9,7), then proceed down towards the apple. Therefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (3,5) with a body that might be moving. The board shows my position at (9,7), and the previous move was RIGHT from (8,7) to (9,7).\n\nFirst, check possible directions from (9,7):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,8). The board shows row 8 (y=8) as mostly empty. (9,8) is safe.\n- **DOWN**: To (9,6). The board at (9,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (8,7). This was my previous position. Since I moved right last turn, my tail would have moved, so (8,7) might now be part of my body. Wait, if I didn't eat an apple last move, moving right would mean my tail moves forward. The last move was from (8,7) to (9,7). Since there's no apple at (9,7), my snake didn't grow. So the tail would have moved, making (8,7) part of the body. Therefore, moving LEFT to (8,7) would collide with my own body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Can't move right since x=9 is the maximum. So RIGHT is invalid (wall).\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN. LEFT is unsafe, RIGHT is a wall.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards apples? The closest apples are (9,9) and (9,5). \n\n- **UP** towards (9,8) gets closer to (9,9). From (9,8), next move UP to (9,9) would collect the apple. But need to check if (9,8) is safe. The board shows (9,8) as empty. So moving UP is a good path to (9,9).\n\n- **DOWN** towards (9,6) gets closer to (9,5). From (9,6), next move DOWN to (9,5) would collect that apple. (9,5) is an apple, so that's a valid path.\n\nWhich apple is better? (9,9) is two moves away (UP then UP), and (9,5) is two moves away (DOWN then DOWN). Both are equally distant. However, after collecting (9,9), the next move would be into a corner, which might limit options. Collecting (9,5) leaves more space to maneuver. \n\nAlso, considering the enemy snake at (3,5), moving towards (9,5) is safe as they are far away. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving UP to (9,8), the next move to (9,9) would require turning, but since that's the edge, after eating the apple, the snake would need to turn left or right. But since (9,9) is a corner, moving left from there would be into (8,9), which is empty. However, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail extends. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) then DOWN to (9,5) allows for possible continuation to the left towards other apples like (7,3) or (5,4). \n\nAnother point: the apple at (9,9) is in the top-right corner. If I go there, after eating, I have to move left or down. But moving left from (9,9) would be (8,9), which is empty. \n\nHmm. Both options are viable. Let's check the board again. The apple at (9,9) is present, and (9,5) is also present. \n\nSince both are two moves away, perhaps prioritize the one that allows more flexibility after collection. Moving towards (9,5) might be better because after eating, moving left towards (8,5) could lead to the apple at (5,4) next. Alternatively, moving towards (9,9) would require moving left along the top edge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,5) is safer because the enemy snake is on the left side, so staying on the right edge might be safer. \n\nGiven that, I think moving DOWN towards (9,5) is the better option. So the next move should be DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN again to (9,5) to eat the apple. \n\nTherefore, the direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The board shows (8,6) as empty. But need to check if that's part of any snake's body. Looking at the enemy snake positions, their body is at [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]. So (8,6) is clear.

From (9,5), possible directions would be UP (back to (9,6), which is part of my body after moving down), LEFT to (8,5), or DOWN to (9,4). But (9,4) is empty. However, moving DOWN from (9,5) would be possible. But eating the apple would make my tail stay, so the body would extend. So after moving DOWN to (9,5), the next move could be LEFT to (8,5) to head towards the apple at (5,4) or (7,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6) would take me towards the center. From there, maybe go towards (7,3) or (5,4). But (8,6) is safe. However, moving LEFT doesn't get me an apple immediately. \n\nSo the best immediate gain is moving DOWN to eat the apple at (9,5). That gives a point and extends the snake. The risk is that after eating, I need to avoid colliding with my own body. But since the next move after eating would be from (9,5), and the body would have grown, the tail would be at the previous end. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So after moving to (9,5), the next move's tail would be the same as before, but the head is at (9,5). So the body would be [(9,6), (9,7), ...] but depends on the previous positions. Wait, the snake's body is a list. Let me think: if the snake was at (9,6) now, and the previous positions were (9,7) before moving down. So the body is [(9,6), (9,7), ...]. If I move down to (9,5), the new body becomes [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the tail would stay where it was, but the head moves. So next turn, moving from (9,5), possible directions would be LEFT to (8,5), DOWN to (9,4), or RIGHT (invalid).

So I just ate that apple, so my snake will grow by one segment. The apples remaining are (7,3), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0), and (9,9) was already eaten? Wait, the initial list had (9,9) as an apple, but in the board state provided earlier, the top right (9,9) is marked as 'A', so maybe it's still there. Wait, the initial problem statement says apples at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0). So after moving down to (9,5), that apple is consumed, so the remaining apples are the others.\n\nNow, my snake's new position is (9,5), and the body has grown. The previous positions would be [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. Wait, the initial position before the last move was (9,6), moving down to (9,5). So the body would now be [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), ...]. So the next move needs to avoid colliding with my own body.\n\nPossible directions from (9,5):\n\n- **UP**: To (9,6). But (9,6) is part of my body now. Moving there would collide, so that's unsafe.\n- **DOWN**: To (9,4). Check if that's within the board. Y=4 is valid. Is there any obstacle? The board shows (9,4) as empty. The enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) with body parts elsewhere. So (9,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (8,5). Check the board. The board at (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Not possible, since x=9 is the maximum. So invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5).\n\nLooking at the apples remaining: (7,3), (1,9), (5,4), (8,0). The closest ones are (5,4) and (7,3). From (9,5), moving LEFT towards (8,5) would start heading towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,4) would go further down, but maybe towards the apple at (8,0) eventually.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next steps could be towards (7,5), then (7,4), etc., approaching (7,3). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) would allow me to go left towards (8,4), then (7,4), etc., but (8,0) is further down. However, (5,4) is in the middle. Let's see the positions:\n\nFrom (9,5):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,5). Then from there, possible directions would be LEFT again to (7,5), DOWN to (8,4), or UP to (8,6). Moving towards (7,5) could lead towards (7,3) apple. But that's a few moves away.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,4). Then from (9,4), possible moves LEFT to (8,4) or DOWN to (9,3). The apple at (8,0) is at y=0, so moving down further would get closer to that, but it's a long path. Alternatively, moving left from (9,4) towards (8,4) and then towards (5,4) apple.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is in the middle. So moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5) might be a better path towards (5,4). Let's plan the route:\n\nFrom (8,5), next move LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then LEFT to (5,3), then UP to (5,4) to get the apple. That's several moves, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) to get that apple. That's a shorter path. The apple at (7,3) is closer if I go down first.\n\nWait, from (9,5):\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves to reach (7,3). But moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) would also take three moves. So both paths are similar in steps.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might keep me more central, avoiding the edge. However, moving DOWN first might risk getting stuck near the bottom edge. But since the board is 10x10, moving down to (9,4) is still safe as long as there's a path back.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) with body parts. Their positions are [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. So they are in the middle-left area. If I move towards (5,4), I need to avoid their path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom edge. From (9,5), moving DOWN to (9,4), then continuing down to (9,3), (9,2), etc., could reach (8,0) eventually. But that's a long way and might not be efficient.\n\nGiven the options, moving LEFT to (8,5) seems better to start heading towards the central apples. Also, moving LEFT avoids the edge, which might be safer in case of getting trapped.\n\nBut need to check if (8,5) is safe. The board shows it as empty. Enemy snake #1 is at (5,5), so (8,5) is clear. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) is also safe. Which direction is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next turn I can go LEFT again to (7,5), then DOWN towards (7,3). That path is towards the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4) and then LEFT towards (7,3) or (5,4).\n\nHmm. Another factor: the apple at (5,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. From (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,3), UP to (5,4). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, from (9,4), moving LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), DOWN to (7,3) (apple), which is 3 moves. But (7,3) is an apple, so that's a quicker gain.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,3) is closer if I go down first. Let me see:\n\nFrom (9,5):\n\nOption 1: DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves to reach the apple.\n\nOption 2: LEFT to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). Also three moves.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving DOWN first might allow me to collect the (8,0) apple later if needed, but that's far. Alternatively, moving LEFT first keeps me more central.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's position. If enemy snake #1 is moving towards (5,5), maybe they are heading towards the (5,4) apple. So if I can reach (5,4) before them, that's good. But from my current position, it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the (7,3) apple is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nIn this case, moving LEFT to (8,5) or DOWN to (9,4) are both valid. But which is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,5), next move I can go LEFT again to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That path is clear. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me away from the edge, which can be risky if I get trapped. Edges can limit movement options. So moving towards the center might offer more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,5). This starts the journey towards the central apples and avoids potential edge traps. Next turn, I can plan to continue left or adjust direction based on the board state.\n</think>\n\nLEFT\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** Heading towards the (7,3) apple. Consider moving LEFT again if safe to approach the apple. Check for enemy snake movements."

From (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) would take four moves. But that's two apples. However, the snake can only eat one apple at a time. So maybe prioritize the closest one.\n\nSo the apple at (7,3) is two moves away if I go LEFT then DOWN twice. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) is also two moves. Wait, no: from (8,5), moving DOWN to (8,4), then LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3). That's three moves. Wait, (8,5) \u2192 DOWN to (8,4) (move 1), LEFT to (7,4) (move 2), DOWN to (7,3) (move 3). So three moves. Same as the other path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) is three moves. So same steps.\n\nBut moving LEFT first might be better because it positions me closer to other apples like (7,2) after getting (7,3). Also, moving LEFT gets me away from the edge, which is safer.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is at [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. Their head is at (5,4). So they are in the middle-left area. If I move towards (7,3), I need to avoid their path. But since they are at (5,4), moving towards (7,3) is safe as long as they don't move into that area.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT to (7,5) to start heading towards the (7,3) apple. This path is safe and leads towards an apple. Next moves can be DOWN to (7,4) and then DOWN to (7,3) to collect the apple. Additionally, after that, moving further down to (7,2) would get another apple. \n\nChecking for immediate dangers: moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. The board shows (7,5) as empty. Enemy snakes are not in that area. My own body is at (8,5), (9,5), etc., so no collision there.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (7,5).\n</think>\n\nLEFT\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** Continue towards the (7,3) apple. Consider moving DOWN next if safe to approach the apple. Monitor enemy snake #1's movements near (5,4)."

While both a RIGHT move (to (7,4)) and a DOWN move (to (6,3)) would yield a Manhattan distance of 1 to the apple, moving RIGHT puts us closer to the enemy snake\u2019s head at (8,4). To remain on the safer side and continue our planned route toward (7,3), a DOWN move is preferable. On the next turn we can then move RIGHT from (6,3) directly into the apple at (7,3).\n\nTherefore, my next move is: DOWN."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (8,4) after moving DOWN from (8,5) in the last move. The apples available are (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), and (7,2). The enemy snake #1 is at (6,4) with its body parts listed. The board shows their positions, so I need to avoid those.\n\nFirst, check possible directions from (8,4):\n- **UP**: To (8,5). But looking at the board state, (8,5) is part of my snake's body (since after moving DOWN to (8,4), the previous position was (8,5), which is now part of the body). So moving UP would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN**: To (8,3). Check the board. The board at (8,3) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (7,4). The board shows (7,4) as empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: To (9,4). The board at (9,4) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nNow, evaluate the closest apples. The apple at (7,3) is one step down and one left from (8,4). If I move LEFT to (7,4), then DOWN to (7,3) to eat the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,3), then LEFT to (7,3) would also reach the apple in two steps. \n\nAnother apple is at (7,2), which is two steps down from (8,4). Moving DOWN twice would get there. The apple at (8,0) is four steps down from (8,4), but that's a longer path. The other apples are too far.\n\nConsidering enemy snake #1's position at (6,4), moving LEFT to (7,4) brings me closer to their area, but their body is at (5,4), (5,5), etc. So (7,4) is still safe. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (7,4), next move could be DOWN to (7,3) for the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,3) allows me to go LEFT to (7,3) next. Both paths are valid. \n\nHowever, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions me closer to both (7,3) and (7,2) apples. Also, moving LEFT reduces the x-coordinate, which might help avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's path.\n\nCheck for immediate dangers: Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe. The board shows no obstacles there. Enemy snake #1 is at (6,4), which is one step left from (7,4). Wait, (6,4) is their head. So moving to (7,4) is adjacent to their head. If they move RIGHT into (7,4), that could be a collision next turn. But according to the current board, their head is at (6,4), and their body is at [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]. So their possible moves from (6,4) could be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If they move RIGHT to (7,4), that's where I'm planning to go. That's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (8,3) avoids that risk. From (8,3), I can then move LEFT to (7,3) to get the apple. This path avoids proximity to the enemy snake's head. \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (9,4) might lead towards the apple at (9,9), but that's a longer path and moving towards the edge could be risky. \n\nGiven the risk of the enemy snake moving into (7,4), it's safer to choose DOWN to (8,3). This avoids potential collision and still allows access to the apple at (7,3) next turn by moving LEFT. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,3).\n</think>\n\nDOWN\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** From (8,3), move LEFT to (7,3) to collect the apple.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (7,4) based on the updated information. The last move was LEFT, so I need to figure out the next direction. The apples are at (7,3), (9,9), (1,9), (8,0), (7,2). The enemy snake #1 is at (6,3) with body parts listed.\n\nFirst, check possible moves from (7,4):\n\n- **UP**: (7,5). Is that safe? Looking at the board state, row 5 (y=5) has some T's (maybe tails?), but (7,5) isn't listed as occupied. Wait, the board shows at row 4 (y=4) there's a 2 at (7,4), so moving UP to (7,5) would be y=5. The board's row 5 (y=5) has T's at (4,5), (3,5), etc. So (7,5) is empty. But need to check if that's part of my own body. Since my snake was at (7,4) after moving LEFT from (8,4), the previous positions would be (8,4) and (8,5) before that. So (7,5) isn't part of my body. So UP is safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: (7,3). There's an apple here! If I move DOWN, I can eat the apple and grow. But need to check if (7,3) is occupied by any other snake. The enemy snake #1 is at (6,3), which is adjacent. So (7,3) is an apple, and the board shows it as 'A'. So moving DOWN would get the apple. But wait, enemy snake #1's head is at (6,3). If I move to (7,3), that's adjacent to their head. Could they move into (7,3) next turn? But according to the rules, if two snakes move into the same spot, they both die. So if I move DOWN to (7,3) and the enemy snake moves RIGHT to (7,3), we both collide. That's risky. But maybe the enemy will avoid that. Alternatively, maybe it's worth the risk to get the apple.\n\n- **LEFT**: (6,4). Wait, the enemy snake #1's body is at (6,4) as part of their body. Wait, the enemy positions say snake #1 is at (6,3) with body parts [(6,4), (5,4), etc.]. So (6,4) is part of their body. So moving LEFT to (6,4) would collide with their body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- **RIGHT**: (8,4). Check if that's safe. My snake's previous position was (8,4) before moving LEFT to (7,4). So (8,4) is part of my body now. Moving RIGHT would go back into my own body, causing a collision. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or DOWN. \n\nIf I move UP to (7,5), that's safe. Then next turn, I can plan to go towards another apple. But moving DOWN to (7,3) gets an apple immediately. However, the risk is colliding with the enemy snake if they move into (7,3). \n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position: their head is at (6,3). Their possible moves from there are UP (to (6,4)), but (6,4) is their own body part. So they can't move UP. They can move DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), or RIGHT to (7,3). So if they choose RIGHT, they would go to (7,3), which is the same spot I'm considering. If I move DOWN, and they move RIGHT, we both die. But if they choose another direction, I can safely get the apple.\n\nIs it worth the risk? The apple is right there, and getting it would give me a point. If I avoid it, I might miss an opportunity. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,5) keeps me safe but doesn't get the apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake might not choose RIGHT because they might prioritize avoiding collision. But I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is safer. From (7,5), I can then move towards other apples like (7,2) by going down in subsequent moves. But (7,2) is two steps down from (7,5). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better despite the risk. If the enemy snake moves RIGHT, we both die, but if they don't, I gain a point. Since the enemy's head is at (6,3), their possible moves are limited. They can't go UP (body at (6,4)), so they can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If they go RIGHT to (7,3), that's where I'm going. But maybe they'll choose another direction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is trying to get the apple at (7,3) as well. So they might move RIGHT. \n\nThis is a gamble. If I take the apple, there's a 50/50 chance of collision. But if I don't, I can stay safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another path. Let's check other apples. The apple at (7,2) is two steps down from (7,4). If I move DOWN to (7,3) (apple), then next move DOWN to (7,2) (another apple). But that's if I survive. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,5), then RIGHT to (8,5), then UP to (8,6), etc., but that's not leading towards any apples quickly. \n\nHmm. The safest move is UP to (7,5), avoiding the risk. But the apple at (7,3) is tempting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake can't move RIGHT because they have a body part there. Wait, their body is [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]. So (7,3) is not part of their body. So they can move RIGHT to (7,3). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,3), and they move RIGHT, we both die. If they move another direction, I get the apple. \n\nBut since the enemy snake's head is at (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) would be a valid move for them. \n\nThis is a risky play. Maybe it's better to avoid and go UP. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is not going to move RIGHT. For example, if they move DOWN to (6,2), then I can safely take the apple. \n\nBut without knowing their next move, it's a risk. \n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize points while surviving, perhaps taking the risk to get the apple is worth it. If I die, I lose, but if I survive, I gain a point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is also trying to avoid collision. If they see that moving RIGHT would lead to a collision, they might choose another direction. \n\nBut since we can't know their strategy, it's a gamble. \n\nIn competitive Snake, sometimes taking calculated risks is necessary. Since the apple is right there, and moving DOWN gives an immediate point, I'll take the risk and move DOWN. \n\nSo the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** After eating the apple at (7,3), quickly assess enemy snake #1's next move to avoid collision. Consider moving LEFT to (6,3) if safe or continue DOWN towards (7,2)."
