There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,3). There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). There's also an enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,3), and the enemy snake is at (2,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,3).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-3| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-3| = 7 + 0 = 7\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 4, followed by (3,2) at distance 5, then (2,4) at 6, (0,3) at 7, and (2,7) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nBut wait, going down from (7,3) to (7,1): that's moving down two steps.\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so (7,1) is actually down from (7,3).\n\nBut looking at the board:\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (7,3), down to (7,2), then (7,1), then right to (8,1), then (9,1).\n\nI need to make sure that these positions are empty and safe.\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2): empty.\n\nFrom (7,2) to (7,1): empty.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (8,1): empty.\n\nFrom (8,1) to (9,1): empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,3), to (3,2): I need to move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nThat's a longer path compared to going to (9,1).\n\nWait, no. From (7,3) to (3,3) is left four steps, then down to (3,2).\n\nBut looking back, going to (9,1) is down two steps, then right two steps.\n\nWait, earlier I thought down two steps to (7,1), but looking at the board again:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1).\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nGoing to (3,2) would be left four steps to (3,3), then down to (3,2), which is five steps.\n\nSo, (9,1) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving to (9,1) first makes sense.\n\nLet me think about the path again.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (7,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (7,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (8,1)\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach move, I need to ensure that the space is empty and safe.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't hit my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, then my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nThe next closest would be (3,2), but that's quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,4), which might be easier to reach next.\n\nLet me calculate the distance from (9,1) to (2,4):\n\n|2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThat's pretty far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7) is even farther.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the next closest at |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStill quite a distance.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,4) next, but that seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cluster of apples to efficiently collect them.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are spread out:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a cluster; they're fairly\u5206\u6563.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,1), then see which apple is closest from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,1). If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).

That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

From (7,3) to (3,3) is left four steps, then down to (3,2).\n\nBut looking back, going to (9,1) is down two steps, then right two steps.\n\nWait, earlier I thought down two steps to (7,1), but looking at the board again:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1).\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nGoing to (3,2) would be left four steps to (3,3), then down to (3,2), which is five steps.\n\nSo, (9,1) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving to (9,1) first makes sense.\n\nLet me think about the path again.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n1.

RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach move, I need to ensure that the space is empty and safe.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't hit my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, then my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nThe next closest would be (3,2), but that's quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,4), which might be easier to reach next.\n\nLet me calculate the distance from (9,1) to (2,4):\n\n|2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThat's pretty far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7) is even farther.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the next closest at |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStill quite a distance.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,4) next, but that seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cluster of apples to efficiently collect them.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are spread out:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a cluster; they're fairly\u5206\u6563.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,1), then see which apple is closest from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,1). If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). There's also an enemy snake at (2,2).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 2: . . 1 A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (8,3), and the enemy snake is at (2,2).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,3).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-8| + |4-3| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-3| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 6, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,2). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,2): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,1): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,2), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), which is closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nWait, from (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should just stick to collecting the closest apple first and reassess\u4e4b\u540e.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,3). There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). There's also an enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . .

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,3).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-3| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-3| = 7 + 0 = 7\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 4, followed by (3,2) at distance 5, then (2,4) at 6, (0,3) at 7, and (2,7) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nBut wait, going down from (7,3) to (7,1): that's moving down two steps.\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so (7,1) is actually down from (7,3).\n\nBut looking at the board:\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (7,3), down to (7,2), then (7,1), then right to (8,1), then (9,1).\n\nI need to make sure that these positions are empty and safe.\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2): empty.\n\nFrom (7,2) to (7,1): empty.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (8,1): empty.\n\nFrom (8,1) to (9,1): empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,3), to (3,2): I need to move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nThat's a longer path compared to going to (9,1).\n\nWait, no. From (7,3) to (3,3) is left four steps, then down to (3,2).\n\nBut looking back, going to (9,1) is down two steps, then right two steps.\n\nWait, earlier I thought down two steps to (7,1), but looking at the board again:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1).\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nGoing to (3,2) would be left four steps to (3,3), then down to (3,2), which is five steps.\n\nSo, (9,1) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving to (9,1) first makes sense.\n\nLet me think about the path again.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (7,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (7,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (8,1)\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach move, I need to ensure that the space is empty and safe.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't hit my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, then my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nThe next closest would be (3,2), but that's quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,4), which might be easier to reach next.\n\nLet me calculate the distance from (9,1) to (2,4):\n\n|2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThat's pretty far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7) is even farther.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the next closest at |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStill quite a distance.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,4) next, but that seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cluster of apples to efficiently collect them.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are spread out:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a cluster; they're fairly\u5206\u6563.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,1), then see which apple is closest from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,1). If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

However, given its current position, it's unlikely to reach these apples before I do if I move efficiently.\n\nMy planned path to the apple at (2, 4) involves moving up twice.

But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,3), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is not an apple position; perhaps I need to check if there are any obstacles there"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

My current position is (8,3).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-8| + |4-3| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-3| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 6, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,2). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,2): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,1): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,2), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), which is closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nWait, from (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should just stick to collecting the closest apple first and reassess\u4e4b\u540e.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

This will maximize my score while keeping me at a safe distance from Snake #2.\n\nTo summarize, my next moves will be:\n- Move DOWN twice to collect the apple at (3, 2).\n- Move LEFT three times and then move UP once to collect the apple at (2, 7).\n- Move RIGHT once to position myself for the next apple.\n- Move DOWN four times to collect the apple at (3, 2) again.\n- Move RIGHT six times to collect the apple at (9, 1).\n\nNext move: DOWN.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (3, 2), move LEFT three times and then move UP once to collect the apple at (2, 7). Then, move RIGHT once, followed by moving DOWN four times to get to (3, 2) again, and finally move RIGHT six times to reach (9, 1). Keep assessing the board for any changes in the enemy snake's position and adjust the strategy accordingly to avoid collisions."

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,6). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,4) with its body at (2,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . T 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (8,6), and the enemy snake is at (3,4).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,6).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-6| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-6| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 6, followed by (1,7) at 8, then (2,7) at 7, then (3,2) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 11.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (3,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,6), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,5): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,4): empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (1,7), but that's quite a distance away: |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(3,2) is |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nWait, actually, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the path to (3,2) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move UP to (8,3)\n\n- Move UP to (8,4)\n\n- Move UP to (8,5)\n\n- Move UP to (8,6)\n\n- Move UP to (8,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat seems too long and convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves: 1 left, 1 up, 5 lefts.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is clear.\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n1. LEFT to (8,1): empty\n\n2. UP to (8,2): empty\n\n3. LEFT to (7,2): empty\n\n4. LEFT to (6,2): empty\n\n5. LEFT to (5,2): empty\n\n6. LEFT to (4,2): empty\n\n7. LEFT to (3,2): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow again, so I need to ensure I have space.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (2,7), which is |2-3| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move UP to (3,3)\n\n- Move UP to (3,4)\n\n- Move UP to (3,5)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them.

My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,3), to (3,2): I need to move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nThat's a longer path compared to going to (9,1).\n\nWait, no. From (7,3) to (3,3) is left four steps, then down to (3,2).\n\nBut looking back, going to (9,1) is down two steps, then right two steps.\n\nWait, earlier I thought down two steps to (7,1), but looking at the board again:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1).\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nGoing to (3,2) would be left four steps to (3,3), then down to (3,2), which is five steps.\n\nSo, (9,1) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving to (9,1) first makes sense.\n\nLet me think about the path again.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n1.

RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach move, I need to ensure that the space is empty and safe.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't hit my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, then my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nThe next closest would be (3,2), but that's quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,4), which might be easier to reach next.\n\nLet me calculate the distance from (9,1) to (2,4):\n\n|2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThat's pretty far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7) is even farther.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the next closest at |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStill quite a distance.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,4) next, but that seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cluster of apples to efficiently collect them.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are spread out:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a cluster; they're fairly\u5206\u6563.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,1), then see which apple is closest from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,1). If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them.

DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 3: A . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (8,5), and the enemy snake is at (2,4).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 5, followed by (3,2) and (2,7) at 8, then (1,7) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,5), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,4): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(1,7) is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n4. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n5. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4):\n\n- Ensure (8,4) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,4). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,7).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,7):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to"

Enemy snake is at (4,4), which is along my path.\n\nI need to see if the enemy snake will be moving towards me.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake moves towards its own food, and without knowing its food positions, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nHowever, to be safe, I should consider that the enemy snake might move towards me.\n\nIf I move left to (6,6), and the enemy snake moves up to (4,5), it's still not a direct threat.\n\nContinuing left to (5,6), then (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6), and finally up to (2,7).\n\nI need to ensure that by the time I reach (2,6), the enemy snake is not at (2,6) or blocking my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (4,4), it would take several moves for it to reach (2,6), and I should be able to reach the apple before it gets there.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (2,7), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (2,7), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (2,7), the next closest apple is (1,7), which is |1-2| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nSo, after eating (2,7), I can immediately move left to (1,7) and eat that apple.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (3,2) is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nWait, (0,3) is closer than (3,2).\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- (0,3): |0-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (3,2): |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (9,1): |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (0,3) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (1,7), moving down to (1,6), then left to (0,6), then down to (0,5), then down to (0,4), then down to (0,3).\n\nThat's 4 moves: DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is clear.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n1. DOWN to (1,6): empty\n\n2. LEFT to (0,6): empty\n\n3. DOWN to (0,5): empty\n\n4. DOWN to (0,4): empty\n\n5. DOWN to (0,3): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (0,3), my tail will grow again, so I need to ensure I have space.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (3,2), which is |3-0| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 3 rights and 1 down.\n\nBut looking at the board, there might be a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,6)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nWait, that seems longer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can move RIGHT to (1,3), then UP to (1,4), then RIGHT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5), then RIGHT to (3,5), then DOWN to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), then DOWN to (3,2).\n\nThat's too many moves.\n\nI think the first path is better: RIGHT to (1,3), RIGHT to (2,3), RIGHT to (3,3), DOWN to (3,2).\n\nThat's 3 rights and 1 down.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3): empty\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3): empty\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3): empty\n\n- DOWN to (3,2): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,2).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . .

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,3).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-8| + |4-3| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-3| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 6, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,2). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,2): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,1): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,2), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), which is closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nWait, from (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should just stick to collecting the closest apple first and reassess\u4e4b\u540e.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n4. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n5. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4):\n\n- Ensure (8,4) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,4). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,7).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,7):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to"

There's also an enemy snake at (3,4) with its body at (2,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

There's also an enemy snake at (4,5) with its body at (4,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . .

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-7| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 6, followed by (2,7) and (1,7) at 7, then (3,2) at 7, and finally (0,3) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (4,5). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,5), to get to (9,1), I need to go right to (9,5), then down to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (7,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (8,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,5)\n\n- DOWN to (9,4)\n\n- DOWN to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,5): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (9,5): empty.\n\n- (9,4): empty.\n\n- (9,3): empty.\n\n- (9,2): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (4,5), which is along my path.\n\nI need to see if the enemy snake will be moving towards me.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake moves towards its own food, and without knowing its food positions, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nHowever, to be safe, I should consider that the enemy snake might move towards me.\n\nIf I move right to (8,5), and the enemy snake moves right to (5,5), it's still not a direct threat.\n\nContinuing right to (9,5), then down to (9,4), etc., the enemy snake would have to move significantly to intercept me.\n\nGiven that, I think it's safe to proceed towards (9,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (1,7), which is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(3,2) is |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then left to (7,2), then left to (6,2), then left to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nThat's 1 up and 6 lefts.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is clear.\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n1. UP to (9,2): empty\n\n2. LEFT to (8,2): empty\n\n3. LEFT to (7,2): empty\n\n4. LEFT to (6,2): empty\n\n5. LEFT to (5,2): empty\n\n6. LEFT to (4,2): empty\n\n7. LEFT to (3,2): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow again, so I need to ensure I have space.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- Move UP to (0,3)\n\nThat's 3 lefts and 1 up.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2): empty\n\n- LEFT to (1,2): empty\n\n- LEFT to (0,2): empty\n\n- UP to (0,3): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (0,3), my tail will grow again.\n\nThen, the next closest apple is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,7)\n\nThat's 1 right and 4 ups.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3): empty\n\n- UP to (1,4): empty\n\n- UP to (1,5): empty\n\n- UP to (1,6): empty\n\n- UP to (1,7): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,7), my tail will grow again.\n\nThen, the last apple is at (2,7), which is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,7): that's the apple\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (2,7), my tail will grow again.\n\nAt this point, all apples are collected, and I need to just make sure I don't hit anything.\n\nSo, overall plan:\n\n1. Move towards (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (8,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,5)\n\n- DOWN to (9,4)\n\n- DOWN to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1) [eat apple]\n\n2. Move towards (3,2):\n\n- UP to (9,2)\n\n- LEFT to (8,2)\n\n- LEFT to (7,2)\n\n- LEFT to (6,2)\n\n- LEFT to (5,2)"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . .

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them.

Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,3), to (3,2): I need to move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nThat's a longer path compared to going to (9,1).\n\nWait, no. From (7,3) to (3,3) is left four steps, then down to (3,2).\n\nBut looking back, going to (9,1) is down two steps, then right two steps.\n\nWait, earlier I thought down two steps to (7,1), but looking at the board again:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1).\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nGoing to (3,2) would be left four steps to (3,3), then down to (3,2), which is five steps.\n\nSo, (9,1) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving to (9,1) first makes sense.\n\nLet me think about the path again.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n1.

RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach move, I need to ensure that the space is empty and safe.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't hit my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, then my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nThe next closest would be (3,2), but that's quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,4), which might be easier to reach next.\n\nLet me calculate the distance from (9,1) to (2,4):\n\n|2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThat's pretty far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7) is even farther.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the next closest at |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStill quite a distance.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,4) next, but that seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cluster of apples to efficiently collect them.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are spread out:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a cluster; they're fairly\u5206\u6563.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,1), then see which apple is closest from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,1). If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity.

DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 3: A . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (8,5), and the enemy snake is at (2,4).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 5, followed by (3,2) and (2,7) at 8, then (1,7) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,5), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,4): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(1,7) is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n4. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n5. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4):\n\n- Ensure (8,4) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,4). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,7).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,7):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity.

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,6).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-6| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-6| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 6, followed by (1,7) at 8, then (2,7) at 7, then (3,2) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 11.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (3,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,6), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,5): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,4): empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (1,7), but that's quite a distance away: |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(3,2) is |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nWait, actually, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the path to (3,2) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move UP to (8,3)\n\n- Move UP to (8,4)\n\n- Move UP to (8,5)\n\n- Move UP to (8,6)\n\n- Move UP to (8,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat seems too long and convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves: 1 left, 1 up, 5 lefts.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is clear.\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n1. LEFT to (8,1): empty\n\n2. UP to (8,2): empty\n\n3. LEFT to (7,2): empty\n\n4. LEFT to (6,2): empty\n\n5. LEFT to (5,2): empty\n\n6. LEFT to (4,2): empty\n\n7. LEFT to (3,2): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow again, so I need to ensure I have space.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (2,7), which is |2-3| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move UP to (3,3)\n\n- Move UP to (3,4)\n\n- Move UP to (3,5)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2"

My initial plan was to move UP to collect the apples at (2, 4) and (2, 7), but since I have moved RIGHT, I need to reassess the situation.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3, 2), which I previously planned to collect after the apple at (2, 7).

To do so, I should move LEFT once and then move DOWN twice.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 2), I will need to decide my next move.

But that's even longer.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's easier to reach.\n\nLet's look at (1,7). It's also relatively close, with a distance of 6.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nAgain, the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, go up to (6,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nAgain, passing through (4,7), which is risky.\n\nThis isn't looking good.

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity.

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,6).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-6| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-6| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 6, followed by (1,7) at 8, then (2,7) at 7, then (3,2) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 11.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (3,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,6), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,5): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,4): empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (1,7), but that's quite a distance away: |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(3,2) is |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nWait, actually, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the path to (3,2) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move UP to (8,3)\n\n- Move UP to (8,4)\n\n- Move UP to (8,5)\n\n- Move UP to (8,6)\n\n- Move UP to (8,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat seems too long and convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves: 1 left, 1 up, 5 lefts.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is clear.\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n1. LEFT to (8,1): empty\n\n2. UP to (8,2): empty\n\n3. LEFT to (7,2): empty\n\n4. LEFT to (6,2): empty\n\n5. LEFT to (5,2): empty\n\n6. LEFT to (4,2): empty\n\n7. LEFT to (3,2): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow again, so I need to ensure I have space.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (2,7), which is |2-3| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move UP to (3,3)\n\n- Move UP to (3,4)\n\n- Move UP to (3,5)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2"

My initial plan was to move UP to collect the apples at (2, 4) and (2, 7), but since I have moved RIGHT, I need to reassess the situation.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3, 2), which I previously planned to collect after the apple at (2, 7).

To do so, I should move LEFT once and then move DOWN twice.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 2), I will need to decide my next move.

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (6,5). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,7) with its body at (4,7).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . A A 1 T . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . 2 . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (6,5), and the enemy snake is at (3,7) with its body at (4,7).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (6,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-6| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-6| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSo the closest apples are at (2,7) and (3,2), both with a distance of 6.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,7) with its body at (4,7). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first.\n\nFrom (6,5), to get to (2,7), I can:\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nThis path isn't safe because it goes through the enemy snake's body and head.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nAgain, this path leads me to the enemy snake's head.\n\nAnother option is to move down first to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- Move UP to (2,5)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,7)\n\nThis path seems longer but avoids the enemy snake. However, it's 8 steps, which is more than the initial 6 steps.\n\nLet me check the other closest apple at (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path is 6 steps and doesn't seem to intersect with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- Move UP to (0,3)\n\nThis path looks clear.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,7)\n\nThis path also seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat's a long way. I need to make sure I have a clear path or consider if it's worth going for it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the closer apples first and then go for the farther ones.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake is at (3,7) and its body is at (4,7), it might be moving in a certain direction.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement to avoid collision.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy snake's direction, it's hard to predict its next moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (3,2) first, as it seems more accessible without interfering with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (6,5) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nBut going to (9,1) from (2,7) is a long journey. Maybe I should consider eating another apple first if it's closer.\n\nWait, perhaps after (2,7), I can go to (9,1), but that's a long way. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Go to (3,2)\n\n2. Then to (0,3)\n\n3. Then to (1,7)\n\n4. Then to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, to (9,1)\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nNow, focusing on the first step: moving from (6,5) to (3,2).\n\nPath:\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . .

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them.

My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,3), to (3,2): I need to move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nThat's a longer path compared to going to (9,1).\n\nWait, no. From (7,3) to (3,3) is left four steps, then down to (3,2).\n\nBut looking back, going to (9,1) is down two steps, then right two steps.\n\nWait, earlier I thought down two steps to (7,1), but looking at the board again:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1).\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nGoing to (3,2) would be left four steps to (3,3), then down to (3,2), which is five steps.\n\nSo, (9,1) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving to (9,1) first makes sense.\n\nLet me think about the path again.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (7,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (7,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (8,1)\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach move, I need to ensure that the space is empty and safe.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't hit my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, then my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nThe next closest would be (3,2), but that's quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,4), which might be easier to reach next.\n\nLet me calculate the distance from (9,1) to (2,4):\n\n|2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThat's pretty far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7) is even farther.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the next closest at |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStill quite a distance.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,4) next, but that seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cluster of apples to efficiently collect them.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are spread out:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a cluster; they're fairly\u5206\u6563.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,1), then see which apple is closest from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,1). If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity.

Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), which is closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nWait, from (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently.

DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 5, followed by (3,2) and (2,7) at 8, then (1,7) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,5), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,4): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(1,7) is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n4. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n5. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4):\n\n- Ensure (8,4) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,4). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,7).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,7):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to"

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (6,6). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (4,7) with its body at (4,6).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . A A . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . T . 2 . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (6,6), and the enemy snake is at (4,7) with its body at (4,6).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (6,6).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |2-6| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo the closest apples are at (2,7) with a distance of 5, followed by (1,7) at 6, then (3,2) at 7, (9,1) at 8, and (0,3) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (4,7) with its body at (4,6). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first since it's the closest.\n\nFrom (6,6), to get to (2,7), I need to go left to (2,6), then up to (2,7).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving up means increasing Y.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nSo, moving left to (4,6) is not possible because it's occupied.\n\nAlternatively, I can go up to (6,7), then left to (2,7), but that's farther.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\nBut moving to (4,7) is adjacent to the enemy snake's head, which might be dangerous if it moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe go up to (6,7), then up to (6,8), then left to (2,8), then down to (2,7). But that's even longer.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's easier to reach.\n\nLet's look at (1,7). It's also relatively close, with a distance of 6.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nAgain, the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, go up to (6,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nAgain, passing through (4,7), which is risky.\n\nThis isn't looking good. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet's look at (3,2), which is at a distance of 7.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path seems clear. Let's check:\n\n- (6,5): empty\n\n- (6,4): empty\n\n- (6,3): empty\n\n- (5,3): empty\n\n- (4,3): empty\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nGood, no obstacles here.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable, but it's far. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the order based on proximity after each move.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming. Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Move from (6,6) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nWait, that's a long path. Maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nAlternatively, after (2,7), maybe go directly to (9,1).\n\nFrom (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,7)\n\n- DOWN to (9,6)\n\n- DOWN to (9,5)\n\n- DOWN to (9,4)\n\n- DOWN to (9,3"

I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (5,5) to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n2. Then from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n3. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n4. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (1,7) to (9,1):\n\nThis is a long way. I"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,2).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . .

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,3).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-8| + |4-3| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-3| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 6, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,2). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,2): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,1): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,2), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), which is closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nWait, from (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should just stick to collecting the closest apple first and reassess\u4e4b\u540e.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n4. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n5. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4):\n\n- Ensure (8,4) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,4). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,7).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,7):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to"

There's also an enemy snake at (3,4) with its body at (2,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1.

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (6,5). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,7) with its body at (4,7).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . A A 1 T . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . 2 . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (6,5), and the enemy snake is at (3,7) with its body at (4,7).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (6,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-6| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-6| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSo the closest apples are at (2,7) and (3,2), both with a distance of 6.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,7) with its body at (4,7). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first.\n\nFrom (6,5), to get to (2,7), I can:\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nThis path isn't safe because it goes through the enemy snake's body and head.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nAgain, this path leads me to the enemy snake's head.\n\nAnother option is to move down first to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- Move UP to (2,5)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,7)\n\nThis path seems longer but avoids the enemy snake. However, it's 8 steps, which is more than the initial 6 steps.\n\nLet me check the other closest apple at (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path is 6 steps and doesn't seem to intersect with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- Move UP to (0,3)\n\nThis path looks clear.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,7)\n\nThis path also seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat's a long way. I need to make sure I have a clear path or consider if it's worth going for it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the closer apples first and then go for the farther ones.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake is at (3,7) and its body is at (4,7), it might be moving in a certain direction.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement to avoid collision.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy snake's direction, it's hard to predict its next moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (3,2) first, as it seems more accessible without interfering with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (6,5) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nBut going to (9,1) from (2,7) is a long journey. Maybe I should consider eating another apple first if it's closer.\n\nWait, perhaps after (2,7), I can go to (9,1), but that's a long way. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Go to (3,2)\n\n2. Then to (0,3)\n\n3. Then to (1,7)\n\n4. Then to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, to (9,1)\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nNow, focusing on the first step: moving from (6,5) to (3,2).\n\nPath:\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, my snake is at position (5,5). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1.

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, my snake is at position (5,6). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with its body at (3,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-6| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-6| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 2 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with body at (3,6). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 6: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (3,6). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is empty too, since the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (3,6). So, moving left to (1,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThis is a long path, but if I can manage to eat all the apples without dying, I should be fine.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own body. So, I need to plan paths that don't cross over where I've already been.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movements. Although right now it's at (2,6) and (3,6), it can move around, so I need to keep an eye on its position as the game progresses.\n\nFor now, since it's not in my immediate path, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move RIGHT to (6,6), heading towards the apple at (6,7).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . .

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity.

Enemy snake is at (2,2). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,2): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,1): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,2), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), which is closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nWait, from (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated.

If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

My current position is (8,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 5, followed by (3,2) and (2,7) at 8, then (1,7) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,5), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,4): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(1,7) is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n4. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n5. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4):\n\n- Ensure (8,4) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,4). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,7).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,7):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to"

A A . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . T . 2 . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (6,6), and the enemy snake is at (4,7) with its body at (4,6).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (6,6).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |2-6| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo the closest apples are at (2,7) with a distance of 5, followed by (1,7) at 6, then (3,2) at 7, (9,1) at 8, and (0,3) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (4,7) with its body at (4,6). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first since it's the closest.\n\nFrom (6,6), to get to (2,7), I need to go left to (2,6), then up to (2,7).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving up means increasing Y.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nSo, moving left to (4,6) is not possible because it's occupied.\n\nAlternatively, I can go up to (6,7), then left to (2,7), but that's farther.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\nBut moving to (4,7) is adjacent to the enemy snake's head, which might be dangerous if it moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe go up to (6,7), then up to (6,8), then left to (2,8), then down to (2,7). But that's even longer.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's easier to reach.\n\nLet's look at (1,7). It's also relatively close, with a distance of 6.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nAgain, the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, go up to (6,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nAgain, passing through (4,7), which is risky.\n\nThis isn't looking good. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet's look at (3,2), which is at a distance of 7.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path seems clear. Let's check:\n\n- (6,5): empty\n\n- (6,4): empty\n\n- (6,3): empty\n\n- (5,3): empty\n\n- (4,3): empty\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nGood, no obstacles here.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable, but it's far. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the order based on proximity after each move.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming. Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Move from (6,6) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nWait, that's a long path. Maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nAlternatively, after (2,7), maybe go directly to (9,1).\n\nFrom (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,7)\n\n- DOWN to (9,6)\n\n- DOWN to (9,5)\n\n- DOWN to (9,4)\n\n- DOWN to (9,3"

I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first.\n\nFrom (6,5), to get to (2,7), I can:\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nThis path isn't safe because it goes through the enemy snake's body and head.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nAgain, this path leads me to the enemy snake's head.\n\nAnother option is to move down first to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- Move UP to (2,5)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,7)\n\nThis path seems longer but avoids the enemy snake.

Maybe I should consider eating another apple first if it's closer.\n\nWait, perhaps after (2,7), I can go to (9,1), but that's a long way. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Go to (3,2)\n\n2. Then to (0,3)\n\n3. Then to (1,7)\n\n4. Then to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, to (9,1)\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nNow, focusing on the first step: moving from (6,5) to (3,2).\n\nPath:\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (5,5) to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n2. Then from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n3. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n4. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (1,7) to (9,1):\n\nThis is a long way. I"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with its body at (3,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-6| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-6| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 2 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with body at (3,6). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 6: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (3,6). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7).

So, moving left to (1,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThis is a long path, but if I can manage to eat all the apples without dying, I should be fine.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own body. So, I need to plan paths that don't cross over where I've already been.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movements. Although right now it's at (2,6) and (3,6), it can move around, so I need to keep an eye on its position as the game progresses.\n\nFor now, since it's not in my immediate path, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move RIGHT to (6,6), heading towards the apple at (6,7).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

I need to consider that.\n\nBut for now, assuming the enemy snake doesn't move in a way that blocks my path completely, I can plan to go to (1,7) and then adjust if necessary.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path.

But I can't predict its movement for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (1,7) again. If I go to (6,7), then left to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), and (2,7) is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,7) by going down to (1,7).

It's longer, but it avoids the potential block at (2,7).\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake will move in a way that blocks my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). It's at a distance of |6-3| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps.\n\nThat's farther than going to (1,7), which is only 5 steps.

Maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). To get from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAlso 8 moves.\n\nComparing the two paths, going left to (3,7) and then down to (3,2) seems similar in length to going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (2,7), it might be safer to avoid the area around x=2.\n\nSo, maybe going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2) is a better option.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (0,3), then to (9,1).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. From (6,6), UP to (6,7) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, DOWN to (6,6), since I can't go left to (5,7) directly due to the enemy snake potentially blocking (2"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . .

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,4).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (2,4): |2-8| + |4-4| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-4| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-4| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-4| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 4, followed by (3,2) at distance 7, then (2,4) at 6, and (0,3) and (2,7) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,3). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,4), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,3): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,3), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should just stick to collecting the closest apple first and reassess\u4e4b\u540e.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,3). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,3), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block.

I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,6), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,5): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,4): empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (1,7), but that's quite a distance away: |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(3,2) is |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nWait, actually, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the path to (3,2) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move UP to (8,3)\n\n- Move UP to (8,4)\n\n- Move UP to (8,5)\n\n- Move UP to (8,6)\n\n- Move UP to (8,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat seems too long and convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves: 1 left, 1 up, 5 lefts.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is clear.\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n1.

But that's even longer.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's easier to reach.\n\nLet's look at (1,7). It's also relatively close, with a distance of 6.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nAgain, the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, go up to (6,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nAgain, passing through (4,7), which is risky.\n\nThis isn't looking good.

However, it's 8 steps, which is more than the initial 6 steps.\n\nLet me check the other closest apple at (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path is 6 steps and doesn't seem to intersect with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- Move UP to (0,3)\n\nThis path looks clear.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,7)\n\nThis path also seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat's a long way. I need to make sure I have a clear path or consider if it's worth going for it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the closer apples first and then go for the farther ones.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake is at (3,7) and its body is at (4,7), it might be moving in a certain direction.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement to avoid collision.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy snake's direction, it's hard to predict its next moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (3,2) first, as it seems more accessible without interfering with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (6,5) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nBut going to (9,1) from (2,7) is a long journey. Maybe I should consider eating another apple first if it's closer.\n\nWait, perhaps after (2,7), I can go to (9,1), but that's a long way. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Go to (3,2)\n\n2. Then to (0,3)\n\n3. Then to (1,7)\n\n4. Then to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, to (9,1)\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nNow, focusing on the first step: moving from (6,5) to (3,2).\n\nPath:\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, my snake is at position (5,5). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (5,5) to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n2. Then from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n3. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n4. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (1,7) to (9,1):\n\nThis is a long way. I"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,5) with its body at (2,6) and (2,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (6,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-6| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 1 step away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,5) with body at (2,6) and (2,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is part of the enemy snake's body. Wait, the enemy snake is at (2,5) with body at (2,6) and (2,7). So, (2,7) is occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nHmm, that could be a problem. If the enemy snake moves, (2,7) might be free, or it might not. I need to consider that.\n\nBut for now, assuming the enemy snake doesn't move in a way that blocks my path completely, I can plan to go to (1,7) and then adjust if necessary.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7) - but (2,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I need to consider if it will move.\n\nIf the enemy snake moves down from (2,7) to (2,6), then (2,7) would be free. But I can't predict its movement for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (1,7) again. If I go to (6,7), then left to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), and (2,7) is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,7) by going down to (1,7). Wait, no, I'm at (6,7), and (1,7) is to the left. But (2,7) is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go down to (6,6), then left to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), and then up to (1,7). But that's a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (2,6)\n\n- LEFT to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nThat's 7 moves instead of 5. It's longer, but it avoids the potential block at (2,7).\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake will move in a way that blocks my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). It's at a distance of |6-3| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps.\n\nThat's farther than going to (1,7), which is only 5 steps. So, maybe it's better to go for (1,7) first, despite the potential block.\n\nWait, but if I go for (1,7), and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (2,6), moving left to (2,7) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go up from (6,7) to (6,8), then left to (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), and then down to (1,7).\n\nThat's another way to reach (1,7) without passing through (2,7).\n\nBut that's even longer, at 8 moves.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). To get from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAlso 8 moves.\n\nComparing the two paths, going left to (3,7) and then down to (3,2) seems similar in length to going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (2,7), it might be safer to avoid the area around x=2.\n\nSo, maybe going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2) is a better option.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (0,3), then to (9,1).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. From (6,6), UP to (6,7) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, DOWN to (6,6), since I can't go left to (5,7) directly due to the enemy snake potentially blocking (2"

Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (5,6), but according to the board, I'm at (6,6). So, I'm at (6,6).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7).

Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6).

From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is part of the enemy snake's body. Wait, the enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (2,7) is not occupied by the enemy snake currently.\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says the enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (2,7) is not part of its body now. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nSo, if I move left from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), and (1,7), and (2,7) is not occupied, that should be fine.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake moves. If it moves down to (2,5), then (2,6) would be free, and (2,7) would still be free.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't occupy (2,7), I can proceed left to (1,7).\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path.

Enemy snake moves left to (1,4), body at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\n2. Enemy snake moves right to (3,4), body at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn the first scenario, if the enemy snake moves left to (1,4), its body would be at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIn the second scenario, if it moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn either case, positions (1,5), (1,6), (3,5), and (3,6) would be occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking back at my planned path:\n\nFrom (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7)\n\nThis path avoids the enemy snake's possible positions.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2)\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6), which"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity.

Enemy snake is at (2,1).

If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently.

RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,4).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (2,4): |2-8| + |4-4| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-4| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-4| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-4| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 4, followed by (3,2) at distance 7, then (2,4) at 6, and (0,3) and (2,7) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,3). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,4), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,3): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,3), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should just stick to collecting the closest apple first and reassess\u4e4b\u540e.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,3). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,3), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is not an apple position; perhaps I need to check if there are any obstacles there"

This is a straight vertical line of apples, and collecting them will maximize my score quickly without putting me at immediate risk of collision.\n\nThe enemy snake (Snake #2) is currently at (8, 5) and has an empty body, which means it cannot reach the apples at (2, 4) or (2, 7) before I do.

But that's even longer.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's easier to reach.\n\nLet's look at (1,7). It's also relatively close, with a distance of 6.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nAgain, the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, go up to (6,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nAgain, passing through (4,7), which is risky.\n\nThis isn't looking good.

However, it's 8 steps, which is more than the initial 6 steps.\n\nLet me check the other closest apple at (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path is 6 steps and doesn't seem to intersect with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- Move UP to (0,3)\n\nThis path looks clear.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,7)\n\nThis path also seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat's a long way. I need to make sure I have a clear path or consider if it's worth going for it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the closer apples first and then go for the farther ones.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake is at (3,7) and its body is at (4,7), it might be moving in a certain direction.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement to avoid collision.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy snake's direction, it's hard to predict its next moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (3,2) first, as it seems more accessible without interfering with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (6,5) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nBut going to (9,1) from (2,7) is a long journey. Maybe I should consider eating another apple first if it's closer.\n\nWait, perhaps after (2,7), I can go to (9,1), but that's a long way. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Go to (3,2)\n\n2. Then to (0,3)\n\n3. Then to (1,7)\n\n4. Then to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, to (9,1)\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nNow, focusing on the first step: moving from (6,5) to (3,2).\n\nPath:\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, my snake is at position (5,5). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (5,5) to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n2. Then from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n3. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n4. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (1,7) to (9,1):\n\nThis is a long way. I"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,5) with its body at (2,6) and (2,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (6,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-6| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 1 step away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,5) with body at (2,6) and (2,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is part of the enemy snake's body. Wait, the enemy snake is at (2,5) with body at (2,6) and (2,7). So, (2,7) is occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nHmm, that could be a problem. If the enemy snake moves, (2,7) might be free, or it might not. I need to consider that.\n\nBut for now, assuming the enemy snake doesn't move in a way that blocks my path completely, I can plan to go to (1,7) and then adjust if necessary.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7) - but (2,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I need to consider if it will move.\n\nIf the enemy snake moves down from (2,7) to (2,6), then (2,7) would be free. But I can't predict its movement for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (1,7) again. If I go to (6,7), then left to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), and (2,7) is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,7) by going down to (1,7). Wait, no, I'm at (6,7), and (1,7) is to the left. But (2,7) is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go down to (6,6), then left to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), and then up to (1,7). But that's a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (2,6)\n\n- LEFT to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nThat's 7 moves instead of 5. It's longer, but it avoids the potential block at (2,7).\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake will move in a way that blocks my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). It's at a distance of |6-3| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps.\n\nThat's farther than going to (1,7), which is only 5 steps. So, maybe it's better to go for (1,7) first, despite the potential block.\n\nWait, but if I go for (1,7), and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (2,6), moving left to (2,7) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go up from (6,7) to (6,8), then left to (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), and then down to (1,7).\n\nThat's another way to reach (1,7) without passing through (2,7).\n\nBut that's even longer, at 8 moves.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). To get from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAlso 8 moves.\n\nComparing the two paths, going left to (3,7) and then down to (3,2) seems similar in length to going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (2,7), it might be safer to avoid the area around x=2.\n\nSo, maybe going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2) is a better option.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (0,3), then to (9,1).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. From (6,6), UP to (6,7) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, DOWN to (6,6), since I can't go left to (5,7) directly due to the enemy snake potentially blocking (2"

So, it's vertical, with head at (2,4), and body going up to (2,6).\n\nI need to predict where it might move.\n\nIf it moves up, it would go to (2,3), then (2,2), and so on.\n\nIf it moves down, it would go to (2,5), which is already occupied by its body, so it can't.\n\nWait, no, snakes can move in any direction, as long as they don't collide with themselves or walls.\n\nBut in this case, its body is at (2,5) and (2,6), so if it moves down from (2,4) to (2,5), it would be illegal because (2,5) is already occupied by its own body.\n\nSo, it can only move left or right from (2,4).\n\nIf it moves left to (1,4), then its body would follow to (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIf it moves right to (3,4), then its body would follow to (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nI need to consider these possible movements and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Enemy snake moves left to (1,4), body at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\n2. Enemy snake moves right to (3,4), body at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn the first scenario, if the enemy snake moves left to (1,4), its body would be at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIn the second scenario, if it moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn either case, positions (1,5), (1,6), (3,5), and (3,6) would be occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking back at my planned path:\n\nFrom (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7)\n\nThis path avoids the enemy snake's possible positions.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2)\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6), which are on my path.\n\nSo, I need to adjust my path to avoid these positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a different route to (3,2) that doesn't go through (3,6"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

Snake #2 is at (8, 3) and could potentially move towards the apples at (2, 4) or (2, 7). However, given its current position, it's unlikely to reach these apples before I do if I move efficiently.\n\nMy planned path to the apple at (2, 4) involves moving up twice. This path does not put me in immediate danger of collision with the enemy snake. After collecting the apple at (2, 4), I will have a direct path to the next closest apple at (2, 7), which I can reach by moving up three times from (2, 4).\n\nTherefore, my next move will be to continue moving towards the apple at (2, 4) by heading up. I will move UP to begin with.\n\nNext move: UP.\n\nFor the next turn, I should continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust my strategy accordingly. If the enemy snake moves towards my path, I may need to alter my course to avoid a collision. My priority after collecting the apple at (2, 4) will be to move up to collect the apple at (2, 7), and then I will reassess the board for the next target."

There's also an enemy snake at (2,2).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . .

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,3).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-8| + |4-3| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-3| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 6, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,2). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,2): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,1): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,2), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), which is closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nWait, from (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should just stick to collecting the closest apple first and reassess\u4e4b\u540e.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n4. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n5. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4):\n\n- Ensure (8,4) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,4). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,7).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,7):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to"

There's also an enemy snake at (3,4) with its body at (2,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1.

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (6,5). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,7) with its body at (4,7).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . A A 1 T . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . 2 . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (6,5), and the enemy snake is at (3,7) with its body at (4,7).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (6,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-6| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-6| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSo the closest apples are at (2,7) and (3,2), both with a distance of 6.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,7) with its body at (4,7). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first.\n\nFrom (6,5), to get to (2,7), I can:\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nThis path isn't safe because it goes through the enemy snake's body and head.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nAgain, this path leads me to the enemy snake's head.\n\nAnother option is to move down first to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- Move UP to (2,5)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,7)\n\nThis path seems longer but avoids the enemy snake. However, it's 8 steps, which is more than the initial 6 steps.\n\nLet me check the other closest apple at (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path is 6 steps and doesn't seem to intersect with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- Move UP to (0,3)\n\nThis path looks clear.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,7)\n\nThis path also seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat's a long way. I need to make sure I have a clear path or consider if it's worth going for it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the closer apples first and then go for the farther ones.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake is at (3,7) and its body is at (4,7), it might be moving in a certain direction.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement to avoid collision.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy snake's direction, it's hard to predict its next moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (3,2) first, as it seems more accessible without interfering with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (6,5) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nBut going to (9,1) from (2,7) is a long journey. Maybe I should consider eating another apple first if it's closer.\n\nWait, perhaps after (2,7), I can go to (9,1), but that's a long way. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Go to (3,2)\n\n2. Then to (0,3)\n\n3. Then to (1,7)\n\n4. Then to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, to (9,1)\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nNow, focusing on the first step: moving from (6,5) to (3,2).\n\nPath:\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, my snake is at position (5,5). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with its body at (3,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-6| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-6| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 2 steps away.

Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with body at (3,6). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . .

So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7).

So, moving left to (1,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThis is a long path, but if I can manage to eat all the apples without dying, I should be fine.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own body. So, I need to plan paths that don't cross over where I've already been.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movements. Although right now it's at (2,6) and (3,6), it can move around, so I need to keep an eye on its position as the game progresses.\n\nFor now, since it's not in my immediate path, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move RIGHT to (6,6), heading towards the apple at (6,7).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

If the enemy snake moves, (2,7) might be free, or it might not. I need to consider that.\n\nBut for now, assuming the enemy snake doesn't move in a way that blocks my path completely, I can plan to go to (1,7) and then adjust if necessary.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path.

But I can't predict its movement for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (1,7) again. If I go to (6,7), then left to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), and (2,7) is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,7) by going down to (1,7).

It's at a distance of |6-3| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps.\n\nThat's farther than going to (1,7), which is only 5 steps.

Maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). To get from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAlso 8 moves.\n\nComparing the two paths, going left to (3,7) and then down to (3,2) seems similar in length to going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (2,7), it might be safer to avoid the area around x=2.\n\nSo, maybe going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2) is a better option.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (0,3), then to (9,1).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. From (6,6), UP to (6,7) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, DOWN to (6,6), since I can't go left to (5,7) directly due to the enemy snake potentially blocking (2"

Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (5,6), but according to the board, I'm at (6,6). So, I'm at (6,6).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,4) with its body at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (6,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-6| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 1 step away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is not occupied by the enemy snake currently.\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says the enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (2,7) is not part of its body now. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nSo, if I move left from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), and (1,7), and (2,7) is not occupied, that should be fine.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake moves. If it moves down to (2,5), then (2,6) would be free, and (2,7) would still be free.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't occupy (2,7), I can proceed left to (1,7).\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nThat's 4 moves.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThat's 11 moves.\n\nIn total, that's 5 + 7 + 4 + 11 = 27 moves to collect all apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during these moves.\n\nLet me consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6).

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,2). There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated.

If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3.

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,4).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (2,4): |2-8| + |4-4| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-4| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-4| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-4| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 4, followed by (3,2) at distance 7, then (2,4) at 6, and (0,3) and (2,7) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,3). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,4), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,3): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,3), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), which is up and to the left, but that's the farthest.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should just stick to collecting the closest apple first and reassess\u4e4b\u540e.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but given the distance, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in while growing longer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,3). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,3), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block.

I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,6), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,5): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,4): empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (1,7), but that's quite a distance away: |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(3,2) is |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nWait, actually, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the path to (3,2) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move UP to (8,3)\n\n- Move UP to (8,4)\n\n- Move UP to (8,5)\n\n- Move UP to (8,6)\n\n- Move UP to (8,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat seems too long and convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves: 1 left, 1 up, 5 lefts.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is clear.\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n1.

But that's even longer.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's easier to reach.\n\nLet's look at (1,7). It's also relatively close, with a distance of 6.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nAgain, the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, go up to (6,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nAgain, passing through (4,7), which is risky.\n\nThis isn't looking good.

However, it's 8 steps, which is more than the initial 6 steps.\n\nLet me check the other closest apple at (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path is 6 steps and doesn't seem to intersect with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- Move UP to (0,3)\n\nThis path looks clear.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,7)\n\nThis path also seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat's a long way. I need to make sure I have a clear path or consider if it's worth going for it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the closer apples first and then go for the farther ones.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake is at (3,7) and its body is at (4,7), it might be moving in a certain direction.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement to avoid collision.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy snake's direction, it's hard to predict its next moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (3,2) first, as it seems more accessible without interfering with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (6,5) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nBut going to (9,1) from (2,7) is a long journey. Maybe I should consider eating another apple first if it's closer.\n\nWait, perhaps after (2,7), I can go to (9,1), but that's a long way. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Go to (3,2)\n\n2. Then to (0,3)\n\n3. Then to (1,7)\n\n4. Then to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, to (9,1)\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nNow, focusing on the first step: moving from (6,5) to (3,2).\n\nPath:\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, my snake is at position (5,5). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (5,5) to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n2. Then from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n3. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n4. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (1,7) to (9,1):\n\nThis is a long way. I"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,5) with its body at (2,6) and (2,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (6,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-6| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 1 step away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,5) with body at (2,6) and (2,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is part of the enemy snake's body. Wait, the enemy snake is at (2,5) with body at (2,6) and (2,7). So, (2,7) is occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nHmm, that could be a problem. If the enemy snake moves, (2,7) might be free, or it might not. I need to consider that.\n\nBut for now, assuming the enemy snake doesn't move in a way that blocks my path completely, I can plan to go to (1,7) and then adjust if necessary.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7) - but (2,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I need to consider if it will move.\n\nIf the enemy snake moves down from (2,7) to (2,6), then (2,7) would be free. But I can't predict its movement for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (1,7) again. If I go to (6,7), then left to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), and (2,7) is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,7) by going down to (1,7). Wait, no, I'm at (6,7), and (1,7) is to the left. But (2,7) is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go down to (6,6), then left to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), and then up to (1,7). But that's a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (2,6)\n\n- LEFT to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nThat's 7 moves instead of 5. It's longer, but it avoids the potential block at (2,7).\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake will move in a way that blocks my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). It's at a distance of |6-3| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps.\n\nThat's farther than going to (1,7), which is only 5 steps. So, maybe it's better to go for (1,7) first, despite the potential block.\n\nWait, but if I go for (1,7), and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (2,6), moving left to (2,7) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go up from (6,7) to (6,8), then left to (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), and then down to (1,7).\n\nThat's another way to reach (1,7) without passing through (2,7).\n\nBut that's even longer, at 8 moves.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). To get from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAlso 8 moves.\n\nComparing the two paths, going left to (3,7) and then down to (3,2) seems similar in length to going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (2,7), it might be safer to avoid the area around x=2.\n\nSo, maybe going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2) is a better option.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (0,3), then to (9,1).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. From (6,6), UP to (6,7) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, DOWN to (6,6), since I can't go left to (5,7) directly due to the enemy snake potentially blocking (2"

Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (5,6), but according to the board, I'm at (7,6). So, I'm at (7,6).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,2) with its body at (2,3), (2,4).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (7,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-7| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-6| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- (1,7): |1-7| + |7-6| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (6,7): |6-7| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 2 steps away (right, up).

By that time, the enemy snake could have moved down to (3,1), (3,0), or right to (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n\nSo, if it moves down, it's moving away from me, which is good.\n\nIf it moves right to (4,2), its body would be at (3,2), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nIn either case, as long as it doesn't block my path to (1,7), I should be fine.\n\nFrom (1,7) to (0,7) to (0,6), etc., the enemy snake should not be in those positions.\n\nAfter that, moving to (0,3), and then to (9,1), should be safe.\n\nWait, but moving from (0,3) to (9,1) is a long way.

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,6). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,4) with its body at (2,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . T 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (8,6), and the enemy snake is at (3,4).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,6).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-6| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-6| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 6, followed by (1,7) at 8, then (2,7) at 7, then (3,2) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 11.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (3,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,6), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,5): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,4): empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (1,7), but that's quite a distance away: |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(3,2) is |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nWait, actually, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the path to (3,2) from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move UP to (8,3)\n\n- Move UP to (8,4)\n\n- Move UP to (8,5)\n\n- Move UP to (8,6)\n\n- Move UP to (8,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat seems too long and convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1):\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,1)\n\n- Move UP to (8,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (6,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves: 1 left, 1 up, 5 lefts.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is clear.\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n1. LEFT to (8,1): empty\n\n2. UP to (8,2): empty\n\n3. LEFT to (7,2): empty\n\n4. LEFT to (6,2): empty\n\n5. LEFT to (5,2): empty\n\n6. LEFT to (4,2): empty\n\n7. LEFT to (3,2): that's the apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow again, so I need to ensure I have space.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (2,7), which is |2-3| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move UP to (3,3)\n\n- Move UP to (3,4)\n\n- Move UP to (3,5)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2"

My initial plan was to move UP to collect the apples at (2, 4) and (2, 7), but since I have moved RIGHT, I need to reassess the situation.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3, 2), which I previously planned to collect after the apple at (2, 7). However, since I am now at (4, 4), it makes sense to collect this apple first. To do so, I should move LEFT once and then move DOWN twice.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 2), I will need to decide my next move. The enemy snake (Snake #2) is at (7, 6), which is far from my current position, so I do not need to adjust my path to avoid it immediately.\n\nThe next closest apple is at (2, 7), which I can reach by moving LEFT twice from (3, 2) and then moving UP five times. After collecting the apple at (2, 7), I will move RIGHT once to align with the apple at (3, 2), and then move DOWN two times to collect it again (since I will have grown in length after collecting the previous apple).\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 2) for the second time, I will move RIGHT five times and then move UP once to collect the apple at (9, 1). This will maximize my score while keeping me at a safe distance from Snake #2.\n\nTo summarize, my next moves will be:\n- Move LEFT once to position myself to move down to the apple at (3, 2).\n- Move DOWN twice to collect the apple at (3, 2).\n- Move LEFT twice and then move UP five times to collect the apple at (2, 7).\n- Move RIGHT once to position myself for the next apple.\n- Move DOWN two times to collect the apple at (3, 2) again.\n- Move RIGHT five times and then move UP once to reach (9, 1).\n\nNext move: LEFT to position myself for the downward move to the apple at (3, 2).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (3, 2), move LEFT twice and then move UP five times to collect the apple at (2, 7). Then, move RIGHT once, followed by moving DOWN two times to get to (3, 2) again, and finally move RIGHT five times and then move UP once to reach (9, 1). Keep assessing the board for any changes in the enemy snake's position and adjust the strategy accordingly to avoid collisions."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to navigate through a 10x10 grid to collect apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (6,5). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,7) with its body at (4,7).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . A A 1 T . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . 2 . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (6,5), and the enemy snake is at (3,7) with its body at (4,7).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (6,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-6| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-6| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSo the closest apples are at (2,7) and (3,2), both with a distance of 6.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,7) with its body at (4,7). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first.\n\nFrom (6,5), to get to (2,7), I can:\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nThis path isn't safe because it goes through the enemy snake's body and head.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,7)\n\nAgain, this path leads me to the enemy snake's head.\n\nAnother option is to move down first to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- Move UP to (2,5)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,7)\n\nThis path seems longer but avoids the enemy snake. However, it's 8 steps, which is more than the initial 6 steps.\n\nLet me check the other closest apple at (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path is 6 steps and doesn't seem to intersect with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- Move UP to (0,3)\n\nThis path looks clear.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- Move UP to (1,4)\n\n- Move UP to (1,5)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,7)\n\nThis path also seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat's a long way. I need to make sure I have a clear path or consider if it's worth going for it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the closer apples first and then go for the farther ones.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake is at (3,7) and its body is at (4,7), it might be moving in a certain direction.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement to avoid collision.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy snake's direction, it's hard to predict its next moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (3,2) first, as it seems more accessible without interfering with the enemy snake's current position.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (6,5) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nBut going to (9,1) from (2,7) is a long journey. Maybe I should consider eating another apple first if it's closer.\n\nWait, perhaps after (2,7), I can go to (9,1), but that's a long way. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Go to (3,2)\n\n2. Then to (0,3)\n\n3. Then to (1,7)\n\n4. Then to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, to (9,1)\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nNow, focusing on the first step: moving from (6,5) to (3,2).\n\nPath:\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (5,5) to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n2.

Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (5,6), but according to the board, I'm at (6,6). Let me clarify that. In the board provided, position (6,6) is marked with a '2', which is me. So, I'm at (6,6).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,5) with its body at (2,6) and (2,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (6,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-6| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 1 step away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,5) with body at (2,6) and (2,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is part of the enemy snake's body. Wait, the enemy snake is at (2,5) with body at (2,6) and (2,7). So, (2,7) is occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nHmm, that could be a problem. If the enemy snake moves, (2,7) might be free, or it might not. I need to consider that.\n\nBut for now, assuming the enemy snake doesn't move in a way that blocks my path completely, I can plan to go to (1,7) and then adjust if necessary.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7) - but (2,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I need to consider if it will move.\n\nIf the enemy snake moves down from (2,7) to (2,6), then (2,7) would be free. But I can't predict its movement for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (1,7) again. If I go to (6,7), then left to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), and (2,7) is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,7) by going down to (1,7). Wait, no, I'm at (6,7), and (1,7) is to the left. But (2,7) is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go down to (6,6), then left to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), and then up to (1,7). But that's a longer path and might not be efficient.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (2,6)\n\n- LEFT to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nThat's 7 moves instead of 5. It's longer, but it avoids the potential block at (2,7).\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake will move in a way that blocks my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). It's at a distance of |6-3| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps.\n\nThat's farther than going to (1,7), which is only 5 steps. So, maybe it's better to go for (1,7) first, despite the potential block.\n\nWait, but if I go for (1,7), and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (2,6), moving left to (2,7) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go up from (6,7) to (6,8), then left to (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), and then down to (1,7).\n\nThat's another way to reach (1,7) without passing through (2,7).\n\nBut that's even longer, at 8 moves.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple first.\n\nLet me look at the apple at (3,2). To get from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,7):\n\n- DOWN to (6,6)\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAlso 8 moves.\n\nComparing the two paths, going left to (3,7) and then down to (3,2) seems similar in length to going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (2,6) and (2,7), it might be safer to avoid the area around x=2.\n\nSo, maybe going down to (6,6), left to (3,6), and then down to (3,2) is a better option.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (0,3), then to (9,1).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. From (6,6), UP to (6,7) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, DOWN to (6,6), since I can't go left to (5,7) directly due to the enemy snake potentially blocking (2"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,4) with its body at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (6,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-6| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 1 step away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is not occupied by the enemy snake currently.\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says the enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (2,7) is not part of its body now. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nSo, if I move left from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), and (1,7), and (2,7) is not occupied, that should be fine.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake moves. If it moves down to (2,5), then (2,6) would be free, and (2,7) would still be free.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't occupy (2,7), I can proceed left to (1,7).\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nThat's 4 moves.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThat's 11 moves.\n\nIn total, that's 5 + 7 + 4 + 11 = 27 moves to collect all apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during these moves.\n\nLet me consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, it's vertical, with head at (2,4), and body going up to (2,6).\n\nI need to predict where it might move.\n\nIf it moves up, it would go to (2,3), then (2,2), and so on.\n\nIf it moves down, it would go to (2,5), which is already occupied by its body, so it can't.\n\nWait, no, snakes can move in any direction, as long as they don't collide with themselves or walls.\n\nBut in this case, its body is at (2,5) and (2,6), so if it moves down from (2,4) to (2,5), it would be illegal because (2,5) is already occupied by its own body.\n\nSo, it can only move left or right from (2,4).\n\nIf it moves left to (1,4), then its body would follow to (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIf it moves right to (3,4), then its body would follow to (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nI need to consider these possible movements and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Enemy snake moves left to (1,4), body at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\n2. Enemy snake moves right to (3,4), body at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn the first scenario, if the enemy snake moves left to (1,4), its body would be at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIn the second scenario, if it moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn either case, positions (1,5), (1,6), (3,5), and (3,6) would be occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking back at my planned path:\n\nFrom (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7)\n\nThis path avoids the enemy snake's possible positions.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2)\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6), which are on my path.\n\nSo, I need to adjust my path to avoid these positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a different route to (3,2) that doesn't go through (3,6"

By that time, the enemy snake could have moved down to (3,1), (3,0), or right to (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n\nSo, if it moves down, it's moving away from me, which is good.\n\nIf it moves right to (4,2), its body would be at (3,2), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nIn either case, as long as it doesn't block my path to (1,7), I should be fine.\n\nFrom (1,7) to (0,7) to (0,6), etc., the enemy snake should not be in those positions.\n\nAfter that, moving to (0,3), and then to (9,1), should be safe.\n\nWait, but moving from (0,3) to (9,1) is a long way. Maybe I should consider going for (9,1) after (1,7).\n\nLet me see the distances:\n\nFrom (1,7) to (9,1): |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nFrom (1,7) to (0,3): |0-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nSo, (0,3) is closer. Maybe I should go for (0,3) first, then (9,1).\n\nBut, after eating (0,3), I would need to move to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThat still seems long, but I don't have much choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a shorter path by going to another apple.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (9,1), (0,3), (1,7), (6,7), and (5,7).\n\nI've already planned to go to (6,7), (5,7), (1,7), (0,3), then (9,1).\n\nAlternatively, after ("

Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (5,6), but according to the board, I'm at (8,5). So, I'm at (8,5).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (0,3), (1,7), (6,7), and (5,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,3) with body at (3,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (8,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-8| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n- (6,7): |6-8| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (5,7): |5-8| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 4 steps away (right, up, up, left). That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (8,5), moving right to (8,6), then up to (8,7), then up to (7,7), then left to (6,7).\n\nLooking at the board, position (8,6) is empty, (8,7) is empty, (7,7) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (3,3) with body at (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (5,7), which is |5-6| + |7-7| = 1 step away.\n\nSo, from (6,7), I can move left to (5,7).\n\nThen, looking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left\n\n- (9,1): |9-5| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10 steps\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-7| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps\n\nSo, after (5,7), I can go to (1,7), then consider moving to (9,1) or (0,3).\n\nBut (1,7) is closer, so maybe go to (1,7) next.\n\nFrom (5,7), move left to (4,7), then (3,7), (2,7), (1,7).\n\nNeed to ensure that these positions are clear.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, it's at (3,3) with body at (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). It doesn't seem to be near (1,7), so that should be safe.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nThat's a bit far. Maybe I should consider (0,3) which is |0-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nSo, from (1,7), I can move left to (0,7), then down to (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3).\n\nBut wait, (0,7) is the edge, so I need to make sure not to go beyond the board.\n\nWait, coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9), so (0,7) is valid.\n\nThen, from (0,3), I can move right to (1,3), (2,3), ..., up to (9,3), then down to (9,2), (9,1).\n\nBut that seems a bit long. Maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could move down to (1,6), (1,5), ..., (1,1), then right to (2,1), etc., up to (9,1).\n\nBut that might be longer.\n\nLet me consider the path:\n\n1. Current position: (8,5)\n\n2. Move right to (8,6)\n\n3. Move up to (8,7)\n\n4. Move up to (7,7)\n\n5. Move left to (6,7) - eat apple\n\n6. Move left to (5,7) - eat apple\n\n7.

So, it's horizontal, head at (3,3), body at (3,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nIf it moves right, it would go to (4,3), then (5,3), etc.\n\nIf it moves left, to (2,3), but its body is already there, so it can't continue left.\n\nIf it moves up, to (3,4), then (3,5), etc.\n\nIf it moves down, to (3,2), but its body is already there, so it can't continue down.\n\nSo, probably it will move right or up.\n\nI need to plan my path considering where the enemy snake might be.\n\nFrom my path above:\n\nAfter step 10, I'm at (1,7). By that time, the enemy snake could have moved right to (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nSo, as long as I avoid the area around (3,3) and beyond, I should be safe.\n\nFrom (1,7) to (0,7) to (0,6), etc., the enemy snake should not be in those positions.\n\nAfter that, moving to (0,3), and then to (9,1), should be safe.\n\nWait, but moving from (0,3) to (9,1) is a long way.

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,2), and enemy snake #1 is at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nMy head is at (7,3), and the enemy snake is at (2,1).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,3).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-3| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-3| = 7 + 0 = 7\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 4, followed by (3,2) at distance 5, then (2,4) at 6, (0,3) at 7, and (2,7) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,3), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nBut wait, going down from (7,3) to (7,1): that's moving down two steps.\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so (7,1) is actually down from (7,3).\n\nBut looking at the board:\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (7,3), down to (7,2), then (7,1), then right to (8,1), then (9,1).\n\nI need to make sure that these positions are empty and safe.\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2): empty.\n\nFrom (7,2) to (7,1): empty.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (8,1): empty.\n\nFrom (8,1) to (9,1): empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,3), to (3,2): I need to move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nThat's a longer path compared to going to (9,1).\n\nWait, no. From (7,3) to (3,3) is left four steps, then down to (3,2).\n\nBut looking back, going to (9,1) is down two steps, then right two steps.\n\nWait, earlier I thought down two steps to (7,1), but looking at the board again:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1).\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nGoing to (3,2) would be left four steps to (3,3), then down to (3,2), which is five steps.\n\nSo, (9,1) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving to (9,1) first makes sense.\n\nLet me think about the path again.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (7,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (7,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (8,1)\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach move, I need to ensure that the space is empty and safe.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't hit my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, then my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nThe next closest would be (3,2), but that's quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,4), which might be easier to reach next.\n\nLet me calculate the distance from (9,1) to (2,4):\n\n|2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThat's pretty far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7) is even farther.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the next closest at |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStill quite a distance.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,4) next, but that seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cluster of apples to efficiently collect them.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are spread out:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a cluster; they're fairly\u5206\u6563.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,1), then see which apple is closest from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,1). If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,4) with its body at (2,3).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 5, followed by (3,2) and (2,7) at 8, then (1,7) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,5), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,4): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(1,7) is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1.

But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block.

Move LEFT to position (3, 7).\n2. Move DOWN to position (3, 6), collecting the apple at (3, 2) on the way.\n3. Move RIGHT to position (3, 7), ensuring not to collide with Snake #2, which is currently at (6, 6).\n4. Move UP five times to collect the apple at (2, 7).\n5. Move RIGHT to position (3, 7).\n6. Move DOWN twice to collect the apple at (3, 2) again.\n7. Move RIGHT five times to position (8, 2).\n8. Move UP to position (8, 3), collecting the apple at (9, 1) on the way.\n\nIt's important to note that after collecting the apple at (2, 7), the snake will have grown in length, so the moves need to be carefully planned to avoid hitting the increased length of the snake's body. Also, the enemy snake's movements must be considered to avoid a collision.\n\nNext move: LEFT to position (3, 7), setting up to collect the apple at (3, 2).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving left, move DOWN to collect the apple at (3, 2), then move RIGHT once to avoid running into the enemy snake, and then continue moving UP to collect the apple at (2, 7). Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position and adjust the strategy to ensure safety while collecting apples.\n\nEnd your response with your decided next move: LEFT."

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (6,6). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (4,7) with its body at (4,6).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . A A . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . T . 2 . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (6,6), and the enemy snake is at (4,7) with its body at (4,6).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (6,6).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |2-6| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo the closest apples are at (2,7) with a distance of 5, followed by (1,7) at 6, then (3,2) at 7, (9,1) at 8, and (0,3) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (4,7) with its body at (4,6). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first since it's the closest.\n\nFrom (6,6), to get to (2,7), I need to go left to (2,6), then up to (2,7).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving up means increasing Y.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nSo, moving left to (4,6) is not possible because it's occupied.\n\nAlternatively, I can go up to (6,7), then left to (2,7), but that's farther.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\nBut moving to (4,7) is adjacent to the enemy snake's head, which might be dangerous if it moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe go up to (6,7), then up to (6,8), then left to (2,8), then down to (2,7). But that's even longer.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's easier to reach.\n\nLet's look at (1,7). It's also relatively close, with a distance of 6.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nAgain, the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, go up to (6,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nAgain, passing through (4,7), which is risky.\n\nThis isn't looking good. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet's look at (3,2), which is at a distance of 7.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path seems clear. Let's check:\n\n- (6,5): empty\n\n- (6,4): empty\n\n- (6,3): empty\n\n- (5,3): empty\n\n- (4,3): empty\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nGood, no obstacles here.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable, but it's far. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the order based on proximity after each move.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming. Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Move from (6,6) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nWait, that's a long path. Maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nAlternatively, after (2,7), maybe go directly to (9,1).\n\nFrom (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,7)\n\n- DOWN to (9,6)\n\n- DOWN to (9,5)\n\n- DOWN to (9,4)\n\n- DOWN to (9,3"

I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should prioritize apples that are closer to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is close to (0,3)\n\n- (1,7) is close to (2,7)\n\n- (9,1) is far from everything.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (5,5) to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n2. Then from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n3. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n4. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (1,7) to (9,1):\n\nThis is a long way. I"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with its body at (3,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-6| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-6| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 2 steps away.

Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with body at (3,6). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . .

So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7).

So, moving left to (1,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThis is a long path, but if I can manage to eat all the apples without dying, I should be fine.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own body. So, I need to plan paths that don't cross over where I've already been.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movements. Although right now it's at (2,6) and (3,6), it can move around, so I need to keep an eye on its position as the game progresses.\n\nFor now, since it's not in my immediate path, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move RIGHT to (6,6), heading towards the apple at (6,7).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,4) with its body at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (6,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-6| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 1 step away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is part of the enemy snake's body. Wait, the enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (2,7) is not occupied by the enemy snake currently.\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says the enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (2,7) is not part of its body now. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nSo, if I move left from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), and (1,7), and (2,7) is not occupied, that should be fine.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake moves. If it moves down to (2,5), then (2,6) would be free, and (2,7) would still be free.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't occupy (2,7), I can proceed left to (1,7).\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nThat's 4 moves.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThat's 11 moves.\n\nIn total, that's 5 + 7 + 4 + 11 = 27 moves to collect all apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during these moves.\n\nLet me consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, it's vertical, with head at (2,4), and body going up to (2,6).\n\nI need to predict where it might move.\n\nIf it moves up, it would go to (2,3), then (2,2), and so on.\n\nIf it moves down, it would go to (2,5), which is already occupied by its body, so it can't.\n\nWait, no, snakes can move in any direction, as long as they don't collide with themselves or walls.\n\nBut in this case, its body is at (2,5) and (2,6), so if it moves down from (2,4) to (2,5), it would be illegal because (2,5) is already occupied by its own body.\n\nSo, it can only move left or right from (2,4).\n\nIf it moves left to (1,4), then its body would follow to (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIf it moves right to (3,4), then its body would follow to (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nI need to consider these possible movements and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Enemy snake moves left to (1,4), body at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\n2. Enemy snake moves right to (3,4), body at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn the first scenario, if the enemy snake moves left to (1,4), its body would be at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIn the second scenario, if it moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn either case, positions (1,5), (1,6), (3,5), and (3,6) would be occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking back at my planned path:\n\nFrom (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7)\n\nThis path avoids the enemy snake's possible positions.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2)\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6), which"

So, it's vertical, with head at (2,2), and body going up to (2,4).\n\nI need to predict where it might move.\n\nIf it moves up, it would go to (2,3), then (2,4), but its body is already there, so it can't continue up.\n\nIf it moves down, it would go to (2,1), then (2,0).\n\nIf it moves left, to (1,2), then (1,3), etc.\n\nIf it moves right, to (3,2), then (3,3), etc.\n\nI need to consider these possible movements and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Enemy snake moves left to (1,2), body at (1,3) and (1,4).\n\n2. Enemy snake moves right to (3,2), body at (3,3) and (3,4).\n\nIn the first scenario, if the enemy snake moves left to (1,2), its body would be at (1,3) and (1,4).\n\nIn the second scenario, if it moves right to (3,2), its body would be at (3,3) and (3,4).\n\nIn either case, positions (1,3), (1,4), (3,3), and (3,4) would be occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking back at my planned path:\n\nFrom (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7)\n\nThis path avoids the enemy snake's possible positions.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2)\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves right to (3,2), its body would be at (3,3) and (3,4), which are on my path.\n\nSo, I need to adjust my path to avoid these positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a different route to (3,2) that doesn't go through (3,4) and (3,3).\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (1,7) to (3,2):\n\nOption 1:\n\n- DOWN to (1,6)\n\n- DOWN to (1,5)\n\n- DOWN to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nBut"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, my snake is at position (9,5). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (5,6), but according to the board, I'm at (9,5). So, I'm at (9,5).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (0,3), (1,7), (6,7), and (5,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,4) with body at (3,3), (3,2), (2,2).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (9,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-9| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-5| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (6,7): |6-9| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (5,7): |5-9| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,1), which is only 4 steps away (down, down, down, left). That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (9,5), moving down to (9,4), then down to (9,3), down to (9,2), left to (9,1).\n\nLooking at the board, position (9,4) is empty, (9,3) is empty, (9,2) is empty, and (9,1) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (3,4) with body at (3,3), (2,2), (2,3). So, (9,1) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,1). The next closest would be (5,7), which is |5-9| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (6,7) is |6-9| + |7-1| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps.\n\nSo, maybe go for (6,7) next.\n\nFrom (9,1), moving up to (9,2), up to (9,3), up to (9,4), up to (9,5), up to (9,6), up to (9,7), left to (8,7), left to (7,7), left to (6,7).\n\nBut that seems like a long path. Maybe there's a shorter way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (1,7) next, which is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nThat's even farther. So, (6,7) seems better.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (0,3) next, which is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nStill, (6,7) is closer.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1. Go to (9,1)\n\n2. Then to (6,7)\n\n3. Then to (5,7)\n\n4. Then to (1,7)\n\n5. Finally to (0,3)\n\nLet me think about potential conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,4), body at (3,3), (3,2), (2,2).\n\nDepending on its direction, it could move in different ways.\n\nIf it's moving right, it would go to (4,4), then (5,4), etc.\n\nIf it's moving down, it can't because (3,3) is occupied by its body.\n\nIf it's moving up, to (3,5), then (3,6), etc.\n\nIf it's moving left, to (2,4), then (1,4), etc.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't cross paths with where the enemy snake might be.\n\nFor now, since I'm going down to (9,1), which is far from the enemy snake's current position, I should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll need to move towards (6,7). Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (9,1), up to (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), left to (8,7), left to (7,7), left to (6,7).\n\nI need to ensure that by the time I reach (6,7), the enemy snake isn't there.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (3,4), and assuming it moves at the same speed as me, it would take them several moves to get to (6,7).\n\nBy the time I reach (6,7), they would probably still be somewhere around (3,4) to (4,4), depending on their direction.\n\nSo, it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (6,7), I can proceed to (5,7), which is just left by one step.\n\nThen, from (5,7), I can go left to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and then down to (1,6), (1,5), etc., to (1,1), then left to (0,1), up to (0,2), (0,3).\n\nBut that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could move down directly to (1,3), but that's not a straight path.\n\nWait, no. To move from (1,7) to (0,3), the shortest path would be left to (0,7), then down to (0,3).\n\nThat's only 4 steps: left, down, down, down.\n\nSo, that's efficient.\n\nThen, from (0,3), I can move right to (1,3), (2,3), ..., up to (9,3), then down to (9,2), (9,1).\n\nBut (9,1) is already eaten, so maybe just go to (9,2), or another apple.\n\nWait, I already planned to go to (9,1) first, then (6,7), (5,7), (1,7), (0,3).\n\nAfter (0,3), the only apple left is at (9,1), but I've already eaten that.\n\nWait, no, (9,1) is already eaten in the first step.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the sequence.\n\nLet me list the apples again:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (6,7)\n\n- (5,7)\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Go to (9,1)\n\n2. Go to (6,7)\n\n3. Go to (5,7)\n\n4. Go to (1,7)\n\n5. Go to (0,3)\n\nAfter eating (0,3), there are no more apples left.\n\nWait, but in the board, there are five apples, so I need to eat all of them in sequence.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't cross the enemy snake and that I don't run into myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I grow longer, I have to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nSo, after eating each apple, my body length increases by one.\n\nI need to plan paths that account for that.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps more carefully.\n\nCurrent position: (9,5)\n\nStep 1: Move down to (9,4)\n\nStep 2: Move down to (9,3)\n\nStep 3: Move down to (9,2)\n\nStep 4: Move down to (9,1) - eat apple\n\nNow, my body is longer, so I need to make sure that I don't step on my own tail.\n\nFrom (9,1), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nThe next closest apple is (6,7), which is |6-9| + |7-1| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (5,7) is |5-9| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10 steps.\n\n(1,7) is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9"

There are apples at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 . . . . .

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (7,2).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-7| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,4): |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-7| + |7-2| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-7| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 3, followed by (3,2) at distance 4, then (2,4) at 7, (0,3) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (7,2), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (7,1), then right to (9,1). But I need to check if that path is blocked.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,2), down to (7,1). Is (7,1) empty? It doesn't have an apple or another snake, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (7,1), right to (8,1), then to (9,1). Again, these seem empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,1). It's quite far away, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (3,2), which is closer than the others except (9,1). Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's closer and in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,2), to (3,2), I need to move left to (3,2). That's four steps to the left.\n\nBut between (7,2) and (3,2), there are no obstacles shown, so it should be clear.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (3,2), so eating it will make me grow.\n\nThen, after eating (3,2), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to Prioritize which one next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about eating the apple that's closest to my current position first, and then proceed to the next closest.\n\nThis is known as a greedy approach, where I always go for the nearest apple.\n\nIn this case, (9,1) is closest, followed by (3,2).\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), eat it, then proceed to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating one apple, the path to the next apple is still accessible.\n\nWait, another consideration: the enemy snake. If I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nIf I move down to row 1, column 9, the enemy is at column 3, row 1.\n\nSo, quite far away horizontally.\n\nUnless the enemy snake starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet.\n\nAssuming it stays put or moves away, moving to (9,1) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can then consider moving to (3,2).\n\nFrom (9,1), to (3,2), I need to move up to (9,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, after eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own body.\n\nGiven that I'm moving from (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1), and then up to (9,2), then left to (3,2), I need to make sure that in this path, I don't bump into my own body.\n\nBut in this scenario, since I'm moving straightforwardly, and the grid is large enough, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first, since it's in the same row as my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (3,2), eat it, then maybe move up or down to another apple.\n\nBut then, the apple at (9,1) would be further away.\n\nWait, perhaps a better strategy is to prioritize apples based on their positions and the enemy's position.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI can model this as a graph where each grid cell is a node, and edges connect adjacent cells, excluding walls and occupied cells.\n\nThen, I can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path to the nearest apple, considering the current board state.\n\nBut since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the following strategy:\n\n1. Identify all apples and their distances from my current position.\n\n2. Choose the nearest apple and move towards it, avoiding obstacles and other snakes.\n\n3. After eating the apple, update the board and repeat the process.\n\n4. Keep track of my growing body to avoid hitting myself.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I don't get trapped by the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should also consider the positions of the enemy snakes and plan paths that avoid them.\n\nIn this case, enemy snake #1 is at (3,1), and it's alone. Assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, first, go to (9,1), then to (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,1), the enemy snake is at (3,1). If it moves right towards me, it could potentially block my path or collide with me.\n\nHowever, snakes can only occupy one cell, and if I'm moving down to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then to (9,1), the enemy would have to move up to intercept me, which might not be its strategy.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that"

Maybe I can consider eating that one next.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's a multi-apple scenario, and I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (3,2) first since it's in the same row.\n\nFrom (7,3), to (3,2): I need to move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nThat's a longer path compared to going to (9,1).\n\nWait, no. From (7,3) to (3,3) is left four steps, then down to (3,2).\n\nBut looking back, going to (9,1) is down two steps, then right two steps.\n\nWait, earlier I thought down two steps to (7,1), but looking at the board again:\n\nFrom (7,3) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (8,1) to (9,1).\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nGoing to (3,2) would be left four steps to (3,3), then down to (3,2), which is five steps.\n\nSo, (9,1) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving to (9,1) first makes sense.\n\nLet me think about the path again.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n1. DOWN to (7,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (7,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (8,1)\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach move, I need to ensure that the space is empty and safe.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't hit my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, then my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nThe next closest would be (3,2), but that's quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,4), which might be easier to reach next.\n\nLet me calculate the distance from (9,1) to (2,4):\n\n|2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThat's pretty far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,7) is even farther.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the next closest at |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStill quite a distance.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,4) next, but that seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a cluster of apples to efficiently collect them.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are spread out:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a cluster; they're fairly\u5206\u6563.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,1), then see which apple is closest from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,1). If I move towards (9,1), the enemy might try to intercept me, but it's quite far away, so it's less likely.\n\nMoreover, in snake games, sometimes the enemy snake can be unpredictable, so I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my plan to go to (9,1) first.\n\nOnce I reach (9,1), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, I can recalculate the distances and choose the nearest one again.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me"

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity.

Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,4), which is closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer than (2,4) from (9,1).\n\nWait, from (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,4): |2-9| + |4-1| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,4) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,4), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently.

DOWN to (8,2)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,2). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,2), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,4):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,1) is occupied by an apple at (2,1), but wait, the apples are at (9,1), (2,4), (2,7), (3,2), and (0,3).

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (8,5).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-8| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (0,3): |0-8| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (1,7): |1-8| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nSo the closest apple is at (9,1) with a distance of 5, followed by (3,2) and (2,7) at 8, then (1,7) at 9, and finally (0,3) at 10.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (2,4). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (9,1) first since it's closest.\n\nFrom (8,5), to get to (9,1), I need to go down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving down means decreasing Y.\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n- DOWN to (8,4)\n\n- DOWN to (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2)\n\n- DOWN to (8,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nLet's check if these positions are empty:\n\n- (8,4): looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,3): empty.\n\n- (8,2): empty.\n\n- (8,1): empty.\n\n- (9,1): that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake doesn't interfere. Enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away. It would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I move, the enemy snake will also move. But since I don't know its direction, I'll assume it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSo, moving to (9,1) seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), eat the apple, and grow, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,1), the next closest apple is (3,2), but that's quite a distance away: |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (2,7) is |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\n(1,7) is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance. Maybe I should consider the apple at (2,7), but it's farther.\n\nWait, no, according to the earlier calculation, (3,2) is closer from (9,1).\n\nFrom (9,1):\n\n- (3,2): |3-9| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nSo, (3,2) is the closest next apple.\n\nBut looking at the board, it might be easier to go to (2,7) because it's in a different direction, but actually, it's farther.\n\nGiven that, I should stick with going to (3,2) next.\n\nHowever, that's still a long way. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to collect the apple at (2,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should try to collect apples in a particular order to minimize total movement.\n\nBut with apples so spread out, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,3), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after eating (9,1), I can head towards (2,7), but that's a longer distance.\n\nPerhaps I should consider leaving some escape routes.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving towards (9,1).\n\nFrom (8,5):\n\n1. DOWN to (8,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (8,3)\n\n3. DOWN to (8,2)\n\n4. DOWN to (8,1)\n\n5. RIGHT to (9,1)\n\nEach of these moves needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4):\n\n- Ensure (8,4) is empty, which it is.\n\n- Also, ensure that my tail doesn't extend into (8,4). But since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my tail won't be there.\n\nAfter moving to (8,4), I haven't eaten an apple yet, so my tail doesn't grow.\n\nNext, move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3):\n\n- Ensure (8,3) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,2):\n\n- Ensure (8,2) is empty, which it is.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (8,1):\n\n- Ensure (8,1) is empty, which it is.\n\nFinally, move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n- That's the apple, so I eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail grows by one block.\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move to (9,1), my tail will extend by one block. So, my tail will now include the previous position, (8,1).\n\nTherefore, when I move next, I need to avoid (8,1), which is now part of my tail.\n\nSo, from (9,1), if I want to move to (3,2), which is to the left and down, I need to plan a path that doesn't go through my own tail.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I might grow longer in between, making it harder to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a different apple that's closer or in a more convenient direction.\n\nLooking at the board again, perhaps I should consider the apple at (2,7).\n\nFrom (9,1), moving to (2,7):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to"

My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (6,6). There are apples at (9,1), (2,7), (3,2), (0,3), and (1,7). There's also an enemy snake at (4,7) with its body at (4,6).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . A A . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . T . 2 . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\nMy head is at (6,6), and the enemy snake is at (4,7) with its body at (4,6).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. But I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or get trapped.\n\nLet me list the apples in order of proximity. My current position is (6,6).\n\nCalculate distances to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- (9,1): |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |2-6| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo the closest apples are at (2,7) with a distance of 5, followed by (1,7) at 6, then (3,2) at 7, (9,1) at 8, and (0,3) at 9.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake is at (4,7) with its body at (4,6). I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to each apple and make sure it's safe.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,7) first since it's the closest.\n\nFrom (6,6), to get to (2,7), I need to go left to (2,6), then up to (2,7).\n\nWait, coordinates: Y increases upwards, so moving up means increasing Y.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nSo, moving left to (4,6) is not possible because it's occupied.\n\nAlternatively, I can go up to (6,7), then left to (2,7), but that's farther.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\nBut moving to (4,7) is adjacent to the enemy snake's head, which might be dangerous if it moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe go up to (6,7), then up to (6,8), then left to (2,8), then down to (2,7). But that's even longer.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's easier to reach.\n\nLet's look at (1,7). It's also relatively close, with a distance of 6.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- LEFT to (5,6)\n\n- LEFT to (4,6) [occupied by enemy snake's body]\n\nAgain, the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, go up to (6,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7) [enemy snake's head]\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nAgain, passing through (4,7), which is risky.\n\nThis isn't looking good. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet's look at (3,2), which is at a distance of 7.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThis path seems clear. Let's check:\n\n- (6,5): empty\n\n- (6,4): empty\n\n- (6,3): empty\n\n- (5,3): empty\n\n- (4,3): empty\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nGood, no obstacles here.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), my tail will grow, so I need to ensure I have space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple would be (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter that, the next closest is (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, (2,7) is |2-1| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1 step.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\nSimple.\n\nFinally, (9,1) is |9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable, but it's far. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the order based on proximity after each move.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming. Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Move from (6,6) to (3,2):\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4)\n\n- DOWN to (6,3)\n\n- LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n2. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n3. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n4. Then from (1,7) to (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (2,7) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- ...\n\nWait, that's a long path. Maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nAlternatively, after (2,7), maybe go directly to (9,1).\n\nFrom (2,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,7)\n\n- DOWN to (9,6)\n\n- DOWN to (9,5)\n\n- DOWN to (9,4)\n\n- DOWN to (9,3"

I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake on the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think differently.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (3,2), (0,3), (1,7), and (6,7). There's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with its body at (3,7).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 3 steps away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,5) is empty, (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,7) with body at (3,7). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . A 1 T T . A . . .\n\nSo, position (6,7) has an apple, and the enemy snake is at (2,7) and (3,7). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps away.\n\nWait, (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake's body and head. So, moving left from (6,7) to (5,7) is fine, but then (4,7) is empty, (3,7) has the enemy snake's body, (2,7) has its head, and (1,7) has an apple.\n\nSo, if I move from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), but then (3,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. So, I can't continue left beyond (4,7) without hitting the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, going for (1,7) isn't feasible from (6,7) because of the enemy snake in the way.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (6,7), I should go for (3,2), which is 8 steps away, or (0,3), which is |0-6| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps away.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (9,1), which is |9-6| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps away.\n\nBut that seems a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sequence of apples based on their positions and the enemy snake's position.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will be longer, so I need to ensure I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a small body right now, just the head at (5,5), and after eating (6,7), my tail will be at (5,5), and my head at (6,7).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,7), my tail moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving from (5,5) to (6,7), which is up and right, and then planning to go left to (5,7), etc., as long as I don't make sharp turns that would cause my head to bump into my tail, I should be fine.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe I should just focus on getting to (6,7) first, since it's the closest apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can aim for (3,2), which is relatively central and not too far from (6,7).\n\nFrom (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- Move LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- Move DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- Move DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 8 steps, which seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, maybe go for (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThen, go for (1,7), which is |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\nAgain, straightforward.\n\nFinally, go for (9,1), which is |9-1| + |1-7| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps away.\n\nThat seems like a long journey, but by that time, I should have grown quite a bit, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (2,7) after (6,7), since it's closer than (3,2).\n\nWait, (2,7) is |2-6| + |7-7| = 4 steps to the left.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that positions (3,7) and (2,7) are occupied by the enemy snake, so moving left from (6,7) to (2,7) would involve passing through (3,7) and (2,7), which are occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nSo, that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,2) seems like the better option after (6,7).\n\nAlright, so my plan is:\n\n1. Move from (5,5) to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\n2. Then from (6,7) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,6)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\n3. Then from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n4. Then from (0,3) to (1,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- UP to (1,5)\n\n- UP to (1,6)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n5. Finally, from (1,7) to (9,1):\n\nThis is a long way. I"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with its body at (3,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (5,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-5| + |1-6| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-5| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (0,3): |0-5| + |3-6| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (1,7): |1-5| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,7): |6-5| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 2 steps away.

Let's see:\n\nFrom (5,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,6) is empty, and (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (6,7), but there's also an enemy snake at (2,6) with body at (3,6). Is (6,7) safe?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . .

So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7).

So, moving left to (1,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- RIGHT to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThis is a long path, but if I can manage to eat all the apples without dying, I should be fine.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own body. So, I need to plan paths that don't cross over where I've already been.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movements. Although right now it's at (2,6) and (3,6), it can move around, so I need to keep an eye on its position as the game progresses.\n\nFor now, since it's not in my immediate path, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move RIGHT to (6,6), heading towards the apple at (6,7).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,4) with its body at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (6,6):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (3,2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (1,7): |1-6| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,7): |6-6| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (6,7), which is only 1 step away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,6), to (6,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,7)\n\nLooking at the board, position (6,7) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (6,7) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (6,7). The next closest would be (1,7), which is |1-6| + |7-7| = 5 steps away horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,2), which is |3-6| + |2-7| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps away.\n\nWait, but (1,7) is directly left from (6,7). From (6,7), to (1,7), I would need to move LEFT five times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (6,7) to (1,7) is safe. Let's see:\n\n- (6,7) to (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nPosition (3,7) is empty, as per the board, and (2,7) is part of the enemy snake's body. Wait, the enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (2,7) is not occupied by the enemy snake currently.\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says the enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, (2,7) is not part of its body now. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nSo, if I move left from (6,7) to (5,7), then to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), and (1,7), and (2,7) is not occupied, that should be fine.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy snake moves. If it moves down to (2,5), then (2,6) would be free, and (2,7) would still be free.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't occupy (2,7), I can proceed left to (1,7).\n\nAfter reaching (1,7), the next apple is at (3,2), which is |3-1| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps away.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3), which is |0-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1), which is |9-0| + |1-3| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path. Let me try to plan it out in more detail.\n\nFirst, get to (6,7):\n\n- UP to (6,7)\n\nThen, from (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- LEFT to (5,7)\n\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (2,7)\n\n- LEFT to (1,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (2,7)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,6)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves.\n\nThen, from (3,2) to (0,3):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\nThat's 4 moves.\n\nFinally, from (0,3) to (9,1):\n\n- RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n- DOWN to (9,2)\n\n- DOWN to (9,1)\n\nThat's 11 moves.\n\nIn total, that's 5 + 7 + 4 + 11 = 27 moves to collect all apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during these moves.\n\nLet me consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). So, it's vertical, with head at (2,4), and body going up to (2,6).\n\nI need to predict where it might move.\n\nIf it moves up, it would go to (2,3), then (2,2), and so on.\n\nIf it moves down, it would go to (2,5), which is already occupied by its body, so it can't.\n\nWait, no, snakes can move in any direction, as long as they don't collide with themselves or walls.\n\nBut in this case, its body is at (2,5) and (2,6), so if it moves down from (2,4) to (2,5), it would be illegal because (2,5) is already occupied by its own body.\n\nSo, it can only move left or right from (2,4).\n\nIf it moves left to (1,4), then its body would follow to (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIf it moves right to (3,4), then its body would follow to (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nI need to consider these possible movements and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Enemy snake moves left to (1,4), body at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\n2. Enemy snake moves right to (3,4), body at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn the first scenario, if the enemy snake moves left to (1,4), its body would be at (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIn the second scenario, if it moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn either case, positions (1,5), (1,6), (3,5), and (3,6) would be occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking back at my planned path:\n\nFrom (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7)\n\nThis path avoids the enemy snake's possible positions.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2)\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves right to (3,4), its body would be at (3,5) and (3,6), which"

So, it's vertical, with head at (2,2), and body going up to (2,4).\n\nI need to predict where it might move.\n\nIf it moves up, it would go to (2,3), then (2,4), but its body is already there, so it can't continue up.\n\nIf it moves down, it would go to (2,1), then (2,0).\n\nIf it moves left, to (1,2), then (1,3), etc.\n\nIf it moves right, to (3,2), then (3,3), etc.\n\nI need to consider these possible movements and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Enemy snake moves left to (1,2), body at (1,3) and (1,4).\n\n2. Enemy snake moves right to (3,2), body at (3,3) and (3,4).\n\nIn the first scenario, if the enemy snake moves left to (1,2), its body would be at (1,3) and (1,4).\n\nIn the second scenario, if it moves right to (3,2), its body would be at (3,3) and (3,4).\n\nIn either case, positions (1,3), (1,4), (3,3), and (3,4) would be occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking back at my planned path:\n\nFrom (6,7) to (1,7):\n\n- (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7)\n\nThis path avoids the enemy snake's possible positions.\n\nThen, from (1,7) to (3,2):\n\n- (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2)\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves right to (3,2), its body would be at (3,3) and (3,4), which are on my path.\n\nSo, I need to adjust my path to avoid these positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a different route to (3,2) that doesn't go through (3,4) and (3,3).\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (1,7) to (3,2):\n\nOption 1:\n\n- DOWN to (1,6)\n\n- DOWN to (1,5)\n\n- DOWN to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nBut"

Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (5,6), but according to the board, I'm at (9,5). So, I'm at (9,5).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. There are apples at (9,1), (0,3), (1,7), (6,7), and (5,7). There's also an enemy snake at (3,4) with body at (3,3), (3,2), (2,2).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or the walls.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (9,5):\n\n- (9,1): Manhattan distance is |9-9| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- (0,3): |0-9| + |3-5| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\n- (1,7): |1-9| + |7-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- (6,7): |6-9| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (5,7): |5-9| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,1), which is only 4 steps away (down, down, down, left). That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Let's see:\n\nFrom (9,5), moving down to (9,4), then down to (9,3), down to (9,2), left to (9,1).\n\nLooking at the board, position (9,4) is empty, (9,3) is empty, (9,2) is empty, and (9,1) has an apple. Great, no enemy snakes in the way.\n\nWait, but there's an enemy snake at (3,4) with body at (3,3), (2,2), (2,3). So, (9,1) is away from the enemy snake, so it should be safe to go there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path and won't bump into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,1). The next closest would be (5,7), which is |5-9| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (6,7) is |6-9| + |7-1| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps.\n\nSo, maybe go for (6,7) next.\n\nFrom (9,1), moving up to (9,2), up to (9,3), up to (9,4), up to (9,5), up to (9,6), up to (9,7), left to (8,7), left to (7,7), left to (6,7).\n\nBut that seems like a long path. Maybe there's a shorter way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (1,7) next, which is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\nThat's even farther. So, (6,7) seems better.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for (0,3) next, which is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9 + 2 = 11 steps.\n\nStill, (6,7) is closer.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1. Go to (9,1)\n\n2. Then to (6,7)\n\n3. Then to (5,7)\n\n4. Then to (1,7)\n\n5.

Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (9,1), up to (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), left to (8,7), left to (7,7), left to (6,7).\n\nI need to ensure that by the time I reach (6,7), the enemy snake isn't there.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (3,4), and assuming it moves at the same speed as me, it would take them several moves to get to (6,7).\n\nBy the time I reach (6,7), they would probably still be somewhere around (3,4) to (4,4), depending on their direction.\n\nSo, it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (6,7), I can proceed to (5,7), which is just left by one step.\n\nThen, from (5,7), I can go left to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and then down to (1,6), (1,5), etc., to (1,1), then left to (0,1), up to (0,2), (0,3).\n\nBut that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could move down directly to (1,3), but that's not a straight path.\n\nWait, no. To move from (1,7) to (0,3), the shortest path would be left to (0,7), then down to (0,3).\n\nThat's only 4 steps: left, down, down, down.\n\nSo, that's efficient.\n\nThen, from (0,3), I can move right to (1,3), (2,3), ..., up to (9,3), then down to (9,2), (9,1).\n\nBut (9,1) is already eaten, so maybe just go to (9,2), or another apple.\n\nWait, I already planned to go to (9,1) first, then (6,7), (5,7), (1,7), (0,3).\n\nAfter (0,3), the only apple left is at (9,1), but I've already eaten that.\n\nWait, no, (9,1) is already eaten in the first step.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the sequence.\n\nLet me list the apples again:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (6,7)\n\n- (5,7)\n\nPlan:\n\n1.

Go to (0,3)\n\nAfter eating (0,3), there are no more apples left.\n\nWait, but in the board, there are five apples, so I need to eat all of them in sequence.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't cross the enemy snake and that I don't run into myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I grow longer, I have to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nSo, after eating each apple, my body length increases by one.\n\nI need to plan paths that account for that.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps more carefully.\n\nCurrent position: (9,5)\n\nStep 1: Move down to (9,4)\n\nStep 2: Move down to (9,3)\n\nStep 3: Move down to (9,2)\n\nStep 4: Move down to (9,1) - eat apple\n\nNow, my body is longer, so I need to make sure that I don't step on my own tail.\n\nFrom (9,1), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nThe next closest apple is (6,7), which is |6-9| + |7-1| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (5,7) is |5-9| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10 steps.\n\n(1,7) is |1-9| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\n(0,3) is |0-9| + |3-1| = 9"
