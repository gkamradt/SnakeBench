This is a favorable move since it's very close.\n   - Additionally, there is an apple at (5, 4) which is directly to my right, making it an equally attractive target.\n\n2. **Risk Evaluation:**\n   - I don't see any immediate threats from Snake #2, as it is positioned at (0, 8) with no body segments. Therefore, it poses no immediate risk to my movement options at this moment.\n   - There is no wall or obstacle close to my current position, and my next move should avoid running into myself since my position is currently just one block (4, 4).\n\n3. **Deciding Move:**\n   - Moving **RIGHT** from (4, 4) will take me to (5, 4) where one apple is located. This will allow me to grow and collect a point without any risks.\n   - After acquiring the apple at (5, 4), I can decide on the subsequent move which could be **UP** to grab the apple at (5, 5) next, depending on the situation.\n\n4. **Strategy for Next Turn:**\n   - After moving right to collect the apple at (5, 4), I should reassess the positions of other apples and the enemy snake to determine my next target - likely the apple at (5, 5) through an **UP** move from (5, 4).\n\nTaking all these points into consideration, my next move is to go **RIGHT** to collect the apple at (5, 4).\n\n**Decided Move: RIGHT**"

With a nearby snake at (4,4) but without any body, they do not pose immediate danger unless they move into a direct path collision course in the future turns.\n\nConsidering the board and other elements:\n- The apple at (5,5) is closer to the enemy than to my snake.

Given that the map tops out at (0, 9), any additional upward movement will result in hitting the boundary, which will cause the game to end. Therefore, UP is an invalid move.\n\nDirections:\n- UP is no longer an option as it leads outside the board.\n- DOWN will place the snake back toward a more central location at (0, 8), allowing for position adjustments later on.\n- LEFT and RIGHT transitions are also critical: Moving LEFT from (0, 9) would be out of bounds.\n- RIGHT would move the snake to (1, 9), which is a safe move but limits next-move options to mostly DOWN or further RIGHT.\n\nStrategy Considerations:\n- The nearest apple strategically obtainable is at (3, 8). Going RIGHT initially allows subsequent moves to traverse downwards and towards the center where this apple is located.\n- To avoid enemy snake #1, currently perceived at (5, 4) with the body at (4, 4), and ensuring that no direct collisions occur. Directing the snake towards apples not in the line of motion of the enemy snake might be a worthwhile consideration.\n\nConsidering these options and strategic goals, the safest and most beneficial move acts on paving the path towards the apple at (3, 8) as well as avoiding putting the snake in an immediate trap:\n- Moving RIGHT to (1, 9) would keep the snake on the edge but allows for subsequent downward moves aligning more toward desired apple positions. Having the tail in (0, 9) itself may open up further possibilities such as looping back if required based on enemy movement patterns.\n\nFuture Strategy Reminders:\n- Watch the movements of enemy snake #1 and adjust the path to avoid direct conflicts.\n- Keep eyeing potential apple positions for growth and score advances.\n- Manage snake's length and path to maintain flexibility in movement while pursuing strategic objectives.\n\nNext decided move: RIGHT"
