It allows you to collect an immediate apple, enhancing your score and length without posing any immediate risks. Additionally, the pathway below is clear, ensuring a safe move away from enemy positions.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- After collecting the apple at (9, 3), prioritize moving downward again if safe, to continue collecting apples and staying near the bottom edge. Simultaneously, keep an eye on the positions of enemy snakes to avoid potential collisions.\n\n**Next Move:** **DOWN**"
