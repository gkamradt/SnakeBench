Additionally, going upwards doesn't present any immediate threats but doesn't capitalize on the nearby opportunities.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (7, 3):\n   - **Pros:** Directly moves me closer to the apple at (7, 2), allowing me to collect it in the next move.\n   - **Cons:** Continues towards the lower part of the board, but currently, there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\n3. **RIGHT** to (8, 4):\n   - **Pros:** Keeps the momentum going to the right.\n   - **Cons:** There's no immediate apple or benefit in this direction. Additionally, moving further right could limit future movement options as I approach the board's edge.\n\n4. **LEFT** to (6, 4):\n   - **Pros:** None.
