Our primary goal is to grow by eating apples while avoiding collisions with other snakes, walls, or our own body.\n\nSince snake #1 is at (8, 7) and its body is not provided, it's not currently a threat. However, we should keep an eye on its movements.\n\nTo minimize the risk of collisions and maximize our chances of eating apples, let's focus on moving towards the apples diagonally. This way, we can avoid moving directly into our own body or another snake.\n\nFor our first move, let's head towards the apple at (6, 3) by moving diagonally up and right.
