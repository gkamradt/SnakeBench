The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible to grow and gain points. Here are the coordinates of the apples: (1, 0), (3, 8), (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8).\n\n**Immediate Observations:**\n1. Apples on the Left: There are three apples stacked vertically at x=0, specifically at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8). Additionally, another apple is at (1, 0).\n2. Apple on the Top-Left: There's an apple at (3, 8), which is relatively distant from my current position.\n3. Enemy Snake: Snake #2 is at (9, 9), far away from me, so it's not an immediate threat.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n- **UP** (6, 3): This move doesn't bring me closer to an apple immediately, but it's the start toward reaching the upper apples like (3, 8). Also, it provides some maneuverability as I get closer to the apples on x=0.\n- **DOWN** (6, 1): Moving down doesn't bring any immediate benefit, and it actually takes me further away from all available apples.\n- **LEFT** (5, 2): This move heads toward the apple at (1, 0). It's a direct path to collect apples located horizontally left and subsequently the vertically stacked ones on x=0.\n- **RIGHT** (7, 2): It doesn't get me closer to any apple, and leads me toward the edge of the board, with no current apple in that direction. \n\n**Strategizing for Future Turns:**\nAim to gather the apples on the left first, since they cluster together, making it efficient to gather multiple in succession. Monitor the movements of other snakes in case their trajectories conflict with my path.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best next move is to start heading left, ultimately aiming for the collection of apples along the x=0 line. \n\nTherefore, my move this turn is: **LEFT**."

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible to grow and gain points. Here are the coordinates of the apples: (1, 0), (3, 8), (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8).\n\n**Immediate Observations:**\n1. Apples on the Left: There are three apples stacked vertically at x=0, specifically at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8). Additionally, another apple is at (1, 0).\n2. Apple on the Top-Left: There's an apple at (3, 8), which is relatively distant from my current position.\n3. Enemy Snake: Snake #2 is at (9, 9), far away from me, so it's not an immediate threat.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n- **UP** (6, 3): This move doesn't bring me closer to an apple immediately, but it's the start toward reaching the upper apples like (3, 8). Also, it provides some maneuverability as I get closer to the apples on x=0.\n- **DOWN** (6, 1): Moving down doesn't bring any immediate benefit, and it actually takes me further away from all available apples.\n- **LEFT** (5, 2): This move heads toward the apple at (1, 0). It's a direct path to collect apples located horizontally left and subsequently the vertically stacked ones on x=0.\n- **RIGHT** (7, 2): It doesn't get me closer to any apple, and leads me toward the edge of the board, with no current apple in that direction. \n\n**Strategizing for Future Turns:**\nAim to gather the apples on the left first, since they cluster together, making it efficient to gather multiple in succession. Monitor the movements of other snakes in case their trajectories conflict with my path.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best next move is to start heading left, ultimately aiming for the collection of apples along the x=0 line. \n\nTherefore, my move this turn is: **LEFT**."

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible to grow and gain points. Here are the coordinates of the apples: (1, 0), (3, 8), (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8).\n\n**Immediate Observations:**\n1. Apples on the Left: There are three apples stacked vertically at x=0, specifically at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8). Additionally, another apple is at (1, 0).\n2. Apple on the Top-Left: There's an apple at (3, 8), which is relatively distant from my current position.\n3.

Also, it provides some maneuverability as I get closer to the apples on x=0.\n- **DOWN** (6, 1): Moving down doesn't bring any immediate benefit, and it actually takes me further away from all available apples.\n- **LEFT** (5, 2): This move heads toward the apple at (1, 0). It's a direct path to collect apples located horizontally left and subsequently the vertically stacked ones on x=0.\n- **RIGHT** (7, 2): It doesn't get me closer to any apple, and leads me toward the edge of the board, with no current apple in that direction. \n\n**Strategizing for Future Turns:**\nAim to gather the apples on the left first, since they cluster together, making it efficient to gather multiple in succession. Monitor the movements of other snakes in case their trajectories conflict with my path.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best next move is to start heading left, ultimately aiming for the collection of apples along the x=0 line. \n\nTherefore, my move this turn is: **LEFT**."

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible to grow and gain points. Here are the coordinates of the apples: (1, 0), (3, 8), (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8).\n\n**Immediate Observations:**\n1. Apples on the Left: There are three apples stacked vertically at x=0, specifically at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8). Additionally, another apple is at (1, 0).\n2. Apple on the Top-Left: There's an apple at (3, 8), which is relatively distant from my current position.\n3.

Also, it provides some maneuverability as I get closer to the apples on x=0.\n- **DOWN** (6, 1): Moving down doesn't bring any immediate benefit, and it actually takes me further away from all available apples.\n- **LEFT** (5, 2): This move heads toward the apple at (1, 0). It's a direct path to collect apples located horizontally left and subsequently the vertically stacked ones on x=0.\n- **RIGHT** (7, 2): It doesn't get me closer to any apple, and leads me toward the edge of the board, with no current apple in that direction. \n\n**Strategizing for Future Turns:**\nAim to gather the apples on the left first, since they cluster together, making it efficient to gather multiple in succession. Monitor the movements of other snakes in case their trajectories conflict with my path.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best next move is to start heading left, ultimately aiming for the collection of apples along the x=0 line. \n\nTherefore, my move this turn is: **LEFT**."

Apples on the Left: There are three apples stacked vertically at x=0, specifically at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8). Additionally, another apple is at (1, 0).\n2. Apple on the Top-Left: There's an apple at (3, 8), which is relatively distant from my current position.\n3. Enemy Snake: Snake #2 is at (9, 9), far away from me, so it's not an immediate threat.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n- **UP** (6, 3): This move doesn't bring me closer to an apple immediately, but it's the start toward reaching the upper apples like (3, 8). Also, it provides some maneuverability as I get closer to the apples on x=0.\n- **DOWN** (6, 1): Moving down doesn't bring any immediate benefit, and it actually takes me further away from all available apples.\n- **LEFT** (5, 2): This move heads toward the apple at (1, 0). It's a direct path to collect apples located horizontally left and subsequently the vertically stacked ones on x=0.\n- **RIGHT** (7, 2): It doesn't get me closer to any apple, and leads me toward the edge of the board, with no current apple in that direction. \n\n**Strategizing for Future Turns:**\nAim to gather the apples on the left first, since they cluster together, making it efficient to gather multiple in succession. Monitor the movements of other snakes in case their trajectories conflict with my path.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best next move is to start heading left, ultimately aiming for the collection of apples along the x=0 line. \n\nTherefore, my move this turn is: **LEFT**."

Apples on the Left: There are three apples stacked vertically at x=0, specifically at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8). Additionally, another apple is at (1, 0).\n2.

It's a direct path to collect apples located horizontally left and subsequently the vertically stacked ones on x=0.\n- **RIGHT** (7, 2): It doesn't get me closer to any apple, and leads me toward the edge of the board, with no current apple in that direction. \n\n**Strategizing for Future Turns:**\nAim to gather the apples on the left first, since they cluster together, making it efficient to gather multiple in succession. Monitor the movements of other snakes in case their trajectories conflict with my path.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best next move is to start heading left, ultimately aiming for the collection of apples along the x=0 line. \n\nTherefore, my move this turn is: **LEFT**."

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible to grow and gain points. Here are the coordinates of the apples: (1, 0), (3, 8), (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8).\n\n**Immediate Observations:**\n1. Apples on the Left: There are three apples stacked vertically at x=0, specifically at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 8). Additionally, another apple is at (1, 0).\n2. Apple on the Top-Left: There's an apple at (3, 8), which is relatively distant from my current position.\n3. Enemy Snake: Snake #2 is at (9, 9), far away from me, so it's not an immediate threat.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n- **UP** (6, 3): This move doesn't bring me closer to an apple immediately, but it's the start toward reaching the upper apples like (3, 8). Also, it provides some maneuverability as I get closer to the apples on x=0.\n- **DOWN** (6, 1): Moving down doesn't bring any immediate benefit, and it actually takes me further away from all available apples.\n- **LEFT** (5, 2): This move heads toward the apple at (1, 0). It's a direct path to collect apples located horizontally left and subsequently the vertically stacked ones on x=0.\n- **RIGHT** (7, 2): It doesn't get me closer to any apple, and leads me toward the edge of the board, with no current apple in that direction. \n\n**Strategizing for Future Turns:**\nAim to gather the apples on the left first, since they cluster together, making it efficient to gather multiple in succession. Monitor the movements of other snakes in case their trajectories conflict with my path.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best next move is to start heading left, ultimately aiming for the collection of apples along the x=0 line. \n\nTherefore, my move this turn is: **LEFT**."
