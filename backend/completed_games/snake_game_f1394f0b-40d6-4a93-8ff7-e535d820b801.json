This maneuver avoids enemy confrontation and secures immediate points.\n   - Post securing this apple, I can then re-route upwards to target the apple at (5, 2) or push further to y-coordinate 5 where three apples are aligned.\n\n4. **Safety and Strategic Expansion**:\n   - Moving LEFT also keeps me away from boundaries and provides ample room to assess and adapt to Snake #2's movements. This path ensures safety from the boundary while approaching the target.\n\n**Strategy for Future Rounds**:\n- After collecting the apple at (5, 1), evaluate the movement of Snake #2 before advancing further.
