            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,7). There are apples at (0,6), (7,3), (0,4), (3,3), and (1,9). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (7,7), which is towards the top-right part of the board. The enemy snake is at (9,6), which is even more to the right but a bit lower than me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,6): that's all the way to the left, middle-high on the Y-axis.\n\n- (7,3): that's directly below me, at the same X coordinate.\n\n- (0,4): again on the left side, a bit lower than the first apple.\n\n- (3,3): moving towards the center.\n\n- (1,9): top row, second from the left.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also the position of the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,7) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,6): |7-0| + |7-6| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |7-3| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- To (0,4): |7-0| + |7-4| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,3): |7-3| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (1,9): |7-1| + |7-9| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), only 4 moves away. The others are farther, between 8 to 10 moves.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (9,6), which is closer to some of the apples than I am. For example, the apple at (0,6) is 9 units away from the enemy (|9-0| + |6-6| = 9 + 0 = 9), while it's 8 units away for me. Similarly, the apple at (0,4) is |9-0| + |6-4| = 9 + 2 = 11 for the enemy, and 10 for me. So, in these cases, I might have a slight advantage in reaching them before the enemy.\n\nHowever, the apple at (7,3) is only 4 moves away for me, and the enemy is at (9,6), which is |9-7| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves away. So, I can reach it before the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (3,3) is 8 moves for me and |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9 for the enemy, so again, I can reach it slightly faster.\n\nThe apple at (1,9) is 6 + 2 = 8 for me, and |9-1| + |6-9| = 8 + 3 = 11 for the enemy. So, I have a clear advantage there.\n\nBut, considering the distances, going for the apple at (7,3) makes the most sense because it's the closest. Also, moving down towards it won't bring me closer to the enemy; in fact, it moves me away slightly.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3) from (7,7). Since the X coordinate is the same, I just need to move down 4 steps.\n\nSo, I can start by moving DOWN.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . A . .\n\nSo, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), which has an apple (A). Then,\u7ee7\u7eed\u5411\u4e0b\u5230(7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3), which also has an apple.\n\nWait a minute, the apple at (7,3) is already there, but according to the board state, there's another apple at (3,3). So, maybe there are multiple apples.\n\nBut in the path from (7,7) to (7,3), I'll pass by (7,6) which has an apple. So, if I move down to (7,6), I'll pick up that apple, grow, and then continue down to (7,5), (7,4), and (7,3).\n\nAt (7,3), there's another apple, so I'll pick that up as well.\n\nThis seems straightforward. However, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,6), and I'm moving down to (7,6), then (7,5), etc., it shouldn't be a problem unless the enemy decides to move towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume the enemy will stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I grow by picking up apples, I'll have a longer body, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body parts.\n\nBut in this straight path down, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up multiple apples in one go, but given the positions, going straight down to (7,3) seems the most efficient.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after picking up the apples at (7,6) and (7,3), there might be other apples to go for next.\n\nLooking at the board, after reaching (7,3), I could consider moving left towards (0,4) or (0,6), but that would be a longer journey.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for the apple at (3,3), which is nearby.\n\nWait, at (3,3), there's an apple, but to get from (7,3) to (3,3), I need to move left 4 steps.\n\nBut I need to see if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nFrom (7,3), moving left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3).\n\nLooking at the board, row 3: . . . A . . . A . .\n\nSo, positions (3,3) and (7,3) have apples, and presumably, the cells in between are empty.\n\nSo, after picking up the apple at (7,3), I could continue left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, when I pick up the apple at (7,6), I grow, and then at (7,3), I grow again.\n\nSo, my body will extend accordingly.\n\nBut in a straight path, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up the apple at (7,3) and then moving up or down to another apple.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (1,9), which is upwards and to the left.\n\nBut that would require a longer journey.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples that are closer in the current area is better.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (9,6), if I move down to (7,6), (7,5), etc., the enemy might try to intercept me or go for another apple.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my initial plan.\n\nSo, first move: DOWN to (7,6) to pick up the apple there.\n\nThen, continue DOWN to (7,5), then (7,4), then (7,3) to pick up another apple.\n\nAfter that, consider moving left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3) to pick up the apple there.\n\nThen, perhaps look towards (0,4) or (0,6).\n\nBut, this might be too ambitious for now.\n\nI should take it step by step.\n\nFirst, ensure I pick up the apple at (7,6).\n\nThen, proceed to (7,3).\n\nAfter that, see the situation again.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements.\n\nBut for the immediate next move, I'll choose to move DOWN to (7,6).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,6). There are apples at (0,6), (7,3), (0,4), (3,3), and (1,9). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,7), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (7,6), which is towards the top-right part of the board. The enemy snake is at (9,7), which is even more to the right but almost at the same Y level as me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,6): that's all the way to the left, middle-high on the Y-axis.\n\n- (7,3): that's directly below me, a few rows down.\n\n- (0,4): again on the left side, a bit lower than the first apple.\n\n- (3,3): moving towards the center.\n\n- (1,9): top row, second from the left.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also the position of the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,6): |7-0| + |6-6| = 7 + 0 = 7\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (0,4): |7-0| + |6-4| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n- To (3,3): |7-3| + |6-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- To (1,9): |7-1| + |6-9| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), only 3 moves away. The others are farther, between 7 to 9 moves.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (9,7), which is closer to some of the apples than I am. For example, the apple at (0,6) is |9-0| + |7-6| = 9 + 1 = 10 for the enemy, while it's 7 for me. Similarly, the apple at (0,4) is |9-0| + |7-4| = 9 + 3 = 12 for the enemy, and 9 for me. So, in these cases, I have an advantage in reaching them before the enemy.\n\nHowever, the apple at (7,3) is only 3 moves away for me, and the enemy is at (9,7), which is |9-7| + |7-3| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves away. So, I can reach it before the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (3,3) is 7 moves for me and |9-3| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10 for the enemy, so again, I can reach it faster.\n\nThe apple at (1,9) is 6 + 3 = 9 for me, and |9-1| + |7-9| = 8 + 2 = 10 for the enemy. So, I have an advantage there as well.\n\nBut, considering the distances, going for the apple at (7,3) makes the most sense because it's the closest. Also, moving down towards it won't bring me closer to the enemy; in fact, it moves me away slightly.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3) from (7,6). Since the X coordinate is the same, I just need to move down 3 steps.\n\nSo, I can start by moving DOWN.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . A . .\n\nSo, from (7,6), moving down to (7,5), then (7,4), and finally (7,3), which has an apple.\n\nI need to ensure that as I move down, I don't run into my own body. Since I'm moving straight down, and assuming I grow by picking up the apple at (7,6), my body will extend, but in a straight line, so I should be fine.\n\nAfter picking up the apple at (7,3), I can consider my next move. At that point, I'll have two apples under my belt, and I can look at the remaining apples and the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up the apple at (7,3), I could consider moving left towards (3,3), where there's another apple.\n\nFrom (7,3), moving left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3). Looking at the board, row 3 has apples at (3,3) and (7,3), with empty spaces in between.\n\nSo, that seems feasible.\n\nAfter picking up the apple at (3,3), I could then consider moving up towards (1,9), but that would be a longer journey.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (0,4) or (0,6), which are both on the left side.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is on the right side, moving left might be a safer option, away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious because as I grow longer, I have to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path.\n\nBut for now, I'll focus on picking up the apple at (7,3).\n\nSo, my immediate plan is to move down to (7,5), then (7,4), and finally (7,3).\n\nAfter that, I'll consider moving left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3) to pick up another apple.\n\nThen, perhaps look towards (0,4) or (0,6).\n\nBut, let's take it one step at a time.\n\nFor the next move, I'll choose to move DOWN to (7,5).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

The others are farther, between 8 to 10 moves.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (9,6), which is closer to some of the apples than I am. For example, the apple at (0,6) is 9 units away from the enemy (|9-0| + |6-6| = 9 + 0 = 9), while it's 8 units away for me. Similarly, the apple at (0,4) is |9-0| + |6-4| = 9 + 2 = 11 for the enemy, and 10 for me. So, in these cases, I might have a slight advantage in reaching them before the enemy.\n\nHowever, the apple at (7,3) is only 4 moves away for me, and the enemy is at (9,6), which is |9-7| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves away. So, I can reach it before the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (3,3) is 8 moves for me and |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9 for the enemy, so again, I can reach it slightly faster.\n\nThe apple at (1,9) is 6 + 2 = 8 for me, and |9-1| + |6-9| = 8 + 3 = 11 for the enemy. So, I have a clear advantage there.\n\nBut, considering the distances, going for the apple at (7,3) makes the most sense because it's the closest. Also, moving down towards it won't bring me closer to the enemy; in fact, it moves me away slightly.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3) from (7,7).

A . .\n\nSo, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), which has an apple (A). Then,\u7ee7\u7eed\u5411\u4e0b\u5230(7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3), which also has an apple.\n\nWait a minute, the apple at (7,3) is already there, but according to the board state, there's another apple at (3,3). So, maybe there are multiple apples.\n\nBut in the path from (7,7) to (7,3), I'll pass by (7,6) which has an apple. So, if I move down to (7,6), I'll pick up that apple, grow, and then continue down to (7,5), (7,4), and (7,3).\n\nAt (7,3), there's another apple, so I'll pick that up as well.\n\nThis seems straightforward. However, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,6), and I'm moving down to (7,6), then (7,5), etc., it shouldn't be a problem unless the enemy decides to move towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume the enemy will stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I grow by picking up apples, I'll have a longer body, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body parts.\n\nBut in this straight path down, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up multiple apples in one go, but given the positions, going straight down to (7,3) seems the most efficient.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after picking up the apples at (7,6) and (7,3), there might be other apples to go for next.\n\nLooking at the board, after reaching (7,3), I could consider moving left towards (0,4) or (0,6), but that would be a longer journey.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for the apple at (3,3), which is nearby.\n\nWait, at (3,3), there's an apple, but to get from (7,3) to (3,3), I need to move left 4 steps.\n\nBut I need to see if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nFrom (7,3), moving left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3).\n\nLooking at the board, row 3: . . . A . . . A . .\n\nSo, positions (3,3) and (7,3) have apples, and presumably, the cells in between are empty.\n\nSo, after picking up the apple at (7,3), I could continue left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, when I pick up the apple at (7,6), I grow, and then at (7,3), I grow again.\n\nSo, my body will extend accordingly.\n\nBut in a straight path, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up the apple at (7,3) and then moving up or down to another apple.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (1,9), which is upwards and to the left.\n\nBut that would require a longer journey.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples that are closer in the current area is better.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (9,6), if I move down to (7,6), (7,5), etc., the enemy might try to intercept me or go for another apple.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my initial plan.\n\nSo, first move: DOWN to (7,6) to pick up the apple there.\n\nThen, continue DOWN to (7,5), then (7,4), then (7,3) to pick up another apple.\n\nAfter that, consider moving left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3) to pick up the apple there.\n\nThen, perhaps look towards (0,4) or (0,6).\n\nBut, this might be too ambitious for now.\n\nI should take it step by step.\n\nFirst, ensure I pick up the apple at (7,6).\n\nThen, proceed to (7,3).\n\nAfter that, see the situation again.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements.\n\nBut for the immediate next move, I'll choose to move DOWN to (7,6).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

So, from (7,5), I need to move down to (7,4), and then to (7,3).\n\nLet me check the board again:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . A . .\n\nSo, at (7,5), which is row 5, column 7, I see that it's empty except for my snake's head. The position below me at (7,4) should be empty, and then (7,3) has an apple.\n\nI need to make sure that as I move down, I don't run into anything. Since I'm moving straight down and there are no obstacles in that path, it should be safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,8), which is towards the bottom-right corner. If I move down to (7,4), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good because I don't want to collide with it.\n\nAfter reaching (7,3), I can pick up the apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider my next move. Maybe go left towards (3,3), another apple position.\n\nBut let's not think too far ahead. For now, my immediate goal is to reach (7,3).\n\nSo, from (7,5), I need to move down to (7,4), and then to (7,3).\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (7,4).\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved from (7,6) to (7,5), which is down. Now, from (7,5), moving down to (7,4).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or anything like that. Since I'm moving straight down and my body is extending behind me, I should be fine as long as I continue moving in a straight line.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on the enemy's movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving down to (7,4).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,7). There are apples at (0,6), (7,3), (0,4), (3,3), and (1,9). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (9,6), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (7,7), which is towards the top-right part of the board. The enemy snake is at (9,6), which is even more to the right but a bit lower than me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,6): that's all the way to the left, middle-high on the Y-axis.\n\n- (7,3): that's directly below me, at the same X coordinate.\n\n- (0,4): again on the left side, a bit lower than the first apple.\n\n- (3,3): moving towards the center.\n\n- (1,9): top row, second from the left.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also the position of the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,7) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,6): |7-0| + |7-6| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |7-3| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- To (0,4): |7-0| + |7-4| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,3): |7-3| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (1,9): |7-1| + |7-9| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), only 4 moves away. The others are farther, between 8 to 10 moves.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (9,6), which is closer to some of the apples than I am. For example, the apple at (0,6) is 9 units away from the enemy (|9-0| + |6-6| = 9 + 0 = 9), while it's 8 units away for me. Similarly, the apple at (0,4) is |9-0| + |6-4| = 9 + 2 = 11 for the enemy, and 10 for me. So, in these cases, I might have a slight advantage in reaching them before the enemy.\n\nHowever, the apple at (7,3) is only 4 moves away for me, and the enemy is at (9,6), which is |9-7| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves away. So, I can reach it before the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (3,3) is 8 moves for me and |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9 for the enemy, so again, I can reach it slightly faster.\n\nThe apple at (1,9) is 6 + 2 = 8 for me, and |9-1| + |6-9| = 8 + 3 = 11 for the enemy. So, I have a clear advantage there.\n\nBut, considering the distances, going for the apple at (7,3) makes the most sense because it's the closest. Also, moving down towards it won't bring me closer to the enemy; in fact, it moves me away slightly.\n\nLet me plot a path to (7,3) from (7,7). Since the X coordinate is the same, I just need to move down 4 steps.\n\nSo, I can start by moving DOWN.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . A . .\n\nSo, from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), which has an apple (A). Then,\u7ee7\u7eed\u5411\u4e0b\u5230(7,5), (7,4), and finally (7,3), which also has an apple.\n\nWait a minute, the apple at (7,3) is already there, but according to the board state, there's another apple at (3,3). So, maybe there are multiple apples.\n\nBut in the path from (7,7) to (7,3), I'll pass by (7,6) which has an apple. So, if I move down to (7,6), I'll pick up that apple, grow, and then continue down to (7,5), (7,4), and (7,3).\n\nAt (7,3), there's another apple, so I'll pick that up as well.\n\nThis seems straightforward. However, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,6), and I'm moving down to (7,6), then (7,5), etc., it shouldn't be a problem unless the enemy decides to move towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume the enemy will stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I grow by picking up apples, I'll have a longer body, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body parts.\n\nBut in this straight path down, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up multiple apples in one go, but given the positions, going straight down to (7,3) seems the most efficient.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after picking up the apples at (7,6) and (7,3), there might be other apples to go for next.\n\nLooking at the board, after reaching (7,3), I could consider moving left towards (0,4) or (0,6), but that would be a longer journey.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for the apple at (3,3), which is nearby.\n\nWait, at (3,3), there's an apple, but to get from (7,3) to (3,3), I need to move left 4 steps.\n\nBut I need to see if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nFrom (7,3), moving left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3).\n\nLooking at the board, row 3: . . . A . . . A . .\n\nSo, positions (3,3) and (7,3) have apples, and presumably, the cells in between are empty.\n\nSo, after picking up the apple at (7,3), I could continue left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, when I pick up the apple at (7,6), I grow, and then at (7,3), I grow again.\n\nSo, my body will extend accordingly.\n\nBut in a straight path, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up the apple at (7,3) and then moving up or down to another apple.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (1,9), which is upwards and to the left.\n\nBut that would require a longer journey.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples that are closer in the current area is better.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (9,6), if I move down to (7,6), (7,5), etc., the enemy might try to intercept me or go for another apple.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with my initial plan.\n\nSo, first move: DOWN to (7,6) to pick up the apple there.\n\nThen, continue DOWN to (7,5), then (7,4), then (7,3) to pick up another apple.\n\nAfter that, consider moving left to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3) to pick up the apple there.\n\nThen, perhaps look towards (0,4) or (0,6).\n\nBut, this might be too ambitious for now.\n\nI should take it step by step.\n\nFirst, ensure I pick up the apple at (7,6).\n\nThen, proceed to (7,3).\n\nAfter that, see the situation again.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements.\n\nBut for the immediate next move, I'll choose to move DOWN to (7,6).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

Got it.\n\nNow, looking at the board, the apples are at (0,6), (7,3), (0,4), (3,3), and (1,9). The enemy snake, number 1, is at (9,9), and it has no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for next. Since I just moved down to (7,4), my goal was to get to (7,3), the apple directly below me. So, from (7,4), I need to move down to (7,3).\n\nLet me check the board again:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . A . .\n\nSo, at (7,4), which is row 4, column 7, I see that it's empty except for my snake's head. The position below me at (7,3) has an apple.\n\nI need to make sure that as I move down, I don't run into anything. Since I'm moving straight down and there are no obstacles in that path, it should be safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,9), which is towards the top-right corner. If I move down to (7,3), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good because I don't want to collide with it.\n\nAfter reaching (7,3), I can pick up the apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider my next move. Maybe go left towards (3,3), another apple position.\n\nBut let's not think too far ahead. For now, my immediate goal is to reach (7,3).\n\nSo, from (7,4), I need to move down to (7,3).\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (7,3).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or anything like that. Since I'm moving straight down and my body is extending behind me, I should be fine as long as I continue moving in a straight line.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on the enemy's movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving down to (7,3).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n- **Snake Position:** (7,4)\n\n- **Apples:** (0,6), (7,3), (0,4), (3,3), (1,9)\n\n- **Enemy Snake:** (9,9)\n\n**Objective:**\n\n- Collect apples to gain points while avoiding walls, other snakes, and\u81ea\u8eab\u3002\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Closest Apples:** Focus on apples that are closest to minimize exposure and reduce the chance of collisions.\n\n2. **Path Clearance:** Ensure the path to the chosen apple is clear and doesn't lead to immediate danger.\n\n3. **Avoid Enemy Snakes:** Stay away from enemy snakes to prevent collisions.\n\n4. **Plan Ahead:** Consider the next apple to go for after the current one to maintain momentum.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Current Position:** (7,4)\n\n- **Target Apple:** (7,3) \u2013 directly below the current position.\n\n- **Path to Apple:** Only one step down to (7,3).\n\n- **Obstacles:** None in the direct path.\n\n- **Enemy Position:** (9,9) \u2013 relatively far away in the top-right corner.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Move DOWN to (7,4) \u2192 (7,3) to collect the apple.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The path is clear and straightforward.\n\n- The apple is adjacent, minimizing risk.\n\n- The enemy is distant, reducing immediate threat.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- After collecting (7,3), consider moving left towards (3,3).\n\n- Monitor enemy movements to adjust strategy if necessary.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"
