If I would later move up from (7, 2) to (7, 3), I would collide with the enemy snake.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Moving UP to (8, 3) is safe and prepares to reach the apple at (8, 4) on the next move.\n   - Any move to the left (like to (7, 2)) could potentially lead into danger against the enemy snake.\n\nConsidering all of the above points, it makes the most sense to move UP to (8, 3) and then plan to grab the apple at (8, 4) in the next turn. The enemy snake\u2019s proximity makes avoiding unnecessary confrontations essential.\n\nMy decided next move: UP."

The enemy snake is at (8, 2), but since it has no body, moving to (8, 3) is safe.\n   - **Proximity to Apples:** Directly adjacent to the apple at (8, 4), just 1 step away after moving right.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Closest Apple:** The apple at (8, 4) is the nearest, requiring only a move to the right followed by an upward move.\n- **Enemy Position:** Moving right keeps a safe distance from the enemy snake at (8, 2), minimizing immediate collision risks.\n- **Future Moves:** Positioning towards (8, 4) allows for a quick gain in points and maintains flexibility for subsequent moves, either towards (7, 8) or (8, 4) depending on the game state after consuming the apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (8, 3) is the optimal choice to quickly reach the nearest apple while maintaining safety from the enemy snake.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
