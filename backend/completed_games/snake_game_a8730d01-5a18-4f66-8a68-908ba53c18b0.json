            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,1). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (0,1), which is one unit above the bottom-left corner. There's an apple at (1,0), which is directly to my right and down one step. Another apple is at (1,2), which is right above (1,0). There are other apples farther away.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,2). But I have to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (4,0), and I don't want to run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (0,2), which is in row 2, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,0): row 0, column 5\n\nOkay, so the closest apples are (1,2) and (1,0), both just one step away from my current position.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (1,2). To get there, I can move right to (1,2), eat it, and then perhaps move up to higher rows where there are more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to (1,0), eat that apple, and then maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (5,0). It's quite a distance away, but I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apple at (1,2) first, as it's directly adjacent, and then move up towards the higher-row apples.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is also just one move down. Maybe I should consider which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (1,2): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move up to (1,3), etc., towards higher-row apples.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move down to (1,0): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move right or left from there.\n\nBut wait, (1,0) is at row 0, which is the bottom row. Moving down from there would be impossible since it's the edge of the board.\n\nSo, after eating (1,0), I'd have to move up to (1,1), then maybe to (1,2) to eat another apple.\n\nBut (1,2) is also accessible directly from my current position.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating both apples in this area before moving on.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n- Move right to (1,2), eat apple\n\n- Then move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eat apple\n\n- Now, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown.\n\n- Then, maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, when I move down from (1,2) to (1,1), then to (1,0), I need to ensure that my snake hasn't grown in such a way that the tail is in my path.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one segment at (0,2). After eating the first apple at (1,2), it will grow, so maybe I need to consider where my tail will be.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake will have an additional segment, but I need to see where that segment is.\n\nAssuming that the tail remains stationary until the next move, when I move to (1,2), my tail stays at (0,2), and then after moving, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward with each move, and when you eat an apple, the tail stays in place instead of moving back.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,1). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (0,1), which is one unit above the bottom-left corner. There's an apple at (1,0), which is directly to my right and down one step. Another apple is at (1,2), which is right above (1,0). There are other apples farther away.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,2). But I have to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (4,0), and I don't want to run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,1). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (0,1), which is one unit above the bottom-left corner. There's an apple at (1,0), which is directly to my right and down one step. Another apple is at (1,2), which is right above (1,0). There are other apples farther away.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,2). But I have to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (4,0), and I don't want to run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully, considering both the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (0,2), which is in row 2, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,0): row 0, column 5\n\nOkay, so the closest apples are (1,2) and (1,0), both just one step away from my current position.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (1,2). To get there, I can move right to (1,2), eat it, and then perhaps move up to higher rows where there are more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to (1,0), eat that apple, and then maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (5,0). It's quite a distance away, but I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apple at (1,2) first, as it's directly adjacent, and then move up towards the higher-row apples.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is also just one move down. Maybe I should consider which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (1,2): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move up to (1,3), etc., towards higher-row apples.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move down to (1,0): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move right or left from there.\n\nBut wait, (1,0) is at row 0, which is the bottom row. Moving down from there would be impossible since it's the edge of the board.\n\nSo, after eating (1,0), I'd have to move up to (1,1), then maybe to (1,2) to eat another apple.\n\nBut (1,2) is also accessible directly from my current position.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating both apples in this area before moving on.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n- Move right to (1,2), eat apple\n\n- Then move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eat apple\n\n- Now, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown.\n\n- Then, maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, when I move down from (1,2) to (1,1), then to (1,0), I need to ensure that my snake hasn't grown in such a way that the tail is in my path.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one segment at (0,2). After eating the first apple at (1,2), it will grow, so maybe I need to consider where my tail will be.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake will have an additional segment, but I need to see where that segment is.\n\nAssuming that the tail remains stationary until the next move, when I move to (1,2), my tail stays at (0,2), and then after moving, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward with each move, and when you eat an apple, the tail stays in place instead of moving back.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the sequence in which I can eat multiple apples.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board.\n\nRows 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9.\n\nMy snake is at (0,3).\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (3,8)\n\n- (4,9)\n\n- (8,6)\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat apples in a sequence that maximizes the number I can eat.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating the apples in order of increasing distance, but also considering the positions of other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider which apples are clustered together and go for those first.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (1,2) and (1,0) are relatively close to each other.\n\n- (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6) are farther away and more spread out.\n\nMaybe I should go for the cluster of apples at (1,2) and (1,0) first, since they are closer and close to each other.\n\nFrom my current position at (0,3), I can move right to (1,3), then up to (1,2) to eat the first apple.\n\nThen, from (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then to (1,0) to eat the second apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating those two, I can consider moving to the other apples.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1), which is at (6,1). I need to keep an eye on its position and avoid it.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move immediately, I can plan my path accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move every turn, so I need to anticipate their movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nTherefore, I should try to minimize the time I'm on the board, eating as many apples as possible before the enemy snake can interfere.\n\nGiven that, going for the closest apples first makes sense.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move right to (1,3)\n\n- Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n- Move down to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating these two apples, I can consider moving to the next cluster.\n\nBut before that, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way or if the"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,1). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (0,1), which is one unit above the bottom-left corner. There's an apple at (1,0), which is directly to my right and down one step. Another apple is at (1,2), which is right above (1,0). There are other apples farther away.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,2). But I have to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (4,0), and I don't want to run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully, considering both the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

To get there, I can move right to (1,2), eat it, and then perhaps move up to higher rows where there are more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to (1,0), eat that apple, and then maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (5,0). It's quite a distance away, but I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apple at (1,2) first, as it's directly adjacent, and then move up towards the higher-row apples.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is also just one move down. Maybe I should consider which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (1,2): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move up to (1,3), etc., towards higher-row apples.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move down to (1,0): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move right or left from there.\n\nBut wait, (1,0) is at row 0, which is the bottom row. Moving down from there would be impossible since it's the edge of the board.\n\nSo, after eating (1,0), I'd have to move up to (1,1), then maybe to (1,2) to eat another apple.\n\nBut (1,2) is also accessible directly from my current position.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating both apples in this area before moving on.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n- Move right to (1,2), eat apple\n\n- Then move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eat apple\n\n- Now, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown.\n\n- Then, maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, when I move down from (1,2) to (1,1), then to (1,0), I need to ensure that my snake hasn't grown in such a way that the tail is in my path.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one segment at (0,2). After eating the first apple at (1,2), it will grow, so maybe I need to consider where my tail will be.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake will have an additional segment, but I need to see where that segment is.\n\nAssuming that the tail remains stationary until the next move, when I move to (1,2), my tail stays at (0,2), and then after moving, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward with each move, and when you eat an apple, the tail stays in place instead of moving back.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully, considering both the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

To get there, I can move right to (1,2), eat it, and then perhaps move up to higher rows where there are more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to (1,0), eat that apple, and then maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (5,0). It's quite a distance away, but I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apple at (1,2) first, as it's directly adjacent, and then move up towards the higher-row apples.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is also just one move down. Maybe I should consider which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (1,2): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move up to (1,3), etc., towards higher-row apples.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move down to (1,0): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move right or left from there.\n\nBut wait, (1,0) is at row 0, which is the bottom row. Moving down from there would be impossible since it's the edge of the board.\n\nSo, after eating (1,0), I'd have to move up to (1,1), then maybe to (1,2) to eat another apple.\n\nBut (1,2) is also accessible directly from my current position.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating both apples in this area before moving on.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n- Move right to (1,2), eat apple\n\n- Then move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eat apple\n\n- Now, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown.\n\n- Then, maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, when I move down from (1,2) to (1,1), then to (1,0), I need to ensure that my snake hasn't grown in such a way that the tail is in my path.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one segment at (0,2). After eating the first apple at (1,2), it will grow, so maybe I need to consider where my tail will be.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake will have an additional segment, but I need to see where that segment is.\n\nAssuming that the tail remains stationary until the next move, when I move to (1,2), my tail stays at (0,2), and then after moving, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward with each move, and when you eat an apple, the tail stays in place instead of moving back.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

I need to correct that.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,0): row 6, column 0.\n\nOkay, now I have the correct positions.\n\nSo, I'm at (3,0), and I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet me plot this out.\n\nI'm at (3,0).

There might be a mistake in the board or the positions.\n\nLet me assume that positions are (row, column), so my position is (3,0), and the enemy is at (6,0).\n\nLooking back at the board, row 6, column 0 is empty, but row 0, column 4 has '1'. Maybe the enemy snake has a body part or something.\n\nBut in the description, it says the enemy snake is at (6,1) with body at [].

I need to keep an eye on its position and avoid it.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move immediately, I can plan my path accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move every turn, so I need to anticipate their movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nTherefore, I should try to minimize the time I'm on the board, eating as many apples as possible before the enemy snake can interfere.\n\nGiven that, going for the closest apples first makes sense.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move right to (1,3)\n\n- Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n- Move down to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating these two apples, I can consider moving to the next cluster.\n\nBut before that, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way or if the"

I need to keep an eye on its position and avoid it.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move immediately, I can plan my path accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move every turn, so I need to anticipate their movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nTherefore, I should try to minimize the time I'm on the board, eating as many apples as possible before the enemy snake can interfere.\n\nGiven that, going for the closest apples first makes sense.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move right to (1,3)\n\n- Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n- Move down to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating these two apples, I can consider moving to the next cluster.\n\nBut before that, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way or if the enemy snake might have moved into my path.\n\nAlso, after eating the first apple at (1,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't immediately cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a body length of 1 after eating the first apple, I need to ensure that the next moves don't lead me back to the starting position or into my own tail.\n\nMoreover, I need to consider that the enemy snake might be moving"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,1). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (0,1), which is one unit above the bottom-left corner. There's an apple at (1,0), which is directly to my right and down one step. Another apple is at (1,2), which is right above (1,0). There are other apples farther away.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,2). But I have to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (4,0), and I don't want to run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

To get there, I can move right to (1,2), eat it, and then perhaps move up to higher rows where there are more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to (1,0), eat that apple, and then maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (5,0). It's quite a distance away, but I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apple at (1,2) first, as it's directly adjacent, and then move up towards the higher-row apples.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is also just one move down. Maybe I should consider which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (1,2): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move up to (1,3), etc., towards higher-row apples.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move down to (1,0): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move right or left from there.\n\nBut wait, (1,0) is at row 0, which is the bottom row. Moving down from there would be impossible since it's the edge of the board.\n\nSo, after eating (1,0), I'd have to move up to (1,1), then maybe to (1,2) to eat another apple.\n\nBut (1,2) is also accessible directly from my current position.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating both apples in this area before moving on.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n- Move right to (1,2), eat apple\n\n- Then move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eat apple\n\n- Now, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown.\n\n- Then, maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, when I move down from (1,2) to (1,1), then to (1,0), I need to ensure that my snake hasn't grown in such a way that the tail is in my path.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one segment at (0,2). After eating the first apple at (1,2), it will grow, so maybe I need to consider where my tail will be.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake will have an additional segment, but I need to see where that segment is.\n\nAssuming that the tail remains stationary until the next move, when I move to (1,2), my tail stays at (0,2), and then after moving, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward with each move, and when you eat an apple, the tail stays in place instead of moving back.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

The apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,0), which is in row 0, column 6.\n\nWait, row 0, column 6 is where the enemy snake is, but in the board, row 0, column 4 has '1', which seems to be the enemy snake.\n\nWait, there's some confusion here. In the board, row 0, column 4 has '1', but the enemy snake is at (6,0), which is row 6, column 0.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the coordinates.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

Let me check.\n\nIf (6,0) means row 6, column 0, but in the board, row 0, column 4 has '1'.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Maybe the positions are (x,y) as in column, row.\n\nLet me assume that positions are (x,y), with x being column and y being row.\n\nSo, my position is (0,3), which is column 0, row 3.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (0,1)\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (6,8)\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,6), which is column 0, row 6.\n\nLooking back at the board, row 6, column 0 is '.', but row 0, column 4 has '1'.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the positions are (row, column).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf my position is (3,0), which is row 3, column 0, which matches the board.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 1, column 2\n\n- (1,0): row 1, column 0\n\n- (3,8): row 3, column 8\n\n- (4,9): row 4, column 9\n\n- (8,6): row 8, column 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,0): row 6, column 0.\n\nIn the board, row 6, column 0 is '.', but row 0, column 4 has '1'.

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (0,3). Wait, in the board state, it shows my snake at (0,3), but in the description, it says (0,2). Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

Wait, that doesn't match with the description. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, in the board, row 3, column 0 has '2', which is me. So, my position is (3,0), not (0,2). Maybe there was a confusion in the coordinates.\n\nLet me clarify: in this grid, rows are numbered from 0 at the bottom to 9 at the top, and columns from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (3,0), not (0,2) as I initially thought. I need to correct that.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,0): row 6, column 0.\n\nWait, in the board, row 0, column 4 has '1', which seems to be the enemy snake.\n\nBut according to the positions, the enemy snake is at (6,0). There might be a mistake in the board or the positions.\n\nLet me assume that positions are (row, column), so my position is (3,0), and the enemy is at (6,0).\n\nLooking back at the board, row 6, column 0 is empty, but row 0, column 4 has '1'. Maybe the enemy snake has a body part or something.\n\nBut in the description, it says the enemy snake is at (6,1) with body at [].\n\nWait, in the initial description, it says:\n\nEnemy snakes positions:\n\n- Snake #1 is at position (6,1) with body at []\n\nBut in the board, row 6, column 1 is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between (x,y) and (row,column). Let's assume positions are (column, row).\n\nSo, my position is (0,3), which is column 0, row 3.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (1,0): column 1, row 0\n\n- (3,8): column 3, row 8\n\n- (4,9): column 4, row 9\n\n- (8,6): column 8, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,1): column 6, row 1.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . .

A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, row 1, column 6 is '.', but row 0, column 4 has '1'. Maybe the enemy snake has moved since the board was printed.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll proceed with the positions as given in the description.\n\nSo, my position is (0,3), apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), (8,6), and enemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to find a path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet's consider the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,2): |0-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (1,0): |0-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (3,8): |0-3| + |3-8| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (4,9): |0-4| + |3-9| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (8,6): |0-8| + |3-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2) with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for that one first.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of other snakes and potential paths.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1). I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the sequence in which I can eat multiple apples.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board.\n\nRows 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9.\n\nMy snake is at (0,3).\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (3,8)\n\n- (4,9)\n\n- (8,6)\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat apples in a sequence that maximizes the number I can eat.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating the apples in order of increasing distance, but also considering the positions of other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider which apples are clustered together and go for those first.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (1,2) and (1,0) are relatively close to each other.\n\n- (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6) are farther away and more spread out.\n\nMaybe I should go for the cluster of apples at (1,2) and (1,0) first, since they are closer and close to each other.\n\nFrom my current position at (0,3), I can move right to (1,3), then up to (1,2) to eat the first apple.\n\nThen, from (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then to (1,0) to eat the second apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, I can consider moving to the other apples.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1). I need to keep an eye on its position and avoid it.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move immediately, I can plan my path accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move every turn, so I need to anticipate their movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nTherefore, I should try to minimize the time I'm on the board, eating as many apples as possible before the enemy snake can interfere.\n\nGiven that, going for the closest apples first makes sense.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move right to (1,3)\n\n- Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n- Move down to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating these two apples, I can consider moving to the next cluster.\n\nBut before that, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way or if the enemy snake might have moved into my path.\n\nAlso, after eating the first apple at (1,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't immediately cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a body length of 1 after eating the first apple, I need to ensure that the next moves don't lead me back to the starting position or into my own tail.\n\nMoreover, I need to consider that the enemy snake might be moving"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,1). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (0,1), which is one unit above the bottom-left corner. There's an apple at (1,0), which is directly to my right and down one step. Another apple is at (1,2), which is right above (1,0). There are other apples farther away.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,2). But I have to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (4,0), and I don't want to run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (0,2). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully, considering both the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . .

A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (0,2), which is in row 2, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,0): row 0, column 5\n\nOkay, so the closest apples are (1,2) and (1,0), both just one step away from my current position.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (1,2). To get there, I can move right to (1,2), eat it, and then perhaps move up to higher rows where there are more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to (1,0), eat that apple, and then maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (5,0). It's quite a distance away, but I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apple at (1,2) first, as it's directly adjacent, and then move up towards the higher-row apples.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is also just one move down. Maybe I should consider which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (1,2): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move up to (1,3), etc., towards higher-row apples.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move down to (1,0): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move right or left from there.\n\nBut wait, (1,0) is at row 0, which is the bottom row. Moving down from there would be impossible since it's the edge of the board.\n\nSo, after eating (1,0), I'd have to move up to (1,1), then maybe to (1,2) to eat another apple.\n\nBut (1,2) is also accessible directly from my current position.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating both apples in this area before moving on.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n- Move right to (1,2), eat apple\n\n- Then move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eat apple\n\n- Now, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown.\n\n- Then, maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, when I move down from (1,2) to (1,1), then to (1,0), I need to ensure that my snake hasn't grown in such a way that the tail is in my path.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one segment at (0,2). After eating the first apple at (1,2), it will grow, so maybe I need to consider where my tail will be.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake will have an additional segment, but I need to see where that segment is.\n\nAssuming that the tail remains stationary until the next move, when I move to (1,2), my tail stays at (0,2), and then after moving, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward with each move, and when you eat an apple, the tail stays in place instead of moving back.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

The apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,0), which is in row 6, column 0.\n\nWait, in the board, row 0, column 4 has '1', which seems to be the enemy snake.\n\nBut according to the positions, the enemy snake is at (6,0). There might be a mistake in the board or the positions.\n\nLet me assume that positions are (row, column), so my position is (3,0), and the enemy is at (6,0).\n\nLooking back at the board, row 6, column 0 is empty, but row 0, column 4 has '1'. Maybe the enemy snake has a body part or something.\n\nBut in the description, it says the enemy snake is at (6,1) with body at []. Wait, in the initial description, it says:\n\nEnemy snakes positions:\n\n- Snake #1 is at position (6,1) with body at []\n\nBut in the board, row 6, column 1 is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between (x,y) and (row,column). Let's assume positions are (column, row).\n\nSo, my position is (0,3), which is column 0, row 3.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (1,0): column 1, row 0\n\n- (3,8): column 3, row 8\n\n- (4,9): column 4, row 9\n\n- (8,6): column 8, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,1): column 6, row 1.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

Maybe the enemy snake has moved since the board was printed.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll proceed with the positions as given in the description.\n\nSo, my position is (0,3), apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), (8,6), and enemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to find a path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet's consider the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,2): |0-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (1,0): |0-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (3,8): |0-3| + |3-8| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (4,9): |0-4| + |3-9| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (8,6): |0-8| + |3-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2) with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for that one first.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of other snakes and potential paths.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1). I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the sequence in which I can eat multiple apples.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board.\n\nRows 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9.\n\nMy snake is at (0,3).\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (3,8)\n\n- (4,9)\n\n- (8,6)\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat apples in a sequence that maximizes the number I can eat.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating the apples in order of increasing distance, but also considering the positions of other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider which apples are clustered together and go for those first.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (1,2) and (1,0) are relatively close to each other.\n\n- (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6) are farther away and more spread out.\n\nMaybe I should go for the cluster of apples at (1,2) and (1,0) first, since they are closer and close to each other.\n\nFrom my current position at (0,3), I can move right to (1,3), then up to (1,2) to eat the first apple.\n\nThen, from (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then to (1,0) to eat the second apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating those two, I can consider moving to the other apples.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1), which is at (6,1). I need to keep an eye on its position and avoid it.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move immediately, I can plan my path accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move every turn, so I need to anticipate their movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nTherefore, I should try to minimize the time I'm on the board, eating as many apples as possible before the enemy snake can interfere.\n\nGiven that, going for the closest apples first makes sense.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move right to (1,3)\n\n- Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n- Move down to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating these two apples, I can consider moving to the next cluster.\n\nBut before that, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way or if the"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (0,1). Wait, in the board state, it shows my snake at (0,1), but in the description, it says (0,1). Okay, that's consistent.\n\nLet me look at the board again to make sure I understand the positions.\n\nBoard state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . 1 . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Up to (1,2)\n\n- To (1,0):\n\n  - Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Down to (1,0)\n\nBoth paths involve moving right to (1,1) first.\n\nAfter eating one apple, I need to decide which one to go for next.\n\nAssuming I eat (1,2) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)\n\n- After eating (1,2), my snake grows, so I need to make sure the next move doesn't lead me back to (1,1), which is now part of my body.\n\nThen, to go for (1,0):\n\n- From (1,2):\n\n  - Down to (1,1)\n\n  - Down to (1,0)\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there immediately after growing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (1,0) first.\n\nLet's consider going for (1,0) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n\n- After eating (1,0), my snake grows, so (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to go for (1,2):\n\n- From (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,1) -> but that's now part of my body, so I can't go there.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple after the first one.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples in a way that allows me to extend my path without blocking myself.\n\nLooking at the positions, the apples at (1,2) and (1,0) are in the same column, which might cause blocking if I'm not careful.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for the apple at (3,8), which is farther but might offer a clearer path if I can navigate around the enemy snake.\n\nBut that seems risky, given the distance and the presence of the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to eat both apples in the same column first, but I need to plan the order carefully.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions again.\n\nMy current position: (0,1)\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,4): row 4, column 6.\n\nI need to consider the movements step by step.\n\nFirst, to reach (1,2):\n\n- Move right to (1,1)\n\n- Move up to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my snake grows, so (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to reach (1,0):\n\n- Move down from (1,2) to (1,1) -> but (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there.\n\nSo, that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (1,0) first:\n\n- Move right to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0)\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake grows, and (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to reach (1,2):\n\n- Move up from (1,0) to (1,1) -> but (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there.\n\nAgain, a dead end.\n\nSo, it seems that eating either of these apples first blocks the path to the other.\n\nTherefore, I need to choose which apple to eat first based on the potential to reach other apples afterward.\n\nLet me consider eating (1,2) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)\n\n- After eating (1,2), my body is now at (1,1)\n\n- From (1,2), I can move right or up, but up is against the wall, so only right to (2,2)\n\n- From (2,2), I can continue right or down, but there are no apples nearby, and the enemy snake might be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, eating (1,0) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n\n- After eating (1,0), my body is now at (1,1)\n\n- From (1,0), I can move left or down, but left is against the wall, so only down to (1,-1), which is off the board.\n\nWait, row 0 is the bottom row, so moving down from (1,0) would be off the board.\n\nSo, that's invalid.\n\nTherefore, eating (1,0) first blocks me from moving further.\n\nSimilarly, eating (1,2) first blocks me from reaching (1,0).\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider not eating both of these apples in sequence.\n\nMaybe I should eat one and then look for a different apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nThese are all fairly distant, and the enemy snake is at (6,4), which might be moving towards me.\n\nI need to make a decision quickly to maximize my score.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to eat the closest apple, which is either (1,2) or (1,0), and then assess the situation.\n\nGiven that, I'll go for (1,2) first.\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (1,1)\n\n2. Move up to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body is now at (1,1)\n\nFrom (1,2), I can:\n\n- Move right to (2,2)\n\n- Move up to (1,3)\n\n- Move down to (1,1), but that's"

Let's correct that.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n- To (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n- To (1,2):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n  - Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Right to (1,2)\n\nBut actually, from (1,0), moving right to (1,1), then right to (1,2) would work, but I need to make sure that after eating (1,2), I don't block my path to other apples.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my snake would grow, so the tail would stay, and I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (1,0) first since it's closer.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Eat (1,0)\n\n   - Move up to (1,0)\n\n   - Eat the apple, snake grows\n\n2. Then go for (1,2)\n\n   - From (1,0), move right to (1,1)\n\n   - Move right to (1,2)\n\n   - Eat the apple, snake grows\n\nBut after eating (1,2), my snake would occupy (1,1), so I can't go back to (1,1).\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your body extends, so the tail stays, and the head moves forward.\n\nIn this case, after eating (1,2), my snake would have more segments, and I need to ensure I don't run into them.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe I should consider going for the closer apples first and then see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (1,0) and then look for another apple that doesn't require passing through blocked paths.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) and then go for (3,8), skipping (1,2) for now.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n- To (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n- Then to (3,8):\n\n  - Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Right to (1,2)\n\n  - ...\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Let me think about the positions again.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) first, then go for (3,8).\n\nBut (3,8) is quite far, and there are other apples closer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (1,2), then (3,8), but that seems even more distant.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) first, then look for another apple.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can then decide whether to go for (1,2) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, going from (1,0) to (1,2) might block my path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider moving up to row 1 and then look for a path to multiple apples.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nMy snake is at (0,0). Apples are at (1,0), (1,2), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). The enemy snake is at (6,5).\n\nI need to prioritize eating apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not blocking my own path.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to eat the closest apple first, which is (1,0), and then assess the situation.\n\nSo, first move up to (1,0), eat the apple, and then decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can consider moving right to (1,1), then to (1,2) to eat the next apple.\n\nBut as I thought before, this might block my path.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,0), I can move up to (2,0), and look for other apples.\n\nBut there are no apples in that direction.\n\nWait, let's look at the board again.\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . (apple at (4,9))\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . . (apple at (3,8))\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A . (apple at (8,6))\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . 1 . . .

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,1). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (0,1), which is one unit above the bottom-left corner. There's an apple at (1,0), which is directly to my right and down one step. Another apple is at (1,2), which is right above (1,0). There are other apples farther away.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,2). But I have to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (4,0), and I don't want to run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (0,2). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully, considering both the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (0,2), which is in row 2, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,0): row 0, column 5\n\nOkay, so the closest apples are (1,2) and (1,0), both just one step away from my current position.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (1,2). To get there, I can move right to (1,2), eat it, and then perhaps move up to higher rows where there are more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to (1,0), eat that apple, and then maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (5,0). It's quite a distance away, but I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apple at (1,2) first, as it's directly adjacent, and then move up towards the higher-row apples.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is also just one move down. Maybe I should consider which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (1,2): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move up to (1,3), etc., towards higher-row apples.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move down to (1,0): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move right or left from there.\n\nBut wait, (1,0) is at row 0, which is the bottom row. Moving down from there would be impossible since it's the edge of the board.\n\nSo, after eating (1,0), I'd have to move up to (1,1), then maybe to (1,2) to eat another apple.\n\nBut (1,2) is also accessible directly from my current position.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating both apples in this area before moving on.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n- Move right to (1,2), eat apple\n\n- Then move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eat apple\n\n- Now, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown.\n\n- Then, maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, when I move down from (1,2) to (1,1), then to (1,0), I need to ensure that my snake hasn't grown in such a way that the tail is in my path.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one segment at (0,2). After eating the first apple at (1,2), it will grow, so maybe I need to consider where my tail will be.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake will have an additional segment, but I need to see where that segment is.\n\nAssuming that the tail remains stationary until the next move, when I move to (1,2), my tail stays at (0,2), and then after moving, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward with each move, and when you eat an apple, the tail stays in place instead of moving back.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

Maybe the enemy snake has moved since the board was printed.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll proceed with the positions as given in the description.\n\nSo, my position is (0,3), apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), (8,6), and enemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to find a path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet's consider the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,2): |0-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (1,0): |0-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (3,8): |0-3| + |3-8| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (4,9): |0-4| + |3-9| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (8,6): |0-8| + |3-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2) with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for that one first.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of other snakes and potential paths.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1). I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the sequence in which I can eat multiple apples.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board.\n\nRows 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9.\n\nMy snake is at (0,3).\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (3,8)\n\n- (4,9)\n\n- (8,6)\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat apples in a sequence that maximizes the number I can eat.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating the apples in order of increasing distance, but also considering the positions of other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider which apples are clustered together and go for those first.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (1,2) and (1,0) are relatively close to each other.\n\n- (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6) are farther away and more spread out.\n\nMaybe I should go for the cluster of apples at (1,2) and (1,0) first, since they are closer and close to each other.\n\nFrom my current position at (0,3), I can move right to (1,3), then up to (1,2) to eat the first apple.\n\nThen, from (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then to (1,0) to eat the second apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, I can consider moving to the other apples.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1). I need to keep an eye on its position and avoid it.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move immediately, I can plan my path accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move every turn, so I need to anticipate their movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nTherefore, I should try to minimize the time I'm on the board, eating as many apples as possible before the enemy snake can interfere.\n\nGiven that, going for the closest apples first makes sense.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move right to (1,3)\n\n- Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n- Move down to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating these two apples, I can consider moving to the next cluster.\n\nBut before that, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way or if the enemy snake might have moved into my path.\n\nAlso, after eating the first apple at (1,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't immediately cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a body length of 1 after eating the first apple, I need to ensure that the next moves don't lead me back to the starting position or into my own tail.\n\nMoreover, I need to consider that the enemy snake might be moving"

Down to (1,1)\n\n  - Down to (1,0)\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there immediately after growing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (1,0) first.\n\nLet's consider going for (1,0) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n\n- After eating (1,0), my snake grows, so (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to go for (1,2):\n\n- From (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,1) -> but that's now part of my body, so I can't go there.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple after the first one.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples in a way that allows me to extend my path without blocking myself.\n\nLooking at the positions, the apples at (1,2) and (1,0) are in the same column, which might cause blocking if I'm not careful.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for the apple at (3,8), which is farther but might offer a clearer path if I can navigate around the enemy snake.\n\nBut that seems risky, given the distance and the presence of the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to eat both apples in the same column first, but I need to plan the order carefully.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions again.\n\nMy current position: (0,1)\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,4): row 4, column 6.\n\nI need to consider the movements step by step.\n\nFirst, to reach (1,2):\n\n- Move right to (1,1)\n\n- Move up to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my snake grows, so (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to reach (1,0):\n\n- Move down from (1,2) to (1,1) -> but (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there.\n\nSo, that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (1,0) first:\n\n- Move right to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0)\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake grows, and (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to reach (1,2):\n\n- Move up from (1,0) to (1,1) -> but (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there.\n\nAgain, a dead end.\n\nSo, it seems that eating either of these apples first blocks the path to the other.\n\nTherefore, I need to choose which apple to eat first based on the potential to reach other apples afterward.\n\nLet me consider eating (1,2) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)\n\n- After eating (1,2), my body is now at (1,1)\n\n- From (1,2), I can move right or up, but up is against the wall, so only right to (2,2)\n\n- From (2,2), I can continue right or down, but there are no apples nearby, and the enemy snake might be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, eating (1,0) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n\n- After eating (1,0), my body is now at (1,1)\n\n- From (1,0), I can move left or down, but left is against the wall, so only down to (1,-1), which is off the board.\n\nWait, row 0 is the bottom row, so moving down from (1,0) would be off the board.\n\nSo, that's invalid.\n\nTherefore, eating (1,0) first blocks me from moving further.\n\nSimilarly, eating (1,2) first blocks me from reaching (1,0).\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider not eating both of these apples in sequence.\n\nMaybe I should eat one and then look for a different apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nThese are all fairly distant, and the enemy snake is at (6,4), which might be moving towards me.\n\nI need to make a decision quickly to maximize my score.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to eat the closest apple, which is either (1,2) or (1,0), and then assess the situation.\n\nGiven that, I'll go for (1,2) first.\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (1,1)\n\n2. Move up to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body is now at (1,1)\n\nFrom (1,2), I can:\n\n- Move right to (2,2)\n\n- Move up to (1,3)\n\n- Move down to (1,1), but that's"

Wait, in the board state, it shows my snake at (0,1), but in the description, it says (0,0). There might be a confusion here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nBoard state:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

Let's correct that.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n- To (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n- To (1,2):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n  - Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Right to (1,2)\n\nBut actually, from (1,0), moving right to (1,1), then right to (1,2) would work, but I need to make sure that after eating (1,2), I don't block my path to other apples.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my snake would grow, so the tail would stay, and I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (1,0) first since it's closer.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Eat (1,0)\n\n   - Move up to (1,0)\n\n   - Eat the apple, snake grows\n\n2. Then go for (1,2)\n\n   - From (1,0), move right to (1,1)\n\n   - Move right to (1,2)\n\n   - Eat the apple, snake grows\n\nBut after eating (1,2), my snake would occupy (1,1), so I can't go back to (1,1).\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your body extends, so the tail stays, and the head moves forward.\n\nIn this case, after eating (1,2), my snake would have more segments, and I need to ensure I don't run into them.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe I should consider going for the closer apples first and then see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (1,0) and then look for another apple that doesn't require passing through blocked paths.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) and then go for (3,8), skipping (1,2) for now.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n- To (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n- Then to (3,8):\n\n  - Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Right to (1,2)\n\n  - ...\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Let me think about the positions again.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) first, then go for (3,8).\n\nBut (3,8) is quite far, and there are other apples closer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (1,2), then (3,8), but that seems even more distant.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) first, then look for another apple.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can then decide whether to go for (1,2) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, going from (1,0) to (1,2) might block my path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider moving up to row 1 and then look for a path to multiple apples.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nMy snake is at (0,0). Apples are at (1,0), (1,2), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). The enemy snake is at (6,5).\n\nI need to prioritize eating apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not blocking my own path.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to eat the closest apple first, which is (1,0), and then assess the situation.\n\nSo, first move up to (1,0), eat the apple, and then decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can consider moving right to (1,1), then to (1,2) to eat the next apple.\n\nBut as I thought before, this might block my path.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,0), I can move up to (2,0), and look for other apples.\n\nBut there are no apples in that direction.\n\nWait, let's look at the board again.\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . (apple at (4,9))\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . . (apple at (3,8))\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A . (apple at (8,6))\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . 1 . . . (enemy snake at (6,5))\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . . (apple at (1,2))\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: 2 A . . . . . . . . (snake at (0,0), apple at (1,0))\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, the apples are spread out. The closest ones are (1,0) and (1,2).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first.\n\nIf I go for (1,0):\n\n- Move up to (1,0)\n\n- Eat the apple, snake grows\n\n- Then, to go for (1,2):\n\n  - Move right to (1,1)\n\n  - Move right to (1,2)\n\n  - Eat the apple\n\nBut after eating (1,2), my snake would occupy (1,1), so I can't go back there immediately.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,0), I could move up to (2,0), but there's no apple there, and it might not be beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (1,2) first.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n- Move up to (1,0)\n\n- Move right to (1,1)\n\n- Move right to (1,2)\n\n- Eat the apple\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my snake would occupy (1,1), so I can't go back there immediately.\n\nThen, I could move up to"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to maximize my points by eating apples without dying. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (0,1). Wait, in the board state, it shows my snake at (0,1), but in the description, it says (0,0). There might be a confusion here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nBoard state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . .

A . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (1,0), which is row 1, column 0.\n\nWait, but in the description, it says the snake is at (0,1). Maybe it's a mix-up between rows and columns. Let's clarify: in the board state, rows are from 0 to 9, with row 0 at the bottom. Columns are from 0 to 9, with column 0 on the left.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0: that's where my snake is.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,6): row 6, column 6.\n\nAlright, so I need to plan a path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,0) to each apple:\n\n- (1,2): |1-1| + |0-2| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- (1,0): |1-1| + |0-0| = 0 + 0 = 0 (wait, that's my current position)\n\n- (3,8): |1-3| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (4,9): |1-4| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (8,6): |1-8| + |0-6| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, I'm already at (1,0), which has an apple. I need to move to another apple.\n\nWait, but according to the board state, there's an apple at (1,0), but that's where my snake is. Is that possible? Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nLooking back, in the board state, row 1, column 0 has '2', which is my snake, and row 0, column 1 has 'A', which is an apple at (1,0).\n\nWait, rows and columns might be confusing here. Let's re-examine the board state.\n\nRows are listed from 9 to 0, with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom. Columns are 0 to 9 from left to right.\n\nSo, row 1, column 0 is the second row from the bottom, first column from the left.\n\nGiven that, and my snake is at (1,0), which is row 1, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\nWait, row 0, column 1 is the bottom row, second column from the left.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the coordinates.\n\nIn the board state:\n\n- Rows decrease from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom.\n\n- Columns increase from left to right.\n\nSo, my snake at (1,0) is row 1, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,6): row 6, column 6.\n\nAlright, so from my position at (1,0), I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the distances:\n\n- (1,2): |1-1| + |0-2| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- (1,0): |1-1| + |0-0| = 0 + 0 = 0 (current position)\n\n- (3,8): |1-3| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (4,9): |1-4| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (8,6): |1-8| + |0-6| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 2.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (1,0), which is actually at row 0, column 1, which is position (0,1).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with the coordinates.\n\nLet me plot the positions on a grid to visualize better.\n\nLet's draw the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . .

A . . . . .\n\n...\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: 2 A . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, '2' is at row 0, column 0, and 'A' is at row 0, column 1.\n\nTherefore, my snake is at (0,0), and there's an apple at (0,1).\n\nGot it.\n\nSo, positions:\n\n- My snake: (0,0)\n\n- Apples: (0,1), (2,1), (8,3), (9,4), (6,8)\n\n- Enemy snake: (6,5)\n\nAlright, now I need to plan my moves.\n\nFirst, the closest apples are (0,1), which is adjacent to my current position, and (2,1), which is two steps up and one to the right.\n\nSo, I can either go right to (0,1) to eat the apple there, or up to (1,0), but there's nothing there.\n\nWait, (0,1) is adjacent to my current position.\n\nSo, first move: right to (0,1), eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path that doesn't immediately block myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,1), my snake will be at (0,1), and the tail will be at (0,0).\n\nNext, I can consider moving up to (1,1), then to (2,1) to eat another apple.\n\nBut let's see what's around.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: 2 A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: .

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,1). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (0,1), which is one unit above the bottom-left corner. There's an apple at (1,0), which is directly to my right and down one step. Another apple is at (1,2), which is right above (1,0). There are other apples farther away.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,2). But I have to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (4,0), and I don't want to run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). Enemy snake 1 is at (4,0).\n\nI need to decide my first move. Since I'm at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) seems like a good start because there are apples to the right. But wait, there's an apple directly below at (1,0), and one at (1,2) above.\n\nHmm. If I move down to (1,0), I can eat that apple, but then I'd be next to the apple at (1,2). But moving up from there would be towards (1,2).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the enemy snake. If I move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and then to (1,2), I can eat both apples. But I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (4,0), it's quite a few steps away. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (1,2) first. From (0,1), I can move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2).\n\nBut wait, at (0,2), I need to check if there are any obstacles. Looking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking that path.\n\nSo, option 1: go down to (1,0), eat the apple, then move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nOption 2: move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nOption 1 seems longer, but it allows me to eat two apples in sequence. Option 2 is shorter and quicker to eat one apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If I go for option 1, by the time I reach (1,2), the enemy snake might have moved closer.\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy snake's direction or intelligence level. For now, I'll assume it's trying to eat apples too, but since it's slower or something, I'll proceed with option 2.\n\nSo, first, move up to (0,2), then right to (1,2), eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, at (1,2), there's an apple, and below it at (1,1) and (1,0), there are open spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple, then up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nThis way, I can eat two apples in a row, growing longer and gaining two points.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,8), that's quite a distance away. I'd have to navigate up and to the right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,9) is even higher up.\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is way over to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick with the closer apples first.\n\nAlso, considering that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (0,1), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nWait, but as I eat apples, my snake will grow, so I need to plan paths that account for my growing length.\n\nOkay, perhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (1,0) first, since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nAt that point, my snake will have grown, and I can continue to (1,1), then (1,2), eat that apple as well.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving from (1,0) to (1,1) is safe.\n\nWait, at (1,0), after eating the apple, my snake will extend, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own tail.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one block, so moving from (1,0) to (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen, from (1,1), up to (1,2), eat the apple there.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just go directly to (1,2) and eat that apple first, then come back for (1,0).\n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,0), it might be trying to move upwards to eat apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach (1,2) before the enemy snake can get there.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (4,0), which is quite a few steps away from (1,2).\n\nAssuming both snakes move optimally, I should be able to reach (1,2) first.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in terms of moves.\n\nFrom my position (0,1) to (1,0):\n\nMove down to (1,1), then left to (1,0): 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,2):\n\nUp to (0,2), then right to (1,2): 2 moves.\n\nSo, both paths take the same number of moves.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should choose the path that puts me in a better position to reach other apples afterward.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eating that apple.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eating that apple.\n\nBut in the first scenario, after eating (1,0) and (1,2), I can look to move upwards towards higher-row apples.\n\nIn the second scenario, after eating (1,2) and (1,0), I can move right or left from there.\n\nMaybe the first option is better, as it allows me to move upwards towards more apples.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (4,0), moving upwards would distance me from it, which might be safer.\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to block the enemy snake's path to certain apples.\n\nBut right now, with my limited length, it might be difficult to do that effectively.\n\nI think my best bet is to focus on eating as many apples as I can, starting with the closest ones.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan to go to (1,0) first, then (1,2).\n\nFrom (0,1), I'll move down to (1,1), then left to (1,0), eat the apple.\n\nThen, move up to (1,1), then up to (1,2), eat that apple.\n\nAt this point, I would have eaten two apples, gaining two points.\n\nMy snake would have grown by two segments."

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (0,2). There are apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully, considering both the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . .

A . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (0,2), which is in row 2, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,0): row 0, column 5\n\nOkay, so the closest apples are (1,2) and (1,0), both just one step away from my current position.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (1,2). To get there, I can move right to (1,2), eat it, and then perhaps move up to higher rows where there are more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could go down to (1,0), eat that apple, and then maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (5,0). It's quite a distance away, but I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the apple at (1,2) first, as it's directly adjacent, and then move up towards the higher-row apples.\n\nWait, but (1,0) is also just one move down. Maybe I should consider which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (1,2): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move up to (1,3), etc., towards higher-row apples.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move down to (1,0): eat apple, grow, score +1\n\n- Then move right or left from there.\n\nBut wait, (1,0) is at row 0, which is the bottom row. Moving down from there would be impossible since it's the edge of the board.\n\nSo, after eating (1,0), I'd have to move up to (1,1), then maybe to (1,2) to eat another apple.\n\nBut (1,2) is also accessible directly from my current position.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating both apples in this area before moving on.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n- Move right to (1,2), eat apple\n\n- Then move down to (1,1), then down to (1,0), eat apple\n\n- Now, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown.\n\n- Then, maybe move right or left from there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, when I move down from (1,2) to (1,1), then to (1,0), I need to ensure that my snake hasn't grown in such a way that the tail is in my path.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just one segment at (0,2). After eating the first apple at (1,2), it will grow, so maybe I need to consider where my tail will be.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake will have an additional segment, but I need to see where that segment is.\n\nAssuming that the tail remains stationary until the next move, when I move to (1,2), my tail stays at (0,2), and then after moving, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward with each move, and when you eat an apple, the tail stays in place instead of moving back.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows, each segment taking the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, effectively making the snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (0,2), and I move right to (1,2), eating the apple there, then my tail remains at (0,2), and the rest of the body moves forward.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move to (1,1), my tail still remains at (0,2), and the body segment moves to (1,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into my own tail or any part of my body.\n\nBut right now, with only one body segment, I just need to ensure I don't move back onto my tail.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), moving to (1,1) should be safe, as my tail is at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,0), eating the apple, my tail remains at (0,2), and the body is at (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,1), my tail moves from (0,2) to (1,2), and the body moves from (1,2) to (1,1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning an additional segment is added to the tail.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has two segments: head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2).\n\nThen, moving to (1,1), the tail moves to (0,2), and the body moves to (1,2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, each move, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, the tail does not move on that move, effectively adding a new segment.\n\nSo, initial position:\n\n- Head: (0,2)\n\n- No body.\n\nEat apple at (1,2):\n\n- Head moves to (1,2)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nNext move to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail moves to (1,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (1,2)\n\nWait, but in some Snake versions, eating an apple makes the tail stay in place, and the body segments move as usual.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up how Snake's body movement works exactly when eating apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that after eating an apple, the tail stays in place, and the snake has an additional segment.\n\nSo, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,1) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,0):\n\n- Head moves to (1,0)\n\n- Tail remains at (0,2)\n\n- Now, snake has head at (1,0) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to confirm this to make sure I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to assume that after eating an apple, the tail doesn't move on that move, and then subsequent moves have the tail moving as usual.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the idea that after eating an apple, the tail remains in place, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nTherefore, after eating (1,2), my snake has head at (1,2) and tail at (0,2)\n\nThen, moving to (1,1):\n\n- Head moves to (1,1)\n\n- Tail remains at"

The apples are at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,0), which is in row 6, column 0.\n\nWait, in the board, row 0, column 4 has '1', which seems to be the enemy snake.\n\nBut according to the positions, the enemy snake is at (6,0). There might be a mistake in the board or the positions.\n\nLet me assume that positions are (row, column), so my position is (3,0), and the enemy is at (6,0).\n\nLooking back at the board, row 6, column 0 is empty, but row 0, column 4 has '1'. Maybe the enemy snake has a body part or something.\n\nBut in the description, it says the enemy snake is at (6,1) with body at []. Wait, in the initial description, it says:\n\nEnemy snakes positions:\n\n- Snake #1 is at position (6,1) with body at []\n\nBut in the board, row 6, column 1 is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between (x,y) and (row,column). Let's assume positions are (column, row).\n\nSo, my position is (0,3), which is column 0, row 3.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (1,0): column 1, row 0\n\n- (3,8): column 3, row 8\n\n- (4,9): column 4, row 9\n\n- (8,6): column 8, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,1): column 6, row 1.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

Maybe the enemy snake has moved since the board was printed.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll proceed with the positions as given in the description.\n\nSo, my position is (0,3), apples at (1,2), (1,0), (3,8), (4,9), (8,6), and enemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to find a path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet's consider the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,2): |0-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (1,0): |0-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (3,8): |0-3| + |3-8| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (4,9): |0-4| + |3-9| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (8,6): |0-8| + |3-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,2) with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, maybe I should go for that one first.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of other snakes and potential paths.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1). I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the sequence in which I can eat multiple apples.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board.\n\nRows 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9.\n\nMy snake is at (0,3).\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (3,8)\n\n- (4,9)\n\n- (8,6)\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat apples in a sequence that maximizes the number I can eat.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating the apples in order of increasing distance, but also considering the positions of other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider which apples are clustered together and go for those first.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (1,2) and (1,0) are relatively close to each other.\n\n- (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6) are farther away and more spread out.\n\nMaybe I should go for the cluster of apples at (1,2) and (1,0) first, since they are closer and close to each other.\n\nFrom my current position at (0,3), I can move right to (1,3), then up to (1,2) to eat the first apple.\n\nThen, from (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), then to (1,0) to eat the second apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating those two, I can consider moving to the other apples.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,1), which is at (6,1). I need to keep an eye on its position and avoid it.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move immediately, I can plan my path accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move every turn, so I need to anticipate their movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nTherefore, I should try to minimize the time I'm on the board, eating as many apples as possible before the enemy snake can interfere.\n\nGiven that, going for the closest apples first makes sense.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Move right to (1,3)\n\n- Move up to (1,2) to eat the apple\n\n- Move down to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating these two apples, I can consider moving to the next cluster.\n\nBut before that, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way or if the"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (0,1). Wait, in the board state, it shows my snake at (0,1), but in the description, it says (0,1). Okay, that's consistent.\n\nLet me look at the board again to make sure I understand the positions.\n\nBoard state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . .

Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Up to (1,2)\n\n- To (1,0):\n\n  - Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Down to (1,0)\n\nBoth paths involve moving right to (1,1) first.\n\nAfter eating one apple, I need to decide which one to go for next.\n\nAssuming I eat (1,2) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)\n\n- After eating (1,2), my snake grows, so I need to make sure the next move doesn't lead me back to (1,1), which is now part of my body.\n\nThen, to go for (1,0):\n\n- From (1,2):\n\n  - Down to (1,1)\n\n  - Down to (1,0)\n\nBut wait, (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there immediately after growing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (1,0) first.\n\nLet's consider going for (1,0) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n\n- After eating (1,0), my snake grows, so (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to go for (1,2):\n\n- From (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,1) -> but that's now part of my body, so I can't go there.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple after the first one.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples in a way that allows me to extend my path without blocking myself.\n\nLooking at the positions, the apples at (1,2) and (1,0) are in the same column, which might cause blocking if I'm not careful.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for the apple at (3,8), which is farther but might offer a clearer path if I can navigate around the enemy snake.\n\nBut that seems risky, given the distance and the presence of the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to eat both apples in the same column first, but I need to plan the order carefully.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions again.\n\nMy current position: (0,1)\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,4): row 4, column 6.\n\nI need to consider the movements step by step.\n\nFirst, to reach (1,2):\n\n- Move right to (1,1)\n\n- Move up to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my snake grows, so (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to reach (1,0):\n\n- Move down from (1,2) to (1,1) -> but (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there.\n\nSo, that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (1,0) first:\n\n- Move right to (1,1)\n\n- Move down to (1,0)\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake grows, and (1,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, to reach (1,2):\n\n- Move up from (1,0) to (1,1) -> but (1,1) is now part of my body, so I can't move there.\n\nAgain, a dead end.\n\nSo, it seems that eating either of these apples first blocks the path to the other.\n\nTherefore, I need to choose which apple to eat first based on the potential to reach other apples afterward.\n\nLet me consider eating (1,2) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)\n\n- After eating (1,2), my body is now at (1,1)\n\n- From (1,2), I can move right or up, but up is against the wall, so only right to (2,2)\n\n- From (2,2), I can continue right or down, but there are no apples nearby, and the enemy snake might be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, eating (1,0) first:\n\n- Path: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n\n- After eating (1,0), my body is now at (1,1)\n\n- From (1,0), I can move left or down, but left is against the wall, so only down to (1,-1), which is off the board.\n\nWait, row 0 is the bottom row, so moving down from (1,0) would be off the board.\n\nSo, that's invalid.\n\nTherefore, eating (1,0) first blocks me from moving further.\n\nSimilarly, eating (1,2) first blocks me from reaching (1,0).\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider not eating both of these apples in sequence.\n\nMaybe I should eat one and then look for a different apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nThese are all fairly distant, and the enemy snake is at (6,4), which might be moving towards me.\n\nI need to make a decision quickly to maximize my score.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to eat the closest apple, which is either (1,2) or (1,0), and then assess the situation.\n\nGiven that, I'll go for (1,2) first.\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (1,1)\n\n2. Move up to (1,2)\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my body is now at (1,1)\n\nFrom (1,2), I can:\n\n- Move right to (2,2)\n\n- Move up to (1,3)\n\n- Move down to (1,1), but that's"

Let's correct that.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n- To (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n- To (1,2):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n  - Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Right to (1,2)\n\nBut actually, from (1,0), moving right to (1,1), then right to (1,2) would work, but I need to make sure that after eating (1,2), I don't block my path to other apples.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my snake would grow, so the tail would stay, and I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (1,0) first since it's closer.\n\nLet's consider the sequence:\n\n1. Eat (1,0)\n\n   - Move up to (1,0)\n\n   - Eat the apple, snake grows\n\n2. Then go for (1,2)\n\n   - From (1,0), move right to (1,1)\n\n   - Move right to (1,2)\n\n   - Eat the apple, snake grows\n\nBut after eating (1,2), my snake would occupy (1,1), so I can't go back to (1,1).\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your body extends, so the tail stays, and the head moves forward.\n\nIn this case, after eating (1,2), my snake would have more segments, and I need to ensure I don't run into them.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe I should consider going for the closer apples first and then see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (1,0) and then look for another apple that doesn't require passing through blocked paths.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) and then go for (3,8), skipping (1,2) for now.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n- To (1,0):\n\n  - Up to (1,0)\n\n- Then to (3,8):\n\n  - Right to (1,1)\n\n  - Right to (1,2)\n\n  - ...\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Let me think about the positions again.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) first, then go for (3,8).\n\nBut (3,8) is quite far, and there are other apples closer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (1,2), then (3,8), but that seems even more distant.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (1,0) first, then look for another apple.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can then decide whether to go for (1,2) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, going from (1,0) to (1,2) might block my path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider moving up to row 1 and then look for a path to multiple apples.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nMy snake is at (0,0). Apples are at (1,0), (1,2), (3,8), (4,9), and (8,6). The enemy snake is at (6,5).\n\nI need to prioritize eating apples while avoiding the enemy snake and not blocking my own path.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to eat the closest apple first, which is (1,0), and then assess the situation.\n\nSo, first move up to (1,0), eat the apple, and then decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can consider moving right to (1,1), then to (1,2) to eat the next apple.\n\nBut as I thought before, this might block my path.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,0), I can move up to (2,0), and look for other apples.\n\nBut there are no apples in that direction.\n\nWait, let's look at the board again.\n\nRow 9: . . . .

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (0,1). Wait, in the board state, it shows my snake at (0,1), but in the description, it says (0,0). There might be a confusion here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nBoard state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . .

Maybe it's a mix-up between rows and columns. Let's clarify: in the board state, rows are from 0 to 9, with row 0 at the bottom. Columns are from 0 to 9, with column 0 on the left.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0: that's where my snake is.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,6): row 6, column 6.\n\nAlright, so I need to plan a path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,0) to each apple:\n\n- (1,2): |1-1| + |0-2| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- (1,0): |1-1| + |0-0| = 0 + 0 = 0 (wait, that's my current position)\n\n- (3,8): |1-3| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (4,9): |1-4| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (8,6): |1-8| + |0-6| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, I'm already at (1,0), which has an apple. I need to move to another apple.\n\nWait, but according to the board state, there's an apple at (1,0), but that's where my snake is. Is that possible? Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nLooking back, in the board state, row 1, column 0 has '2', which is my snake, and row 0, column 1 has 'A', which is an apple at (1,0).\n\nWait, rows and columns might be confusing here. Let's re-examine the board state.\n\nRows are listed from 9 to 0, with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom. Columns are 0 to 9 from left to right.\n\nSo, row 1, column 0 is the second row from the bottom, first column from the left.\n\nGiven that, and my snake is at (1,0), which is row 1, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\nWait, row 0, column 1 is the bottom row, second column from the left.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the coordinates.\n\nIn the board state:\n\n- Rows decrease from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom.\n\n- Columns increase from left to right.\n\nSo, my snake at (1,0) is row 1, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (1,0): row 0, column 1\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (4,9): row 9, column 4\n\n- (8,6): row 6, column 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,6): row 6, column 6.\n\nAlright, so from my position at (1,0), I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the distances:\n\n- (1,2): |1-1| + |0-2| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- (1,0): |1-1| + |0-0| = 0 + 0 = 0 (current position)\n\n- (3,8): |1-3| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (4,9): |1-4| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (8,6): |1-8| + |0-6| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2), distance 2.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (1,0), which is actually at row 0, column 1, which is position (0,1).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with the coordinates.\n\nLet me plot the positions on a grid to visualize better.\n\nLet's draw the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . .
