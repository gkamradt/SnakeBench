Review of Current Position: With the last reported position being (1, 2) and movement DOWN, there might be an error in tracking as moving DOWN from (1, 2) actually positions the snake at (1, 1) rather than (1, 3). Correcting this, I am currently at (1, 1) aiming to move towards the apple at (2, 2).\n\n2. Strategic Adjustment: Since I'm now at (1, 1) moving directly up to target the apple at (2, 2) seems slightly rerouted. To efficiently collect it, a move to the RIGHT to (2, 1) followed by UP to (2, 2) appears necessary.\n\n3. Enemy Awareness: Snake #2 remains distanced at (9, 2), implying limited immediate conflict or interference in my path to (2, 2). Their positioning closer to the right wall suggests their potential action area might shift towards the apples at the right side of the board.\n\n4. Future Prospects: After grabbing the apple at (2, 2), planning should pivot towards the next closest apple, potentially the one at (4, 3). This could be approached by moving RIGHT further or adjusting trajectory based on real-time board dynamics.\n\n**Strategic Considerations for Upcoming Moves:**\nAfter securing the apple at (2, 2), analyzing the necessity to maneuver to (4, 3) should be reassessed, given other snakes' positions, available paths, and apple regeneration locations.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"
