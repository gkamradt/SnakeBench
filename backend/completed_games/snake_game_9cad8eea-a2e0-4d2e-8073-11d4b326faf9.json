After collecting an apple, assess if moving towards the next apple or repositioning away from potential threats is warranted.\n- Maintaining flexibility in positioning will be key, especially with the proximity of an enemy snake.\n\nIn conclusion, I will move **DOWN** to (9, 1) to collect the apple.\n\nDecided next move: **DOWN.**"
