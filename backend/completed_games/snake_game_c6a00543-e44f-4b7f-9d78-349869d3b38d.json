There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2). Oh, wait, one of the apples is at (4,2), which is directly above me at (8,2). Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . A . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . A .

There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings of my snake head at (8,2).\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\nPosition (0,2): .\n\nPosition (1,2): .\n\nPosition (2,2): .\n\nPosition (3,2): .\n\nPosition (4,2): A (apple)\n\nPosition (5,2): .\n\nPosition (6,2): A (apple)\n\nPosition (7,2): .\n\nPosition (8,2): 2 (my head)\n\nPosition (9,2): .\n\nLooking at column 2:\n\nRow 0: .\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 2: 2\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 7: .\n\nRow 8: .\n\nRow 9: .\n\nSo, directly above me at (8,3), (8,4), etc., there's nothing until (8,9).\n\nTo the right, at (9,2), it's empty.\n\nTo the left, at (7,2), it's empty.\n\nDown, at (8,1), it's empty.\n\nSo, I can move up, down, left, or right without immediately hitting a wall or another snake.\n\nBut I need to think about longer-term consequences.\n\nFirst, there's an apple at (4,2), which is to the left of me, and another at (6,2), which is to the right.\n\nIf I move left to (7,2), I would be closer to the apple at (4,2), but there's also an apple at (6,2), which is closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (9,2) would take me away from both apples.\n\nWait, no, (6,2) is at (6,2), and I'm at (8,2), so moving left towards (6,2).\n\nWait, in terms of X coordinates, higher X is right, lower X is left.\n\nSo, to get to (6,2) from (8,2), I need to move left.\n\nTo get to (4,2), I need to keep moving left past (6,2).\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (4,2) and (6,2).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nSimilarly, there are apples at (4,8) and (7,8), which are up and to the right.\n\nSnake 1 is at (1,7), but its body is empty, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nBut it's quite far away, at (1,7), and I'm at (8,2), so for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nFirst, let's think about the apples.\n\nIf I move left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple there, then continue left to (5,2), (4,2) to eat that apple, then maybe move up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get blocked by my own body or by snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim directly for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8) by moving up first.\n\nBut that would require me to move up to (8,3), (8,4), etc., and then left or right as needed.\n\nBut I need to consider the distance.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple.\n\nManhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.\n\nFrom (8,2) to (4,8): |8-4| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTo (6,2): |8-6| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nTo (7,8): |8-7| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,1): |8-3| + |2-1| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nTo (4,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), distance 2.\n\nThen (4,2), distance 4.\n\nThen (3,1), distance 5.\n\nThen (7,8), distance 7.\n\nThen (4,8), distance 10.\n\nSo, logically, I should go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nTo get from (8,2) to (6,2), I need to move left twice.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move is safe.\n\nAssuming I move left to (7,2), then left again to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I could aim for (4,2), which is further left.\n\nOr I could consider moving up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up would require me to navigate around the board, potentially encountering snake 1 or my own body.\n\nWait, after eating (6,2), my body would extend, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a body, but since it's not specified, I'll assume my body is just the head for now.\n\nWait, in snake games, typically, the snake has a body that follows the head.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked.\n\nWait, in the board state, '2' is at (8,2), and there are no other '2's, so maybe my body is just the head right now.\n\nOr perhaps the body is not shown in the board state.\n\nThe enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body at [], which might mean it has no body parts besides the head.\n\nGiven that, perhaps my snake also has no body parts besides the head.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, eating an apple increases your length.\n\nBut since this is a multi-apple scenario, perhaps there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one allows you to grow.\n\nBut I need to confirm the rules.\n\nRule 1: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nRule 2: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nRule 3: The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nAssuming that my snake has a body that follows the head, but since it's not shown on the board, perhaps it's just the head for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2' at (8,2) indicates the head and the rest of the body is not visible because it's not on the board.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll assume that my snake has no body besides the head for now.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so the previous position of the head becomes the new tail.\n\nBut since I just moved from (8,2) to (7,2) to (6,2), my tail would be at (7,2).\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,2), my snake has two segments: head at (6,2) and tail at (7,2).\n\nThen, for the next move, I need"

After eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,2).\n\nThen, if I continue moving left to (5,2), I need to make sure that the spot is clear and that I don't run into anything.\n\nSimilarly, I could consider moving up from (6,2) towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut that might be a longer path, and I need to make sure I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (4,2), which is further left, but (6,2) is closer.\n\nWait, (6,2) is at (6,2), and I'm at (7,2). So, moving left once to (6,2) to eat it.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can move up towards (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up from (6,2) to (6,3), then (6,4), and so on, would take me closer to (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7) and has no body, it's probably moving around as well, but for now, it's not in my immediate path.\n\nAnother consideration is that there's an apple at (4,2), which is at (4,2), and I'm at (7,2). So, to get to (4,2), I need to move left three times from (7,2) to (4,2).\n\nBut if I do that, I might be leaving myself open to snake 1, or perhaps there are better apples to go for.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (3,1), which is at (3,1), so that's down and left from my current position.\n\nBut the apple at (6,2) is right next to me, so it's hard to ignore.\n\nLet me think about the distances again.\n\nUsing Manhattan distance:\n\nFrom (7,2):\n\n- To (6,2): 1\n\n- To (4,2): 3\n\n- To (7,8): 6\n\n- To (4,8): 5\n\n- To (3,1): 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), followed by (4,2), then (3,1), then (4,8), and finally (7,8).\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can then decide whether to go for (4,2), (3,1), or go upwards towards (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nI need to consider the positions of snake 1 and plan my path accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to keep in mind that after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without running into my own tail.\n\nGiven that, moving left to (6,2) seems like a safe move for now.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can consider moving left again to (5,2), then (4,2) to eat that apple, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up from (6,2) towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's plan a path:\n\n1.

Then, maybe move up to (4,3), (4,4), etc., towards (4,8)\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (4,8) without running into snake 1 or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), etc., but that might not be the most efficient path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (3,1) after (4,2).\n\nBut that might take me further away from the other apples.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, towards (4,8).\n\nThat seems like a reasonable path.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7), and I'm at (7,2), it's currently quite far away.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns, but for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best move for now is to move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving left to (5,2), then (4,2), eat that apple, and then decide whether to move up towards (4,8) or go for other apples.\n\nI need to be cautious not to run into my own tail as I grow.\n\nAlso, I should keep an eye on snake 1's movements.\n\nBut for this turn, moving left to (6,2) seems like the optimal move.\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2). Oh, wait, one of the apples is at (4,2), which is directly above me at (8,2). Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . A . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . A .

There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings of my snake head at (8,2).\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\nPosition (0,2): .\n\nPosition (1,2): .\n\nPosition (2,2): .\n\nPosition (3,2): .\n\nPosition (4,2): A (apple)\n\nPosition (5,2): .\n\nPosition (6,2): A (apple)\n\nPosition (7,2): .\n\nPosition (8,2): 2 (my head)\n\nPosition (9,2): .\n\nLooking at column 2:\n\nRow 0: .\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 2: 2\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 7: .\n\nRow 8: .\n\nRow 9: .\n\nSo, directly above me at (8,3), (8,4), etc., there's nothing until (8,9).\n\nTo the right, at (9,2), it's empty.\n\nTo the left, at (7,2), it's empty.\n\nDown, at (8,1), it's empty.\n\nSo, I can move up, down, left, or right without immediately hitting a wall or another snake.\n\nBut I need to think about longer-term consequences.\n\nFirst, there's an apple at (4,2), which is to the left of me, and another at (6,2), which is to the right.\n\nIf I move left to (7,2), I would be closer to the apple at (4,2), but there's also an apple at (6,2), which is closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (9,2) would take me away from both apples.\n\nWait, no, (6,2) is at (6,2), and I'm at (8,2), so moving left towards (6,2).\n\nWait, in terms of X coordinates, higher X is right, lower X is left.\n\nSo, to get to (6,2) from (8,2), I need to move left.\n\nTo get to (4,2), I need to keep moving left past (6,2).\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (4,2) and (6,2).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nSimilarly, there are apples at (4,8) and (7,8), which are up and to the right.\n\nSnake 1 is at (1,7), but its body is empty, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nBut it's quite far away, at (1,7), and I'm at (8,2), so for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nFirst, let's think about the apples.\n\nIf I move left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple there, then continue left to (5,2), (4,2) to eat that apple, then maybe move up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get blocked by my own body or by snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim directly for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8) by moving up first.\n\nBut that would require me to move up to (8,3), (8,4), etc., and then left or right as needed.\n\nBut I need to consider the distance.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple.\n\nManhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.\n\nFrom (8,2) to (4,8): |8-4| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTo (6,2): |8-6| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nTo (7,8): |8-7| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,1): |8-3| + |2-1| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nTo (4,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), distance 2.\n\nThen (4,2), distance 4.\n\nThen (3,1), distance 5.\n\nThen (7,8), distance 7.\n\nThen (4,8), distance 10.\n\nSo, logically, I should go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nTo get from (8,2) to (6,2), I need to move left twice.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move is safe.\n\nAssuming I move left to (7,2), then left again to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I could aim for (4,2), which is further left.\n\nOr I could consider moving up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up would require me to navigate around the board, potentially encountering snake 1 or my own body.\n\nWait, after eating (6,2), my body would extend, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a body, but since it's not specified, I'll assume my body is just the head for now.\n\nWait, in snake games, typically, the snake has a body that follows the head.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked.\n\nWait, in the board state, '2' is at (8,2), and there are no other '2's, so maybe my body is just the head right now.\n\nOr perhaps the body is not shown in the board state.\n\nThe enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body at [], which might mean it has no body parts besides the head.\n\nGiven that, perhaps my snake also has no body parts besides the head.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, eating an apple increases your length.\n\nBut since this is a multi-apple scenario, perhaps there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one allows you to grow.\n\nBut I need to confirm the rules.\n\nRule 1: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nRule 2: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nRule 3: The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nAssuming that my snake has a body that follows the head, but since it's not shown on the board, perhaps it's just the head for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2' at (8,2) indicates the head and the rest of the body is not visible because it's not on the board.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll assume that my snake has no body besides the head for now.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so the previous position of the head becomes the new tail.\n\nBut since I just moved from (8,2) to (7,2) to (6,2), my tail would be at (7,2).\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,2), my snake has two segments: head at (6,2) and tail at (7,2).\n\nThen, for the next move, I need"

Then, maybe move up to (4,3), (4,4), etc., towards (4,8)\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (4,8) without running into snake 1 or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), etc., but that might not be the most efficient path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (3,1) after (4,2).\n\nBut that might take me further away from the other apples.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, towards (4,8).\n\nThat seems like a reasonable path.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7), and I'm at (7,2), it's currently quite far away.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns, but for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best move for now is to move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving left to (5,2), then (4,2), eat that apple, and then decide whether to move up towards (4,8) or go for other apples.\n\nI need to be cautious not to run into my own tail as I grow.\n\nAlso, I should keep an eye on snake 1's movements.\n\nBut for this turn, moving left to (6,2) seems like the optimal move.\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this Snake game. Let's see the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is currently at position (7,2). There are apples at (4,8), (7,8), (3,1), (4,2), and (6,2). So, there are multiple apples to go for.\n\nI need to decide which apple to target first and plan a path to get there without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me look at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots\n\n- Row 8: dots with apples at (4,8) and (7,8)\n\n- Row 7: snake 1 at (1,7), rest dots\n\n- Row 6: all dots\n\n- Row 5: all dots\n\n- Row 4: all dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots with apples at (4,2) and (6,2), and my snake at (7,2)\n\n- Row 1: apple at (3,1), rest dots\n\n- Row 0: all dots\n\nColumns: 0 to 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,2), and there are apples at (6,2), (4,2), (3,1), (4,8), and (7,8).\n\nFirst, I should consider the closest apples to minimize the moves needed to get them.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,2) to each apple:\n\n- (6,2): |7-6| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (4,2): |7-4| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,1): |7-3| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (4,8): |7-4| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- (7,8): |7-7| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), which is right next to me. It makes sense to go for that one first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,2).\n\nThen, I can consider moving left again to (5,2), then to (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nFrom there, I can decide whether to go up towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8), or down towards (3,1).\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, move left to (5,2).\n\nThen, move left to (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples and have a longer snake.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to go up towards (4,8) or go down towards (3,1).\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (4,8) is up at row 8, column 4\n\n- (3,1) is down at row 1, column 3\n\nGiven that, going up to (4,8) would require moving up from (4,2) to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, up to (4,8). That's 6 moves up.\n\nAlternatively, going down to (3,1) would require moving down from (4,2) to (4,1), then left to (3,1) to eat the apple. That's 2 moves.\n\nSo, the apple at (3,1) is closer in terms of moves from (4,2).\n\nBut I also need to consider the position of snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 or its body.\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7) and has no body, it's probably moving around, but for now, it's not in my immediate path.\n\nAssuming snake 1 doesn't interfere, it might be better to go for the closer apple at (3,1) next.\n\nSo, after eating (4,2), move down to (4,1), then left to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can consider moving up towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should consider going for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8) directly after eating (4,2).\n\nWait, let's think about the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, up to (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,3), and so on, but that might not be as efficient.\n\nGiven that, moving up from (4,2) towards (4,8) seems reasonable.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apple at (7,8). Maybe I can find a path that allows me to eat both (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nLet's think about a path:\n\n- From (4,2), move up to (4,3)\n\n- Then to (4,4)\n\n- Then to (4,5)\n\n- Then to (4,6)\n\n- Then to (4,7)\n\n- Then to (4,8) to eat the apple\n\n- Then move right to (5,8)\n\n- Then to (6,8)\n\n- Then to (7,8) to eat the apple\n\nThat seems like a possible path, but it's a long way up.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 or any part of my own body along the way.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as my snake grows, I have to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could consider going for the apple at (3,1), which is closer.\n\nLet me compare the distances:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- To (3,1): |4-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (4,8): |4-4| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, the apple at (3,1) is much closer.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), I can then decide whether to go for (4,8) or (7,8).\n\nBut considering that (4,8) is closer to (3,1) than (7,8), it might be better to go for (4,8) next.\n\nFrom (3,1), to (4,1), then (4,2), then (4,3), and up to (4,8).\n\nThen, from (4,8), I can move right to (5,8), then (6,8), then (7,8) to eat the last apple.\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 along the way.\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7), and assuming it moves randomly, I need to keep an eye on its position in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the closest apples first seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Move left to (5,2).\n\n3. Move left to (4,2) to eat the apple.\n\n4. Move down to (4,1).\n\n5. Move left to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\n6. Move up to (3,2), then (3,3), ..., up to (3,8), then right to (4,8) to eat the apple.\n\n7. Move right to (5,8), then (6,8), then (7,8) to eat the last apple.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, directly to (4,8), then to (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to prioritize eating the closest apples first and then proceed to the farther ones.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that if I go for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8), I might be exposing myself to snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, since it's closer to my current position compared to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (7,2), the distance to (7,8) is |2-8|"

The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . A . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . A .

There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings of my snake head at (8,2).\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\nPosition (0,2): .\n\nPosition (1,2): .\n\nPosition (2,2): .\n\nPosition (3,2): .\n\nPosition (4,2): A (apple)\n\nPosition (5,2): .\n\nPosition (6,2): A (apple)\n\nPosition (7,2): .\n\nPosition (8,2): 2 (my head)\n\nPosition (9,2): .\n\nLooking at column 2:\n\nRow 0: .\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 2: 2\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 7: .\n\nRow 8: .\n\nRow 9: .\n\nSo, directly above me at (8,3), (8,4), etc., there's nothing until (8,9).\n\nTo the right, at (9,2), it's empty.\n\nTo the left, at (7,2), it's empty.\n\nDown, at (8,1), it's empty.\n\nSo, I can move up, down, left, or right without immediately hitting a wall or another snake.\n\nBut I need to think about longer-term consequences.\n\nFirst, there's an apple at (4,2), which is to the left of me, and another at (6,2), which is to the right.\n\nIf I move left to (7,2), I would be closer to the apple at (4,2), but there's also an apple at (6,2), which is closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (9,2) would take me away from both apples.\n\nWait, no, (6,2) is at (6,2), and I'm at (8,2), so moving left towards (6,2).\n\nWait, in terms of X coordinates, higher X is right, lower X is left.\n\nSo, to get to (6,2) from (8,2), I need to move left.\n\nTo get to (4,2), I need to keep moving left past (6,2).\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (4,2) and (6,2).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nSimilarly, there are apples at (4,8) and (7,8), which are up and to the right.\n\nSnake 1 is at (1,7), but its body is empty, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nBut it's quite far away, at (1,7), and I'm at (8,2), so for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nFirst, let's think about the apples.\n\nIf I move left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple there, then continue left to (5,2), (4,2) to eat that apple, then maybe move up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get blocked by my own body or by snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim directly for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8) by moving up first.\n\nBut that would require me to move up to (8,3), (8,4), etc., and then left or right as needed.\n\nBut I need to consider the distance.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple.\n\nManhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.\n\nFrom (8,2) to (4,8): |8-4| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTo (6,2): |8-6| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nTo (7,8): |8-7| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,1): |8-3| + |2-1| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nTo (4,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), distance 2.\n\nThen (4,2), distance 4.\n\nThen (3,1), distance 5.\n\nThen (7,8), distance 7.\n\nThen (4,8), distance 10.\n\nSo, logically, I should go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nTo get from (8,2) to (6,2), I need to move left twice.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move is safe.\n\nAssuming I move left to (7,2), then left again to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I could aim for (4,2), which is further left.\n\nOr I could consider moving up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up would require me to navigate around the board, potentially encountering snake 1 or my own body.\n\nWait, after eating (6,2), my body would extend, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a body, but since it's not specified, I'll assume my body is just the head for now.\n\nWait, in snake games, typically, the snake has a body that follows the head.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked.\n\nWait, in the board state, '2' is at (8,2), and there are no other '2's, so maybe my body is just the head right now.\n\nOr perhaps the body is not shown in the board state.\n\nThe enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body at [], which might mean it has no body parts besides the head.\n\nGiven that, perhaps my snake also has no body parts besides the head.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, eating an apple increases your length.\n\nBut since this is a multi-apple scenario, perhaps there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one allows you to grow.\n\nBut I need to confirm the rules.\n\nRule 1: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nRule 2: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nRule 3: The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nAssuming that my snake has a body that follows the head, but since it's not shown on the board, perhaps it's just the head for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2' at (8,2) indicates the head and the rest of the body is not visible because it's not on the board.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll assume that my snake has no body besides the head for now.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so the previous position of the head becomes the new tail.\n\nBut since I just moved from (8,2) to (7,2) to (6,2), my tail would be at (7,2).\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,2), my snake has two segments: head at (6,2) and tail at (7,2).\n\nThen, for the next move, I need"

Let's check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots with apples at (4,8) and (7,8)\n\nRow 7: snake 1 at (1,7), rest dots\n\nRow 6: all dots\n\nRow 5: all dots\n\nRow 4: all dots\n\nRow 3: all dots\n\nRow 2: dots with apples at (4,2) and (6,2), and my snake at (7,2)\n\nRow 1: apple at (3,1), rest dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nColumns: 0 to 9\n\nSo, my snake is indeed at (7,2), not (8,2). Maybe there was a mistake in the last move information.\n\nAlright, moving on. There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple at (6,2), which is adjacent to me, or plan for longer-term moves to get more apples.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nAt (7,2), I can move:\n\n- Up to (7,3)\n\n- Down to (7,1)\n\n- Left to (6,2) - apple!\n\n- Right to (8,2)\n\nMoving left to (6,2) would let me eat the apple, which is good because I gain a point and grow in length.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,2).\n\nThen, if I continue moving left to (5,2), I need to make sure that the spot is clear and that I don't run into anything.\n\nSimilarly, I could consider moving up from (6,2) towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut that might be a longer path, and I need to make sure I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (4,2), which is further left, but (6,2) is closer.\n\nWait, (6,2) is at (6,2), and I'm at (7,2). So, moving left once to (6,2) to eat it.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can move up towards (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up from (6,2) to (6,3), then (6,4), and so on, would take me closer to (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7) and has no body, it's probably moving around as well, but for now, it's not in my immediate path.\n\nAnother consideration is that there's an apple at (4,2), which is at (4,2), and I'm at (7,2). So, to get to (4,2), I need to move left three times from (7,2) to (4,2).\n\nBut if I do that, I might be leaving myself open to snake 1, or perhaps there are better apples to go for.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (3,1), which is at (3,1), so that's down and left from my current position.\n\nBut the apple at (6,2) is right next to me, so it's hard to ignore.\n\nLet me think about the distances again.\n\nUsing Manhattan distance:\n\nFrom (7,2):\n\n- To (6,2): 1\n\n- To (4,2): 3\n\n- To (7,8): 6\n\n- To (4,8): 5\n\n- To (3,1): 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), followed by (4,2), then (3,1), then (4,8), and finally (7,8).\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can then decide whether to go for (4,2), (3,1), or go upwards towards (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nI need to consider the positions of snake 1 and plan my path accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to keep in mind that after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without running into my own tail.\n\nGiven that, moving left to (6,2) seems like a safe move for now.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can consider moving left again to (5,2), then (4,2) to eat that apple, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up from (6,2) towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's plan a path:\n\n1. Move left to (6,2) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. Move left to (5,2)\n\n3. Move left to (4,2) - eat apple, grow\n\n4. Then, maybe move up to (4,3), (4,4), etc., towards (4,8)\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (4,8) without running into snake 1 or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), etc., but that might not be the most efficient path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (3,1) after (4,2).\n\nBut that might take me further away from the other apples.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, towards (4,8).\n\nThat seems like a reasonable path.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7), and I'm at (7,2), it's currently quite far away.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns, but for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best move for now is to move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving left to (5,2), then (4,2), eat that apple, and then decide whether to move up towards (4,8) or go for other apples.\n\nI need to be cautious not to run into my own tail as I grow.\n\nAlso, I should keep an eye on snake 1's movements.\n\nBut for this turn, moving left to (6,2) seems like the optimal move.\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is currently at position (7,2). There are apples at (4,8), (7,8), (3,1), (4,2), and (6,2). So, there are multiple apples to go for.\n\nI need to decide which apple to target first and plan a path to get there without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me look at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots\n\n- Row 8: dots with apples at (4,8) and (7,8)\n\n- Row 7: snake 1 at (1,7), rest dots\n\n- Row 6: all dots\n\n- Row 5: all dots\n\n- Row 4: all dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots with apples at (4,2) and (6,2), and my snake at (7,2)\n\n- Row 1: apple at (3,1), rest dots\n\n- Row 0: all dots\n\nColumns: 0 to 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,2), and there are apples at (6,2), (4,2), (3,1), (4,8), and (7,8).\n\nFirst, I should consider the closest apples to minimize the moves needed to get them.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,2) to each apple:\n\n- (6,2): |7-6| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (4,2): |7-4| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,1): |7-3| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (4,8): |7-4| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- (7,8): |7-7| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), which is right next to me. It makes sense to go for that one first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,2).\n\nThen, I can consider moving left again to (5,2), then to (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nFrom there, I can decide whether to go up towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8), or down towards (3,1).\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, move left to (5,2).\n\nThen, move left to (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples and have a longer snake.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to go up towards (4,8) or go down towards (3,1).\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (4,8) is up at row 8, column 4\n\n- (3,1) is down at row 1, column 3\n\nGiven that, going up to (4,8) would require moving up from (4,2) to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, up to (4,8). That's 6 moves up.\n\nAlternatively, going down to (3,1) would require moving down from (4,2) to (4,1), then left to (3,1) to eat the apple. That's 2 moves.\n\nSo, the apple at (3,1) is closer in terms of moves from (4,2).\n\nBut I also need to consider the position of snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 or its body.\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7) and has no body, it's probably moving around, but for now, it's not in my immediate path.\n\nAssuming snake 1 doesn't interfere, it might be better to go for the closer apple at (3,1) next.\n\nSo, after eating (4,2), move down to (4,1), then left to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can consider moving up towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should consider going for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8) directly after eating (4,2).\n\nWait, let's think about the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, up to (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,3), and so on, but that might not be as efficient.\n\nGiven that, moving up from (4,2) towards (4,8) seems reasonable.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apple at (7,8). Maybe I can find a path that allows me to eat both (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nLet's think about a path:\n\n- From (4,2), move up to (4,3)\n\n- Then to (4,4)\n\n- Then to (4,5)\n\n- Then to (4,6)\n\n- Then to (4,7)\n\n- Then to (4,8) to eat the apple\n\n- Then move right to (5,8)\n\n- Then to (6,8)\n\n- Then to (7,8) to eat the apple\n\nThat seems like a possible path, but it's a long way up.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 or any part of my own body along the way.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as my snake grows, I have to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could consider going for the apple at (3,1), which is closer.\n\nLet me compare the distances:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- To (3,1): |4-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (4,8): |4-4| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, the apple at (3,1) is much closer.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), I can then decide whether to go for (4,8) or (7,8).\n\nBut considering that (4,8) is closer to (3,1) than (7,8), it might be better to go for (4,8) next.\n\nFrom (3,1), to (4,1), then (4,2), then (4,3), and up to (4,8).\n\nThen, from (4,8), I can move right to (5,8), then (6,8), then (7,8) to eat the last apple.\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 along the way.\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7), and assuming it moves randomly, I need to keep an eye on its position in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the closest apples first seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Move left to (5,2).\n\n3. Move left to (4,2) to eat the apple.\n\n4. Move down to (4,1).\n\n5. Move left to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\n6. Move up to (3,2), then (3,3), ..., up to (3,8), then right to (4,8) to eat the apple.\n\n7. Move right to (5,8), then (6,8), then (7,8) to eat the last apple.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, directly to (4,8), then to (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to prioritize eating the closest apples first and then proceed to the farther ones.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that if I go for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8), I might be exposing myself to snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, since it's closer to my current position compared to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (7,2), the distance to (7,8) is |2-8|"

There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2). Oh, wait, one of the apples is at (4,2), which is directly above me at (8,2). Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . A . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . A .

There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings of my snake head at (8,2).\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\nPosition (0,2): .\n\nPosition (1,2): .\n\nPosition (2,2): .\n\nPosition (3,2): .\n\nPosition (4,2): A (apple)\n\nPosition (5,2): .\n\nPosition (6,2): A (apple)\n\nPosition (7,2): .\n\nPosition (8,2): 2 (my head)\n\nPosition (9,2): .\n\nLooking at column 2:\n\nRow 0: .\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 2: 2\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 7: .\n\nRow 8: .\n\nRow 9: .\n\nSo, directly above me at (8,3), (8,4), etc., there's nothing until (8,9).\n\nTo the right, at (9,2), it's empty.\n\nTo the left, at (7,2), it's empty.\n\nDown, at (8,1), it's empty.\n\nSo, I can move up, down, left, or right without immediately hitting a wall or another snake.\n\nBut I need to think about longer-term consequences.\n\nFirst, there's an apple at (4,2), which is to the left of me, and another at (6,2), which is to the right.\n\nIf I move left to (7,2), I would be closer to the apple at (4,2), but there's also an apple at (6,2), which is closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (9,2) would take me away from both apples.\n\nWait, no, (6,2) is at (6,2), and I'm at (8,2), so moving left towards (6,2).\n\nWait, in terms of X coordinates, higher X is right, lower X is left.\n\nSo, to get to (6,2) from (8,2), I need to move left.\n\nTo get to (4,2), I need to keep moving left past (6,2).\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (4,2) and (6,2).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nSimilarly, there are apples at (4,8) and (7,8), which are up and to the right.\n\nSnake 1 is at (1,7), but its body is empty, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nBut it's quite far away, at (1,7), and I'm at (8,2), so for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nFirst, let's think about the apples.\n\nIf I move left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple there, then continue left to (5,2), (4,2) to eat that apple, then maybe move up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get blocked by my own body or by snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim directly for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8) by moving up first.\n\nBut that would require me to move up to (8,3), (8,4), etc., and then left or right as needed.\n\nBut I need to consider the distance.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple.\n\nManhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.\n\nFrom (8,2) to (4,8): |8-4| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTo (6,2): |8-6| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nTo (7,8): |8-7| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,1): |8-3| + |2-1| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nTo (4,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), distance 2.\n\nThen (4,2), distance 4.\n\nThen (3,1), distance 5.\n\nThen (7,8), distance 7.\n\nThen (4,8), distance 10.\n\nSo, logically, I should go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nTo get from (8,2) to (6,2), I need to move left twice.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move is safe.\n\nAssuming I move left to (7,2), then left again to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I could aim for (4,2), which is further left.\n\nOr I could consider moving up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up would require me to navigate around the board, potentially encountering snake 1 or my own body.\n\nWait, after eating (6,2), my body would extend, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a body, but since it's not specified, I'll assume my body is just the head for now.\n\nWait, in snake games, typically, the snake has a body that follows the head.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked.\n\nWait, in the board state, '2' is at (8,2), and there are no other '2's, so maybe my body is just the head right now.\n\nOr perhaps the body is not shown in the board state.\n\nThe enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body at [], which might mean it has no body parts besides the head.\n\nGiven that, perhaps my snake also has no body parts besides the head.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, eating an apple increases your length.\n\nBut since this is a multi-apple scenario, perhaps there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one allows you to grow.\n\nBut I need to confirm the rules.\n\nRule 1: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nRule 2: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nRule 3: The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nAssuming that my snake has a body that follows the head, but since it's not shown on the board, perhaps it's just the head for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2' at (8,2) indicates the head and the rest of the body is not visible because it's not on the board.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll assume that my snake has no body besides the head for now.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so the previous position of the head becomes the new tail.\n\nBut since I just moved from (8,2) to (7,2) to (6,2), my tail would be at (7,2).\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,2), my snake has two segments: head at (6,2) and tail at (7,2).\n\nThen, for the next move, I need"

That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is currently at position (7,2). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (8,2), but in the board state, it's shown at (7,2). Hmm, there might be a confusion here.

There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple at (6,2), which is adjacent to me, or plan for longer-term moves to get more apples.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nAt (7,2), I can move:\n\n- Up to (7,3)\n\n- Down to (7,1)\n\n- Left to (6,2) - apple!\n\n- Right to (8,2)\n\nMoving left to (6,2) would let me eat the apple, which is good because I gain a point and grow in length.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,2).\n\nThen, if I continue moving left to (5,2), I need to make sure that the spot is clear and that I don't run into anything.\n\nSimilarly, I could consider moving up from (6,2) towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut that might be a longer path, and I need to make sure I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (4,2), which is further left, but (6,2) is closer.\n\nWait, (6,2) is at (6,2), and I'm at (7,2). So, moving left once to (6,2) to eat it.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can move up towards (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up from (6,2) to (6,3), then (6,4), and so on, would take me closer to (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7) and has no body, it's probably moving around as well, but for now, it's not in my immediate path.\n\nAnother consideration is that there's an apple at (4,2), which is at (4,2), and I'm at (7,2). So, to get to (4,2), I need to move left three times from (7,2) to (4,2).\n\nBut if I do that, I might be leaving myself open to snake 1, or perhaps there are better apples to go for.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (3,1), which is at (3,1), so that's down and left from my current position.\n\nBut the apple at (6,2) is right next to me, so it's hard to ignore.\n\nLet me think about the distances again.\n\nUsing Manhattan distance:\n\nFrom (7,2):\n\n- To (6,2): 1\n\n- To (4,2): 3\n\n- To (7,8): 6\n\n- To (4,8): 5\n\n- To (3,1): 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), followed by (4,2), then (3,1), then (4,8), and finally (7,8).\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can then decide whether to go for (4,2), (3,1), or go upwards towards (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nI need to consider the positions of snake 1 and plan my path accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to keep in mind that after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without running into my own tail.\n\nGiven that, moving left to (6,2) seems like a safe move for now.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can consider moving left again to (5,2), then (4,2) to eat that apple, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up from (6,2) towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's plan a path:\n\n1. Move left to (6,2) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. Move left to (5,2)\n\n3. Move left to (4,2) - eat apple, grow\n\n4. Then, maybe move up to (4,3), (4,4), etc., towards (4,8)\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (4,8) without running into snake 1 or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), etc., but that might not be the most efficient path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (3,1) after (4,2).\n\nBut that might take me further away from the other apples.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, towards (4,8).\n\nThat seems like a reasonable path.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7), and I'm at (7,2), it's currently quite far away.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns, but for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best move for now is to move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving left to (5,2), then (4,2), eat that apple, and then decide whether to move up towards (4,8) or go for other apples.\n\nI need to be cautious not to run into my own tail as I grow.\n\nAlso, I should keep an eye on snake 1's movements.\n\nBut for this turn, moving left to (6,2) seems like the optimal move.\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is currently at position (7,2). There are apples at (4,8), (7,8), (3,1), (4,2), and (6,2). So, there are multiple apples to go for.\n\nI need to decide which apple to target first and plan a path to get there without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me look at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots\n\n- Row 8: dots with apples at (4,8) and (7,8)\n\n- Row 7: snake 1 at (1,7), rest dots\n\n- Row 6: all dots\n\n- Row 5: all dots\n\n- Row 4: all dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots with apples at (4,2) and (6,2), and my snake at (7,2)\n\n- Row 1: apple at (3,1), rest dots\n\n- Row 0: all dots\n\nColumns: 0 to 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,2), and there are apples at (6,2), (4,2), (3,1), (4,8), and (7,8).\n\nFirst, I should consider the closest apples to minimize the moves needed to get them.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,2) to each apple:\n\n- (6,2): |7-6| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (4,2): |7-4| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- (3,1): |7-3| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (4,8): |7-4| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- (7,8): |7-7| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), which is right next to me. It makes sense to go for that one first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,2).\n\nThen, I can consider moving left again to (5,2), then to (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nFrom there, I can decide whether to go up towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8), or down towards (3,1).\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, move left to (5,2).\n\nThen, move left to (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples and have a longer snake.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to go up towards (4,8) or go down towards (3,1).\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (4,8) is up at row 8, column 4\n\n- (3,1) is down at row 1, column 3\n\nGiven that, going up to (4,8) would require moving up from (4,2) to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, up to (4,8). That's 6 moves up.\n\nAlternatively, going down to (3,1) would require moving down from (4,2) to (4,1), then left to (3,1) to eat the apple. That's 2 moves.\n\nSo, the apple at (3,1) is closer in terms of moves from (4,2).\n\nBut I also need to consider the position of snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 or its body.\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7) and has no body, it's probably moving around, but for now, it's not in my immediate path.\n\nAssuming snake 1 doesn't interfere, it might be better to go for the closer apple at (3,1) next.\n\nSo, after eating (4,2), move down to (4,1), then left to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can consider moving up towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should consider going for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8) directly after eating (4,2).\n\nWait, let's think about the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, up to (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,3), and so on, but that might not be as efficient.\n\nGiven that, moving up from (4,2) towards (4,8) seems reasonable.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apple at (7,8). Maybe I can find a path that allows me to eat both (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nLet's think about a path:\n\n- From (4,2), move up to (4,3)\n\n- Then to (4,4)\n\n- Then to (4,5)\n\n- Then to (4,6)\n\n- Then to (4,7)\n\n- Then to (4,8) to eat the apple\n\n- Then move right to (5,8)\n\n- Then to (6,8)\n\n- Then to (7,8) to eat the apple\n\nThat seems like a possible path, but it's a long way up.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 or any part of my own body along the way.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as my snake grows, I have to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could consider going for the apple at (3,1), which is closer.\n\nLet me compare the distances:\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- To (3,1): |4-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (4,8): |4-4| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, the apple at (3,1) is much closer.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), I can then decide whether to go for (4,8) or (7,8).\n\nBut considering that (4,8) is closer to (3,1) than (7,8), it might be better to go for (4,8) next.\n\nFrom (3,1), to (4,1), then (4,2), then (4,3), and up to (4,8).\n\nThen, from (4,8), I can move right to (5,8), then (6,8), then (7,8) to eat the last apple.\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 along the way.\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7), and assuming it moves randomly, I need to keep an eye on its position in future turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the closest apples first seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1.

x2| + |y1 - y2|.\n\nFrom (8,2) to (4,8): |8-4| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTo (6,2): |8-6| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nTo (7,8): |8-7| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,1): |8-3| + |2-1| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nTo (4,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), distance 2.\n\nThen (4,2), distance 4.\n\nThen (3,1), distance 5.\n\nThen (7,8), distance 7.\n\nThen (4,8), distance 10.\n\nSo, logically, I should go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nTo get from (8,2) to (6,2), I need to move left twice.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move is safe.\n\nAssuming I move left to (7,2), then left again to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I could aim for (4,2), which is further left.\n\nOr I could consider moving up to eat the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up would require me to navigate around the board, potentially encountering snake 1 or my own body.\n\nWait, after eating (6,2), my body would extend, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I have a body, but since it's not specified, I'll assume my body is just the head for now.\n\nWait, in snake games, typically, the snake has a body that follows the head.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked.\n\nWait, in the board state, '2' is at (8,2), and there are no other '2's, so maybe my body is just the head right now.\n\nOr perhaps the body is not shown in the board state.\n\nThe enemy snake 1 is at (1,7) with body at [], which might mean it has no body parts besides the head.\n\nGiven that, perhaps my snake also has no body parts besides the head.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, eating an apple increases your length.\n\nBut since this is a multi-apple scenario, perhaps there are multiple apples on the board at once, and eating one allows you to grow.\n\nBut I need to confirm the rules.\n\nRule 1: If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\nRule 2: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nRule 3: The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nAssuming that my snake has a body that follows the head, but since it's not shown on the board, perhaps it's just the head for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2' at (8,2) indicates the head and the rest of the body is not visible because it's not on the board.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll assume that my snake has no body besides the head for now.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2), then to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so the previous position of the head becomes the new tail.\n\nBut since I just moved from (8,2) to (7,2) to (6,2), my tail would be at (7,2).\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,2), my snake has two segments: head at (6,2) and tail at (7,2).\n\nThen, for the next move, I need"

That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is currently at position (7,2). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (8,2), but in the board state, it's shown at (7,2). Hmm, there might be a confusion here. Let's check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots with apples at (4,8) and (7,8)\n\nRow 7: snake 1 at (1,7), rest dots\n\nRow 6: all dots\n\nRow 5: all dots\n\nRow 4: all dots\n\nRow 3: all dots\n\nRow 2: dots with apples at (4,2) and (6,2), and my snake at (7,2)\n\nRow 1: apple at (3,1), rest dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nColumns: 0 to 9\n\nSo, my snake is indeed at (7,2), not (8,2). Maybe there was a mistake in the last move information.\n\nAlright, moving on. There are apples at (4,8), (6,2), (7,8), (3,1), and (4,2).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple at (6,2), which is adjacent to me, or plan for longer-term moves to get more apples.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nAt (7,2), I can move:\n\n- Up to (7,3)\n\n- Down to (7,1)\n\n- Left to (6,2) - apple!\n\n- Right to (8,2)\n\nMoving left to (6,2) would let me eat the apple, which is good because I gain a point and grow in length.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,2).\n\nThen, if I continue moving left to (5,2), I need to make sure that the spot is clear and that I don't run into anything.\n\nSimilarly, I could consider moving up from (6,2) towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut that might be a longer path, and I need to make sure I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (4,2), which is further left, but (6,2) is closer.\n\nWait, (6,2) is at (6,2), and I'm at (7,2). So, moving left once to (6,2) to eat it.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can move up towards (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut moving up from (6,2) to (6,3), then (6,4), and so on, would take me closer to (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7) and has no body, it's probably moving around as well, but for now, it's not in my immediate path.\n\nAnother consideration is that there's an apple at (4,2), which is at (4,2), and I'm at (7,2). So, to get to (4,2), I need to move left three times from (7,2) to (4,2).\n\nBut if I do that, I might be leaving myself open to snake 1, or perhaps there are better apples to go for.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (3,1), which is at (3,1), so that's down and left from my current position.\n\nBut the apple at (6,2) is right next to me, so it's hard to ignore.\n\nLet me think about the distances again.\n\nUsing Manhattan distance:\n\nFrom (7,2):\n\n- To (6,2): 1\n\n- To (4,2): 3\n\n- To (7,8): 6\n\n- To (4,8): 5\n\n- To (3,1): 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,2), followed by (4,2), then (3,1), then (4,8), and finally (7,8).\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,2).\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can then decide whether to go for (4,2), (3,1), or go upwards towards (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nI need to consider the positions of snake 1 and plan my path accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to keep in mind that after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without running into my own tail.\n\nGiven that, moving left to (6,2) seems like a safe move for now.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can consider moving left again to (5,2), then (4,2) to eat that apple, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up from (6,2) towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's plan a path:\n\n1. Move left to (6,2) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. Move left to (5,2)\n\n3. Move left to (4,2) - eat apple, grow\n\n4. Then, maybe move up to (4,3), (4,4), etc., towards (4,8)\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (4,8) without running into snake 1 or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), etc., but that might not be the most efficient path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (3,1) after (4,2).\n\nBut that might take me further away from the other apples.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I could move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, towards (4,8).\n\nThat seems like a reasonable path.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7), and I'm at (7,2), it's currently quite far away.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns, but for now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best move for now is to move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving left to (5,2), then (4,2), eat that apple, and then decide whether to move up towards (4,8) or go for other apples.\n\nI need to be cautious not to run into my own tail as I grow.\n\nAlso, I should keep an eye on snake 1's movements.\n\nBut for this turn, moving left to (6,2) seems like the optimal move.\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

It makes sense to go for that one first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,2).\n\nThen, I can consider moving left again to (5,2), then to (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nFrom there, I can decide whether to go up towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8), or down towards (3,1).\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, move left to (5,2).\n\nThen, move left to (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples and have a longer snake.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to go up towards (4,8) or go down towards (3,1).\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (4,8) is up at row 8, column 4\n\n- (3,1) is down at row 1, column 3\n\nGiven that, going up to (4,8) would require moving up from (4,2) to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, up to (4,8).

That's 2 moves.\n\nSo, the apple at (3,1) is closer in terms of moves from (4,2).\n\nBut I also need to consider the position of snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into snake 1 or its body.\n\nGiven that snake 1 is at (1,7) and has no body, it's probably moving around, but for now, it's not in my immediate path.\n\nAssuming snake 1 doesn't interfere, it might be better to go for the closer apple at (3,1) next.\n\nSo, after eating (4,2), move down to (4,1), then left to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can consider moving up towards the apples at (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should consider going for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8) directly after eating (4,2).\n\nWait, let's think about the positions again.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, up to (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,3), and so on, but that might not be as efficient.\n\nGiven that, moving up from (4,2) towards (4,8) seems reasonable.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apple at (7,8).

Move left to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Move left to (5,2).\n\n3. Move left to (4,2) to eat the apple.\n\n4. Move down to (4,1).\n\n5. Move left to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\n6. Move up to (3,2), then (3,3), ..., up to (3,8), then right to (4,8) to eat the apple.\n\n7. Move right to (5,8), then (6,8), then (7,8) to eat the last apple.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), then (4,4), and so on, directly to (4,8), then to (7,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to prioritize eating the closest apples first and then proceed to the farther ones.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that if I go for the apples at (4,8) and (7,8), I might be exposing myself to snake 1, which is at (1,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (7,8) next, since it's closer to my current position compared to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (7,2), the distance to (7,8) is |2-8|"

So, there are multiple apples to go for.\n\nI need to decide which apple to target first and plan a path to get there without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me look at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots\n\n- Row 8: dots with apples at (4,8) and (7,8)\n\n- Row 7: snake 1 at (0,5) with body at [], rest dots\n\n- Row 6: all dots\n\n- Row 5: all dots\n\n- Row 4: all dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: dots with apples at (4,2) and (8,2), and my snake at (6,3)\n\n- Row 1: apple at (3,1), rest dots\n\n- Row 0: all dots\n\nColumns: 0 to 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (6,3), and there are apples at (4,2), (8,2), (3,1), (4,8), and (7,8).\n\nFirst, I should consider the closest apples to minimize the moves needed to get them.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (6,3) to each apple:\n\n- (4,2): |6-4| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (8,2): |6-8| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,1): |6-3| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (4,8): |6-4| + |3-8| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (7,8): |6-7| + |3-8| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,2) and (8,2), both with a distance of 3.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first. Let's look at the positions:\n\n- (4,2) is to the left and down a bit.\n\n- (8,2) is to the right and down a bit.\n\nI should consider which path is safer and which might lead me closer to other apples.\n\nFirst, let's consider going for (4,2):\n\nFrom (6,3), I can move left to (5,3), then down to (5,2), then left to (4,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,3), left to (5,3), left to (4,3), down to (4,2).\n\nBut the first path is shorter: two moves instead of three.\n\nWait, actually, from (6,3):\n\n1. Left to (5,3)\n\n2. Down to (5,2)\n\n3. Left to (4,2)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Down to (6,2)\n\n2. Left to (5,2)\n\n3. Left to (4,2)\n\nAlso three moves.\n\nBut if I move down first, I might be closer to other apples or potentially put myself in danger.\n\nI need to consider the positions of other snakes.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,5) with no body segments, so it's probably not in my immediate path.\n\nFor now, let's assume it's not a threat.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,2), then left to (5,2), then (4,2) seems okay.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), I can consider moving to (8,2), which is further right.\n\nFrom (4,2), moving right to (5,2), then (6,2), then (7,2), then (8,2).\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving to (3,1) after (4,2), but that would require moving down from (4,2) to (4,1), then left to (3,1).\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nThen, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,2), then right to (4,2), but that would be going back to where I've already been.\n\nWait, no, I need to plan this carefully.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (8,2) first since it's also at distance 3.\n\nFrom (6,3):\n\n1. Right to (7,3)\n\n2. Right to (8,3)\n\n3. Down to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's also three moves.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), I can consider moving left to (7,2), then (6,2), then (5,2), then (4,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,2), I can move up to (8,3), then (8,4), and so on, towards (7,8).\n\nBut that seems farther.\n\nWait, let's calculate the distances again.\n\nAfter eating (8,2), the apples left are (4,2), (3,1), (4,8), and (7,8).\n\nFrom (8,2):\n\n- To (4,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- To (3,1): |8-3| + |2-1| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- To (4,8): |8-4| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (7,8): |8-7| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is (4,2), which is 4 moves away.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), the apples left are (3,1), (4,8), and (7,8).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- To (3,1): |4-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (4,8): |4-4| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, (3,1) is closest, 2 moves away.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), apples left are (4,8) and (7,8).\n\nFrom (3,1):\n\n- To (4,8): |3-4| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- To (7,8): |3-7| + |1-8| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\nSo, (4,8) is closer.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (4,1), then up to (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to (4,8).\n\nThat's 7 moves up.\n\nThen, from (4,8) to (5,8), (6,8), (7,8) to eat the last apple.\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nIn total, from (6,3):\n\n- To (4,2): 3 moves\n\n- To (3,1): 2 moves\n\n- To (4,8): 7 moves\n\n- To (7,8): 3 moves\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 2 + 7 + 3 = 15 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,2) first:\n\n- To (8,2): 3 moves\n\n- To (4,2): 4 moves\n\n- To (3,1): 2 moves\n\n- To (4,8): 7 moves\n\n- To (7,8): 3 moves\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 4 + 2 + 7 + 3 = 19 moves.\n\nSo, going for (4,2) first seems more efficient.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is safe and that I don't run into my own body or other snakes.\n\nAlso, considering that snake #1 is at (0,5), which is quite far from my current position, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the plan to go for the closest apple, which is (4,2).\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left, towards (5,3).\n\nThen, down to (5,2), then left to (4,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, down to (4,1), then left to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, up to (3,2), (3,3), ..., up to"

Left to (4,8) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAfter eating (4,8), the apples left are at (3,1), (4,2), and (8,2).\n\nFrom (4,8):\n\n- To (4,7)\n\n- To (4,6)\n\n- To (4,5)\n\n- To (4,4)\n\n- To (4,3)\n\n- To (4,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), the apples left are at (3,1) and (8,2).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n\n- To (3,2)\n\n- To (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's 2 moves.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), only (8,2) remains.\n\nFrom (3,1):\n\n- Up to (3,2)\n\n- Right to (4,2)\n\n- Right to (5,2)\n\n- Right to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nSo, total moves:\n\n- To (7,8): 4 moves\n\n- To (4,8): 3 moves\n\n- To (4,2): 6 moves\n\n- To (3,1): 2 moves\n\n- To (8,2): 6 moves\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 3 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 21 moves\n\nComparing the two strategies:\n\n- Going to (8,2) first: 20 moves\n\n- Going to (7,8) first: 21 moves\n\nSo, going to (8,2) first seems more efficient.\n\nBut let's consider another approach: going for (4,2) first, which is at a distance of 5 from my current position (7,4).\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 5, but let's recalculate:\n\nFrom (7,4):\n\n- Left"
