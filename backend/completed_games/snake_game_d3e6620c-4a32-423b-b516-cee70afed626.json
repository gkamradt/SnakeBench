The closest apple to me is at (0, 1) or (0, 2), but going for those would put me in a vulnerable position, as I'd have to move all the way to the left and potentially get trapped by the enemy snake.\n\nA better strategy would be to go for the apples at the top, specifically the one at (6, 8) since it's directly above me. This way, I can grow and gain points while also keeping an eye on the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep moving up towards the apple at (6, 8) and be prepared to change direction if the enemy snake gets too close.\n\nNext move: UP"

However, moving directly towards it would put me in the path of Snake #1, which is currently at (6, 1) and could potentially move up towards the apple at (5, 8) as well.\n\nGiven the current positions, it's safer to move towards the apple at (0, 1) or (0, 2), as these are uncontested and in the opposite direction of Snake #1. The apple at (3, 8) is also an option, but it's closer to Snake #1's current position, which could be risky if it decides to move upwards.\n\nTo minimize the risk of running into Snake #1, I will aim for the apple at (0, 1) first. This will also position me well to collect the apple at (0, 2) on the next move. Both of these apples are on the edge of the board, which will limit the movement options for Snake #1 and give me more control over the situation.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be to the left (decreasing the x coordinate) and then up (increasing the y coordinate) to collect the apple at (0, 1). After that, I can move down to (0, 2) to collect the second apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving left to (3, 0), I will move up to collect the apple at (0, 1), and then I will consider moving down to (0, 2) for the next apple, unless the game state changes and requires a different strategy."
