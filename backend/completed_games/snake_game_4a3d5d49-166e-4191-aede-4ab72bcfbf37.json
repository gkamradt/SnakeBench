The closest apple to me is at (4, 0), which is just one step away.\n\nHowever, I also see that there's an enemy snake at position (9, 9) and another one at (2, 8). I need to be careful not to run into them.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the closest apple, which is at (4, 0). I'll try to get as close to it as possible without running into any obstacles.\n\nHmm, I can move either left or right to get closer to the apple. If I move left, I'll be at (7, 0), which is still a bit far from the apple. If I move right, I'll be at (7, 0) as well, but I'll be closer to the apple at (7, 2).\n\nWait, I can move up instead! If I move up, I'll be at (8, 1), which is still a bit far from the apple, but I'll be closer to it than if I move left or right.\n\nBut, I can move up and then left, or up and then right, to get closer to the apple.\n\nOkay, I think I have it. My next move will be... UP."
