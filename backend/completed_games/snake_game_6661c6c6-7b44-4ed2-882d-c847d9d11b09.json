I will prioritize clearing the apple at (6, 8) to maximize point gain and extend my length. Simultaneously, I will ensure that I maintain pathways to access other apples and avoid getting trapped against the board edges or enemy positions. Balancing offensive apple collection with defensive positioning will be crucial to securing the highest possible score by the game's end.\n\n**Decided next move:** RIGHT"

This move positions me closer to the cluster of apples, particularly the one at **(6, 8)**, allowing for efficient point accumulation. Additionally, maintaining a central position provides ample flexibility for subsequent moves, enabling me to navigate around obstacles and avoid potential threats.\n\n**Next turn strategy:** After moving right towards (3, 8), I will continue progressing in the rightward direction to collect nearby apples while monitoring the positions of enemy snakes. I will prioritize clearing the apple at (6, 8) to maximize point gain and extend my length. Simultaneously, I will ensure that I maintain pathways to access other apples and avoid getting trapped against the board edges or enemy positions. Balancing offensive apple collection with defensive positioning will be crucial to securing the highest possible score by the game's end.\n\n**Decided next move:** RIGHT"

Of these, (7,7) is the closest (a Manhattan distance of 3 away from (8,5)).\n\nIf we want to reach (7,7), one good strategy is to start aligning our coordinates. From (8,5), moving LEFT to (7,5) will set us up perfectly so that in a couple of moves upward we can reach (7,7). Checking our board there are no obstacles to the left (at (7,5) the cell is empty), and our own body does not block that move. The enemy snake targets are out of the way, so there is no immediate threat.\n\nThus, I will move LEFT to get closer to the apple at (7,7) and improve our score.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
