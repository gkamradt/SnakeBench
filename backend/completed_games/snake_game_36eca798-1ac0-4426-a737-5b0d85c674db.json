Now see how our candidate moves change our position:\n\n\u2022 If we move LEFT from (6,7) we reach (5,7).  \n\u2003\u2013 From (5,7) the distance to (5,4) becomes |5\u20135| + |7\u20134| = 0+3 = 3.  \n\u2003\u2013 It\u2019s a clear path as we\u2019ll be heading directly west and can then move downwards toward the apple.\n  \n\u2022 If we move DOWN from (6,7) we reach (6,6).  \n\u2003\u2013 Then the distance to (5,4) is |6\u20135| + |6\u20134| = 1+2 = 3 and to (7,4) is the same, 1+2.  \n\u2003\u2013 That\u2019s also good, but moving down might constrict our space later.\n\n\u2022 If we move UP, we\u2019d go to (6,8) which increases our distance to the low-lying apples.\n\nSince our immediate goal is to get closer to (5,4) (or even (7,4)), moving LEFT to (5,7) seems like the best option. It not only brings us closer to the apple (distance drops to 3), but it also sets up a flexible approach for subsequent moves. There\u2019s no risk of running into enemies or walls here.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: By moving LEFT, we keep our options open to then move downward toward the apple at (5,4) while maintaining safe space in our surroundings.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
