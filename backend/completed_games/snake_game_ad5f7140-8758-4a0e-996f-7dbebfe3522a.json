I'm near two apples: (9, 0) which is directly below me, and (5, 1) which is to my left.\n2. Enemy snake #2 is at (9, 7), far from my current position.\n3. I want to prioritize collecting apples efficiently.\n\nStrategy Considerations:\n- The (9, 0) apple is the closest and easiest to collect.\n- The (5, 1) apple might require a more complex path.\n\nThinking Out Loud:\nMy best immediate move is to go DOWN to collect the (9, 0) apple. This will:\n- Gain me a point\n- Keep me within board boundaries\n- Position me strategically for future moves\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After collecting this apple, I'll assess the best route to other apples, possibly targeting (5, 1) next.\n\nDecided Next Move: DOWN"

I'll try to get closer to the apple at (5, 5) and also put some distance between myself and the enemy snake."
