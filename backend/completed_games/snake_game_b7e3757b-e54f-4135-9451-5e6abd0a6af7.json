That will give me an early advantage over the enemy snake.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (0, 8), I'll need to be more cautious and keep an eye out for more apples to continue growing my snake. I'll also need to be aware of the enemy snake's position at (6, 0) and try to avoid running into it or the walls.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving UP to collect the apple at (0, 8), and then reassess the situation to determine the best next move, which could be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP depending on where the next closest apple is and the position of the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: UP."
