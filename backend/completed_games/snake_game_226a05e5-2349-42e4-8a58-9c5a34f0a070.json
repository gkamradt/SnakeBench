The closest and safest route would be to move my snake to the left. Moving up isn't an option since it would lead me very close to the corners and there's no apple there. Going right or down would only increase the distance from the left-side apples.\n\nOne key aspect to keep an eye on would be Snake #2's next move since its close proximity to an apple could potentially lead to a head-on collision if both of us aim for the same target. \n\nMy future strategy may involve me heading towards the middle line where most of the apples seem to be located and then adjusting based on the board's state at the time. \n\nNext move: LEFT."
