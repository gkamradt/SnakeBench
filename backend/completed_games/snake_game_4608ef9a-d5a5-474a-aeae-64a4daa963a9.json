The closest apple is still at (4, 4), which is 1 unit up and 1 unit to the left from my current position.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at position (9, 4) with its body at (8, 4), which is still not a threat to me. My strategy remains the same: to move towards the closest apple at (4, 4) while keeping an eye on Snake #2's movements.\n\nTo get closer to the apple, I need to move up and left. Since I'm already at (5, 3), moving up will bring me to (5, 4), which is at the same y-coordinate as the apple. Then, I can consider moving left to get closer to the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving towards the apple, and if possible, try to position myself in a way that blocks Snake #2's potential path to the apple. I'll prioritize moving up to get closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then consider moving left to get closer to the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nNext turn, I should be prepared to move left if I reach the same y-coordinate as the apple, to get closer to the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nMy decided next move: UP"
