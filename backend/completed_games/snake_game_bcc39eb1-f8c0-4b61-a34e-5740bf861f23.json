The apple at (7, 0) is on the far end of the board, making it less of a priority unless I need to loop around for more apples eventually.\n4.

After consuming the apple at (2, 5), the next nearest apple is at (2, 1) in the same column, which is quite accessible.\n2. Alternatively, the apples at (8, 5) and (8, 6) are still a potential cluster for a two-point gain if traversing to the right is viable without running into walls or encountering the enemy snake.\n3. The apple at (7, 0) is still far and less of a priority at this time.\n4. Always keep an eye on the board updates to ensure no new threats arise, especially keeping track of Snake #2\u2019s position.\n\n**Strategic Observations:**\n- Snake #2 is far from my current area, still giving me some flexibility to move either downwards or rightwards safely at this point.\n- It\u2019s essential to avoid being cornered or moving into a position that could potentially trap me.\n  \n**Deciding the Next Move:**\n- Move down to (2, 4). This step gets us closer to the apple at (2, 1) while allowing flexibility for future movements. By staying in the same column, we have a direct path to the apple without any immediate threats from walls or other snakes, particularly since the enemy snake isn't nearby.\n\n**Strategy Considerations for the Next Turn:**\n- Depending on board changes, particularly Snake #2\u2019s movements, I should remain adaptable while aiming for the apple at (2, 1). \n- After (2, 1), consider heading towards the cluster of apples at (8, 5) and (8, 6) if it remains feasible.\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**"
