But if I don't go for it, Snake #1 might get to it first. Hmm...\n\nI think I'll play it safe again and move up instead. This will give me more options for my next move and keep me away from Snake #1 for now. Plus, I'll be getting closer to the apple at (7, 3).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on Snake #1 and try to get to one of the nearby apples.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

Snake #2 isn't an immediate threat, it's at (7, 3), relatively far from where I will be after eating the apple. \n\nMy strategy for next turn would be to consider moving right or up, depending on my position.

It's far but manageable. Snake #2 is also at my left but it's one space above me. I will avoid moving down because going towards that direction will put me close to Snake #2 and I'll risk colliding with it. So, I'll opt to going upwards to increase the distance between us. \n\nAdditionally, if I move upward, this will take me closer to the apple at (1,6) and I can adjust my direction accordingly when I get there. \n\nMy strategy for the next turn would be to continue moving left to get the apple at (1, 3). However, I should keep an eye on the apple at the top-left corner (0, 7) because it might be good to grab that apple as well if I am near.
