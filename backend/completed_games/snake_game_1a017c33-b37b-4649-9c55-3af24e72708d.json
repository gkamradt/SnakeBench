            "rationale": "**Thinking:**\n\nI'm currently positioned at **(4, 7)**. Let's evaluate my possible moves:\n\n- **UP to (4, 8):**\n  - **Pros:**\n    - Moves closer to the apple at (9, 8).\n    - Keeps me within the upper half of the board, where there's an apple.\n  - **Cons:**\n    - **Risky:** The enemy snake #2 is near at (5, 8). While moving to (4, 8) doesn't result in an immediate collision, it places me in proximity to an enemy that might block access to the apple or pose a threat in subsequent moves.\n\n- **DOWN to (4, 6):**\n  - **Pros:**\n    - Moves towards the lower half of the board, making it easier to access the apple at (5, 1).\n    - Reduces immediate threat from the enemy snake occupying the upper rows.\n  - **Cons:**\n    - **Slower Access:** It's farther from multiple apples, potentially delaying point accumulation.\n    - **Potential Path Obstruction:** Depending on my snake's body length, moving down might limit future movement options.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n  - **Pros:**\n    - Heads directly towards the apple at (8, 7), which is relatively close.\n    - Keeps me moving towards the center-right of the board, a strategic position for accessing multiple apples.\n  - **Cons:**\n    - **Uncertainty:** Moving right brings me closer to the enemy snake's vicinity, especially if their movements change. However, current positions don't pose an immediate threat.\n\n- **LEFT to (3, 7):**\n  - **Pros:**\n    - Proactively moves away from the enemy snake's current positions, enhancing safety.\n    - Opens a path towards the apple at (2, 3), ensuring steady point accumulation without immediate threats.\n    - Maintains flexibility for future navigations without constraining my movement options.\n  - **Cons:**\n    - **Distance from Apples:** Moves me away from some centrally located apples, potentially delaying access to them.\n\n**Safety Considerations:**\n- **Walls:** All potential moves keep me within the 10x10 board boundaries.\n- **Enemy Snakes:** \n  - Moving **RIGHT to (5, 7)** keeps me nearer to the enemy snake's current positions, but there's no immediate collision risk.\n  - Moving **UP to (4, 8)** places me near the enemy snake's proximity, which could be risky if not navigated carefully.\n- **Self-Collision:** None of the potential moves suggest an immediate risk of colliding with my own body based on current information.\n\n**Strategy:**\nPrioritize a balance between safety and efficient apple collection. Moving **RIGHT to (5, 7)** allows me to approach the nearby apple at (8, 7) while keeping a manageable distance from the enemy snake. Additionally, positioning towards the center-right provides better access to multiple apples without venturing too close to the enemy's positions.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"
