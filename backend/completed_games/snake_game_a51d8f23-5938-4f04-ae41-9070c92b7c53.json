After collecting the apple at (9, 0), I will be at the bottom edge of the board, and I must turn to avoid hitting the wall.\n\nLooking at the board, the nearest apple that I can safely move towards is at (8, 4). To get there, I should turn left and move towards the center of the board. This move will also put some distance between me and the enemy snake, which is currently at (7, 5) and moving downwards. It's important to avoid getting too close to the enemy snake, as this could lead to a collision.\n\nThe apple at (5, 4) is in the path towards the apple at (8, 4), so I can collect it as well on my way. After collecting the apple at (8, 4), I will have multiple options to consider for the next apples, but for now, the strategy is to move towards the center of the board and away from the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, after collecting the apple at (9, 0), my next move should be to the left, which is decreasing the x coordinate.\n\nNext move: LEFT.\n\nStrategy for the next turn after moving left: Continue moving towards the apple at (8, 4) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adjusting my path accordingly to maintain a safe distance and avoid any potential collisions."
