            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (2,2). There are apples at (6,4), (4,8), (3,8), (8,8), and (7,8). \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the apples are mostly clustered around the top part, especially around y=8. There's one apple at (6,4), which is a bit lower down. My snake is at (2,2), which is near the bottom left. \n\nI need to decide whether to go for the lower apple or the cluster of apples at the top. Since I'm starting from (2,2), moving towards (6,4) would require moving right and up. Alternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up more, but that's a longer distance. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (0,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That means it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into its area. \n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go towards (6,4), I can move right and up. From (2,2), moving right would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), and so on. But I need to check if that path is clear. Since the enemy snake is at (0,3), which is far from my current position, I don't think I'll interfere with it. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean going up several times. From (2,2), moving up to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., until I reach y=8. But that's a longer path, and I might be exposed to more risks, especially if the enemy snake decides to move towards me. \n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of growing. If I eat an apple, I grow, which might help me avoid certain dangers, but I also have to be careful not to get trapped. \n\nI should also think about the direction I was moving last. The last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction now. \n\nHmm, maybe I should prioritize the closest apple first. The apple at (6,4) is closer than the ones at y=8. Let me calculate the distance. From (2,2) to (6,4) is a distance of 4 right and 2 up moves. That's 6 moves. To get to (3,8), it's 1 right and 6 up moves, which is 7 moves. So, the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (6,4) is in the middle of the board, and there are other apples around it. Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move diagonally, but in this game, I can only move in four directions, not diagonally. So, I have to choose either right or up each time. \n\nSo, the first move should be right to (3,2). Then, continue moving right until I reach x=6, then move up. \n\nBut wait, I should check if moving right is safe. Are there any walls or other snakes in that path? The board is 10x10, so moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is within the board. There are no other snakes in that area, as per the given information. \n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the cluster first. But the distance is longer, and I might miss out on the closer apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I could reach y=4 faster, but I'd have to move further right. But since the apple is at (6,4), I need to reach x=6 regardless. So, moving right first is more efficient. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction. So, moving right is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to the right, heading towards the closest apple at (6,4).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (2,2).\n2. **Apples Available:** The closest apple is at (6,4), requiring moving right 4 times and up 2 times.\n3. **Path Safety:** The path to (6,4) is clear of walls, other snakes, and self-intersection.\n4. **Efficiency:** Moving right first is more efficient as it directly targets the x-coordinate of the apple.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to gain points quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

Therefore, the best strategy is to move directly towards that apple, ensuring that I do not move into a position that would put me in danger on the subsequent turn.\n\nSince my current position is (0, 3), I will move UP to (0, 4) on this turn, which is the first step towards the apple at (4, 8).

So, I have to choose either right or up each time. \n\nSo, the first move should be right to (3,2). Then, continue moving right until I reach x=6, then move up. \n\nBut wait, I should check if moving right is safe. Are there any walls or other snakes in that path? The board is 10x10, so moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is within the board. There are no other snakes in that area, as per the given information. \n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the cluster first. But the distance is longer, and I might miss out on the closer apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction. So, moving right is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I could reach y=4 faster, but I'd have to move further right. But since the apple is at (6,4), I need to reach x=6 regardless. So, moving right first is more efficient. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (2,2).\n2. **Apples Available:** The closest apple is at (6,4), requiring moving right 4 times and up 2 times.\n3. **Path Safety:** The path to (6,4) is clear of walls, other snakes, and self-intersection.\n4. **Efficiency:** Moving right first is more efficient as it directly targets the x-coordinate of the apple.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to gain points quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (2,2). There are apples at (6,4), (4,8), (3,8), (8,8), and (7,8). \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the apples are mostly clustered around the top part, especially around y=8. There's one apple at (6,4), which is a bit lower down. My snake is at (2,2), which is near the bottom left. \n\nI need to decide whether to go for the lower apple or the cluster of apples at the top. Since I'm starting from (2,2), moving towards (6,4) would require moving right and up. Alternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up more, but that's a longer distance. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (0,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That means it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into its area. \n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go towards (6,4), I can move right and up. From (2,2), moving right would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), and so on. But I need to check if that path is clear. Since the enemy snake is at (0,3), which is far from my current position, I don't think I'll interfere with it. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean going up several times. From (2,2), moving up to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., until I reach y=8. But that's a longer path, and I might be exposed to more risks, especially if the enemy snake decides to move towards me. \n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of growing. If I eat an apple, I grow, which might help me avoid certain dangers, but I also have to be careful not to get trapped. \n\nI should also think about the direction I was moving last. The last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction now. \n\nHmm, maybe I should prioritize the closest apple first. The apple at (6,4) is closer than the ones at y=8. Let me calculate the distance. From (2,2) to (6,4) is a distance of 4 right and 2 up moves. That's 6 moves. To get to (3,8), it's 1 right and 6 up moves, which is 7 moves. So, the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (6,4) is in the middle of the board, and there are other apples around it. Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move diagonally, but in this game, I can only move in four directions, not diagonally. So, I have to choose either right or up each time. \n\nSo, the first move should be right to (3,2).

The board is 10x10, so moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is within the board. There are no other snakes in that area, as per the given information. \n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the cluster first. But the distance is longer, and I might miss out on the closer apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction. So, moving right is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the cluster, but that's still a longer path. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (2,2).\n2. **Apples Available:** The closest apple is at (6,4), requiring moving right 4 times and up 2 times.\n3. **Path Safety:** The path to (6,4) is clear of walls, other snakes, and self-intersection.\n4. **Efficiency:** Moving right first is more efficient as it directly targets the x-coordinate of the apple.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to gain points quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</response>\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (2,2). There are apples at (6,4), (4,8), (3,8), (8,8), and (7,8). \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the apples are mostly clustered around the top part, especially around y=8. There's one apple at (6,4), which is a bit lower down. My snake is at (2,2), which is near the bottom left. \n\nI need to decide whether to go for the lower apple or the cluster of apples at the top. Since I'm starting from (2,2), moving towards (6,4) would require moving right and up. Alternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up more, but that's a longer distance. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (0,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That means it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into its area. \n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go towards (6,4), I can move right and up. From (2,2), moving right would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), and so on. But I need to check if that path is clear. Since the enemy snake is at (0,3), which is far from my current position, I don't think I'll interfere with it. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean going up several times. From (2,2), moving up to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., until I reach y=8. But that's a longer path, and I might be exposed to more risks, especially if the enemy snake decides to move towards me. \n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of growing. If I eat an apple, I grow, which might help me avoid certain dangers, but I also have to be careful not to get trapped. \n\nI should also think about the direction I was moving last. The last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction now. \n\nHmm, maybe I should prioritize the closest apple first. The apple at (6,4) is closer than the ones at y=8. Let me calculate the distance. From (2,2) to (6,4) is a distance of 4 right and 2 up moves. That's 6 moves. To get to (3,8), it's 1 right and 6 up moves, which is 7 moves. So, the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (6,4) is in the middle of the board, and there are other apples around it. Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move diagonally, but in this game, I can only move in four directions, not diagonally. So, I have to choose either right or up each time. \n\nSo, the first move should be right to (3,2). Then, continue moving right until I reach x=6, then move up. \n\nBut wait, I should check if moving right is safe. Are there any walls or other snakes in that path? The board is 10x10, so moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is within the board. There are no other snakes in that area, as per the given information. \n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple.

So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I could reach y=4 faster, but I'd have to move further right. But since the apple is at (6,4), I need to reach x=6 regardless. So, moving right first is more efficient. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction.

Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the cluster first. But the distance is longer, and I might miss out on the closer apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction. So, moving right is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the cluster, but that's still a longer path. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (2,2).\n2. **Apples Available:** The closest apple is at (6,4), requiring moving right 4 times and up 2 times.\n3. **Path Safety:** The path to (6,4) is clear of walls, other snakes, and self-intersection.\n4. **Efficiency:** Moving right first is more efficient as it directly targets the x-coordinate of the apple.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to gain points quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</response>\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (2,2). There are apples at (6,4), (4,8), (3,8), (8,8), and (7,8). \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the apples are mostly clustered around the top part, especially around y=8. There's one apple at (6,4), which is a bit lower down. My snake is at (2,2), which is near the bottom left. \n\nI need to decide whether to go for the lower apple or the cluster of apples at the top. Since I'm starting from (2,2), moving towards (6,4) would require moving right and up. Alternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up more, but that's a longer distance. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (0,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That means it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into its area. \n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go towards (6,4), I can move right and up. From (2,2), moving right would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), and so on. But I need to check if that path is clear. Since the enemy snake is at (0,3), which is far from my current position, I don't think I'll interfere with it. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up several times. From (2,2), moving up to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., until I reach y=8. But that's a longer path, and I might be exposed to more risks, especially if the enemy snake decides to move towards me. \n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of growing. If I eat an apple, I grow, which might help me avoid certain dangers, but I also have to be careful not to get trapped. \n\nI should also think about the direction I was moving last. The last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction now. \n\nHmm, maybe I should prioritize the closest apple first. The apple at (6,4) is closer than the ones at y=8. Let me calculate the distance. From (2,2) to (6,4) is a distance of 4 right and 2 up moves. That's 6 moves. To get to (3,8), it's 1 right and 6 up moves, which is 7 moves. So, the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (6,4) is in the middle of the board, and there are other apples around it. Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple.

My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (2,2).\n2. **Apples Available:** The closest apple is at (6,4), requiring moving right 4 times and up 2 times.\n3. **Path Safety:** The path to (6,4) is clear of walls, other snakes, and self-intersection.\n4. **Efficiency:** Moving right first is more efficient as it directly targets the x-coordinate of the apple.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to gain points quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

The last move was UP to (0, 4), which was the correct move to start heading towards the apple at (4, 8). Now, we need to continue moving towards that apple while ensuring we don't collide with any obstacles.\n\nSince we are currently at (0, 4), the next move should be to the right, towards the apple at (4, 8). This move will not put us in immediate danger of hitting Snake #1, which is currently at (3, 2), or the walls. It also does not put us at risk of colliding with ourselves since we are moving away from our own tail.\n\nThe strategy for the next turn will depend on the apples that remain and the positions of the enemy snakes.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (2,2). There are apples at (6,4), (4,8), (3,8), (8,8), and (7,8). \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the apples are mostly clustered around the top part, especially around y=8. There's one apple at (6,4), which is a bit lower down. My snake is at (2,2), which is near the bottom left. \n\nI need to decide whether to go for the lower apple or the cluster of apples at the top. Since I'm starting from (2,2), moving towards (6,4) would require moving right and up. Alternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up more, but that's a longer distance. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (0,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That means it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into its area. \n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go towards (6,4), I can move right and up. From (2,2), moving right would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), and so on. But I need to check if that path is clear. Since the enemy snake is at (0,3), which is far from my current position, I don't think I'll interfere with it. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up several times. From (2,2), moving up to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., until I reach y=8. But that's a longer path, and I might be exposed to more risks, especially if the enemy snake decides to move towards me. \n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of growing. If I eat an apple, I grow, which might help me avoid certain dangers, but I also have to be careful not to get trapped. \n\nI should also think about the direction I was moving last. The last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction now. \n\nHmm, maybe I should prioritize the closest apple first. The apple at (6,4) is closer than the ones at y=8. Let me calculate the distance. From (2,2) to (6,4) is a distance of 4 right and 2 up moves. That's 6 moves. To get to (3,8), it's 1 right and 6 up moves, which is 7 moves. So, the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (6,4) is in the middle of the board, and there are other apples around it. Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move diagonally, but in this game, I can only move in four directions, not diagonally. So, I have to choose either right or up each time. \n\nSo, the first move should be right to (3,2). Then, continue moving right until I reach x=6, then move up. \n\nBut wait, I should check if moving right is safe. Are there any walls or other snakes in that path? The board is 10x10, so moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is within the board. There are no other snakes in that area, as per the given information. \n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the cluster first. But the distance is longer, and I might miss out on the closer apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (2,2). There are apples at (6,4), (4,8), (3,8), (8,8), and (7,8). \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the apples are mostly clustered around the top part, especially around y=8. There's one apple at (6,4), which is a bit lower down. My snake is at (2,2), which is near the bottom left. \n\nI need to decide whether to go for the lower apple or the cluster of apples at the top. Since I'm starting from (2,2), moving towards (6,4) would require moving right and up. Alternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up more, but that's a longer distance. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (0,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That means it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into its area. \n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go towards (6,4), I can move right and up. From (2,2), moving right would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), and so on. But I need to check if that path is clear. Since the enemy snake is at (0,3), which is far from my current position, I don't think I'll interfere with it. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean going up several times. From (2,2), moving up to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., until I reach y=8. But that's a longer path, and I might be exposed to more risks, especially if the enemy snake decides to move towards me. \n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of growing. If I eat an apple, I grow, which might help me avoid certain dangers, but I also have to be careful not to get trapped. \n\nI should also think about the direction I was moving last. The last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction now. \n\nHmm, maybe I should prioritize the closest apple first. The apple at (6,4) is closer than the ones at y=8. Let me calculate the distance. From (2,2) to (6,4) is a distance of 4 right and 2 up moves. That's 6 moves. To get to (3,8), it's 1 right and 6 up moves, which is 7 moves. So, the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (6,4) is in the middle of the board, and there are other apples around it. Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move diagonally, but in this game, I can only move in four directions, not diagonally. So, I have to choose either right or up each time. \n\nSo, the first move should be right to (3,2). Then, continue moving right until I reach x=6, then move up. \n\nBut wait, I should check if moving right is safe. Are there any walls or other snakes in that path? The board is 10x10, so moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is within the board. There are no other snakes in that area, as per the given information. \n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the cluster first. But the distance is longer, and I might miss out on the closer apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I could reach y=4 faster, but I'd have to move further right. But since the apple is at (6,4), I need to reach x=6 regardless. So, moving right first is more efficient. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction. So, moving right is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to the right, heading towards the closest apple at (6,4).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (2,2).\n2. **Apples Available:** The closest apple is at (6,4), requiring moving right 4 times and up 2 times.\n3. **Path Safety:** The path to (6,4) is clear of walls, other snakes, and self-intersection.\n4. **Efficiency:** Moving right first is more efficient as it directly targets the x-coordinate of the apple.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to gain points quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

Looking at the board, the nearest apple for Snake #2 is at (4, 8). To get there, I need to move up and then right. However, I must ensure that my path does not cross Snake #1, which is currently at (2, 2).\n\nGiven that Snake #1 has no body parts listed, it is safe to assume that it is not immediately threatening my path to the apple at (4, 8). Therefore, the best strategy is to move directly towards that apple, ensuring that I do not move into a position that would put me in danger on the subsequent turn.\n\nSince my current position is (0, 3), I will move UP to (0, 4) on this turn, which is the first step towards the apple at (4, 8). This move also keeps me at a safe distance from Snake #1 and the walls.\n\nNext turn, I will need to reassess the board state to decide whether to continue moving towards the apple at (4, 8) or if there is a closer or safer apple to pursue based on the movements of other snakes and the apples that may have been eaten.\n\nFor this turn, the decision is: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (2,2). There are apples at (6,4), (4,8), (3,8), (8,8), and (7,8). \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the apples are mostly clustered around the top part, especially around y=8. There's one apple at (6,4), which is a bit lower down. My snake is at (2,2), which is near the bottom left. \n\nI need to decide whether to go for the lower apple or the cluster of apples at the top. Since I'm starting from (2,2), moving towards (6,4) would require moving right and up. Alternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up more, but that's a longer distance. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (0,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That means it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into its area. \n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go towards (6,4), I can move right and up. From (2,2), moving right would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), and so on. But I need to check if that path is clear. Since the enemy snake is at (0,3), which is far from my current position, I don't think I'll interfere with it. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean going up several times. From (2,2), moving up to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., until I reach y=8. But that's a longer path, and I might be exposed to more risks, especially if the enemy snake decides to move towards me. \n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of growing. If I eat an apple, I grow, which might help me avoid certain dangers, but I also have to be careful not to get trapped. \n\nI should also think about the direction I was moving last. The last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction now. \n\nHmm, maybe I should prioritize the closest apple first. The apple at (6,4) is closer than the ones at y=8. Let me calculate the distance. From (2,2) to (6,4) is a distance of 4 right and 2 up moves. That's 6 moves. To get to (3,8), it's 1 right and 6 up moves, which is 7 moves. So, the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (6,4) is in the middle of the board, and there are other apples around it. Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move diagonally, but in this game, I can only move in four directions, not diagonally. So, I have to choose either right or up each time. \n\nSo, the first move should be right to (3,2). Then, continue moving right until I reach x=6, then move up. \n\nBut wait, I should check if moving right is safe. Are there any walls or other snakes in that path? The board is 10x10, so moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is within the board. There are no other snakes in that area, as per the given information. \n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the cluster first. But the distance is longer, and I might miss out on the closer apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction. So, moving right is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I could reach y=4 faster, but I'd have to move further right. But since the apple is at (6,4), I need to reach x=6 regardless. So, moving right first is more efficient. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (2,2).\n2. **Apples Available:** The closest apple is at (6,4), requiring moving right 4 times and up 2 times.\n3. **Path Safety:** The path to (6,4) is clear of walls, other snakes, and self-intersection.\n4. **Efficiency:** Moving right first is more efficient as it directly targets the x-coordinate of the apple.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to gain points quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3), but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4).

Therefore, the best strategy is to move directly towards that apple, ensuring that I do not move into a position that would put me in danger on the subsequent turn.\n\nSince my current position is (0, 3), I will move UP to (0, 4) on this turn, which is the first step towards the apple at (4, 8). This move also keeps me at a safe distance from Snake #1 and the walls.\n\nNext turn, I will need to reassess the board state to decide whether to continue moving towards the apple at (4, 8) or if there is a closer or safer apple to pursue based on the movements of other snakes and the apples that may have been eaten.\n\nFor this turn, the decision is: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (2,2). There are apples at (6,4), (4,8), (3,8), (8,8), and (7,8). \n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the apples are mostly clustered around the top part, especially around y=8. There's one apple at (6,4), which is a bit lower down. My snake is at (2,2), which is near the bottom left. \n\nI need to decide whether to go for the lower apple or the cluster of apples at the top. Since I'm starting from (2,2), moving towards (6,4) would require moving right and up. Alternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean moving up more, but that's a longer distance. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (0,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That means it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into its area. \n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go towards (6,4), I can move right and up. From (2,2), moving right would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), and so on. But I need to check if that path is clear. Since the enemy snake is at (0,3), which is far from my current position, I don't think I'll interfere with it. \n\nAlternatively, moving towards the top cluster would mean going up several times. From (2,2), moving up to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., until I reach y=8. But that's a longer path, and I might be exposed to more risks, especially if the enemy snake decides to move towards me. \n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of growing. If I eat an apple, I grow, which might help me avoid certain dangers, but I also have to be careful not to get trapped. \n\nI should also think about the direction I was moving last. The last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction now. \n\nHmm, maybe I should prioritize the closest apple first. The apple at (6,4) is closer than the ones at y=8. Let me calculate the distance. From (2,2) to (6,4) is a distance of 4 right and 2 up moves. That's 6 moves. To get to (3,8), it's 1 right and 6 up moves, which is 7 moves. So, the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (6,4) is in the middle of the board, and there are other apples around it. Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move diagonally, but in this game, I can only move in four directions, not diagonally. So, I have to choose either right or up each time. \n\nSo, the first move should be right to (3,2). Then, continue moving right until I reach x=6, then move up. \n\nBut wait, I should check if moving right is safe. Are there any walls or other snakes in that path? The board is 10x10, so moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is within the board. There are no other snakes in that area, as per the given information. \n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the cluster first. But the distance is longer, and I might miss out on the closer apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction. So, moving right is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I could reach y=4 faster, but I'd have to move further right. But since the apple is at (6,4), I need to reach x=6 regardless. So, moving right first is more efficient. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (2,2).\n2. **Apples Available:** The closest apple is at (6,4), requiring moving right 4 times and up 2 times.\n3. **Path Safety:** The path to (6,4) is clear of walls, other snakes, and self-intersection.\n4. **Efficiency:** Moving right first is more efficient as it directly targets the x-coordinate of the apple.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to gain points quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

It also does not put us at risk of colliding with ourselves since we are moving away from our own tail.\n\nThe strategy for the next turn will depend on the apples that remain and the positions of the enemy snakes.

Maybe after eating that one, I can move towards the cluster. But I should also consider if moving towards (6,4) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that at y=4, there's an apple at (6,4), but I don't see any other snakes or my own body in that area. \n\nWait, my snake's body is not mentioned, so I assume it's just the head at (2,2) and no body yet. So, I can move freely without worrying about my own body blocking me. \n\nSo, the plan is to move towards (6,4). Let me think about the path. From (2,2), moving right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3), then right to (3,3), and so on. But that would take more steps. So, moving right first seems more efficient. \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be increasing my x-coordinate. The apple is at x=6, so I need to go from x=2 to x=6, which is 4 steps right. Then, from y=2 to y=4, which is 2 steps up. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the enemy snake at (0,3), but that's still two rows away, so it's not a direct threat. \n\nI think moving right is the better option because it's more direct towards the apple. Plus, moving right increases my x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach the apple at (6,4). \n\nWait, but if I move right, I'll be going towards the center of the board, which might be a more contested area. But since there's only one enemy snake at (0,3), which is far away, I don't think I'll have immediate conflicts. \n\nAnother thought: after eating the apple at (6,4), I can then move towards the cluster at y=8. That way, I can maximize the points. But I need to make sure that after growing, I don't get stuck. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3), but that would take me further away from the x-coordinate of the apple. \n\nI think the optimal strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (6,4). So, my next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but the last move information says the direction was None, so I can choose any direction. So, moving right is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first, but that would take me to (2,3), which is closer to the cluster, but that's still a longer path. \n\nI think I'm convinced. My next move should be to the right, taking me to (3,2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move right, I'm heading towards x=6, which is the x-coordinate of the apple. So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, I could move up first to (2,3) to get closer to the cluster, but that seems counterproductive since the apple at (6,4) is closer. \n\nNo, I think moving right is the way to go. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple, and it's safe. \n\nSo, my next move is to the right.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"
