            "rationale": "**Thinking:**\n\nI'm currently positioned at **(5, 7)** on a 10x10 board. My objective remains to collect apples while avoiding collisions with walls, enemy snakes, and myself. Let's evaluate my possible moves:\n\n1. **UP to (5, 8):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (5, 8) is unoccupied and within board boundaries. There's no immediate threat, making this move safe.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** Moving UP doesn't bring me closer to any apples. The nearest apples are still (5, 4), (6, 3), and (8, 5).\n   - **Strategic Advantage:** While safe, this move doesn't advance me toward any objectives. It maintains my position without progress.\n   - **Conclusion:** **Safe but Less Advantageous.** Not the optimal choice for maximizing points.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 6):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (5, 6) is within board boundaries and appears unoccupied by enemy snakes or my own body.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** Moving DOWN positions me closer to the apple at (5, 4) and maintains proximity to the apple at (6, 3). This aligns well with my goal of collecting apples.\n   - **Strategic Advantage:** This move not only brings me closer to an apple but also keeps multiple paths open for future apple collection.\n   - **Conclusion:** **Safe and Strategic.** A strong candidate for the next move.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 7):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (4, 7) is within board boundaries and appears unoccupied.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** Moving LEFT takes me away from the cluster of apples. The nearest apples remain at (5, 4) and (6, 3).\n   - **Strategic Advantage:** This move doesn't contribute directly to apple collection and could limit access to nearby apples.\n   - **Conclusion:** **Safe but Less Advantageous.** Not the optimal choice for maximizing points.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (6, 7) is currently occupied by my tail (`T`). In many snake game implementations, it's safe to move into the tail's current position as it will vacate in the next move.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** Moving RIGHT doesn't bring me closer to any apples and takes me away from the primary cluster of apples.\n   - **Strategic Advantage:** While safe, this move doesn't advance me toward any objectives and may limit access to nearby apples.\n   - **Conclusion:** **Potentially Safe but Less Advantageous.** Not the optimal choice for maximizing points.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nTo maximize points while ensuring safety, prioritizing moves that bring me closer to available apples is essential. Moving **DOWN to (5, 6)** not only brings me closer to the apple at (5, 4) but also keeps me within reach of the apple at (6, 3). Additionally, this move maintains multiple future pathways for apple collection, enhancing my strategic positioning on the board.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"
