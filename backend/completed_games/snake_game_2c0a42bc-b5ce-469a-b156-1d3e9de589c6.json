            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,6). The apples are located at (2,9), (7,8), (6,2), (3,9), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at position (1,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (0,6), which is on the bottom row, seventh cell from the left. There's another snake at (1,0), which is just below me, on the very bottom row, second cell from the left.\n\nApples are scattered around:\n\n- (2,9): that's towards the top, third row from the top, tenth cell from the left.\n\n- (7,8): towards the top, eighth row from the bottom, ninth cell from the left.\n\n- (6,2): towards the bottom, seventh row from the top, third cell from the left.\n\n- (3,9): towards the top, fourth row from the top, tenth cell from the left.\n\n- (4,6): towards the middle, fifth row from the top, seventh cell from the left.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the closest apple. Let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- To (2,9): |0-2| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- To (7,8): |0-7| + |6-8| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n- To (6,2): |0-6| + |6-2| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- To (3,9): |0-3| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (4,6): |0-4| + |6-6| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just four moves away. Let's see if that's a feasible path.\n\nFrom (0,6) to (4,6): I need to move right four times. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 6: 9 . . A A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (0,6), moving right to (4,6):\n\n- (0,6) to (1,6): clear\n\n- (1,6) to (2,6): clear\n\n- (2,6) to (3,6): clear\n\n- (3,6) to (4,6): apple!\n\nLooks good. No obstacles in the way. So, I can safely move right four times to eat the apple at (4,6).\n\nBut, I should think ahead. After eating that apple, I'll grow in length, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail in the process.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are better apples to go for that might set me up for eating more apples in sequence.\n\nLet me look at the board again. After eating (4,6), I could potentially go up to (4,9) to eat (3,9) or (2,9), but that seems a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going towards (2,9), but that's a bit further away, and I'd have to navigate around any potential obstacles.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (2,9), and (3,9), and (7,8), and (6,2).\n\nI need to think about the order in which to eat the apples to maximize the number I can eat before having to worry about running into walls or other snakes.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (4,6): closest, 4 moves right.\n\n- After eating (4,6), I can continue right to (7,6), but there are no apples there.\n\n- Or, I can go up to (4,9), but that's a few moves up, and there are no apples directly in that path.\n\nWait, (3,9) is at (3,9), which is up and left from (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6) to (3,9):\n\n- Left once to (3,6)\n\n- Up three times to (3,9)\n\nThat's a total of four moves after eating (4,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that in the process, I don't run into my own tail or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), I could go right to (7,6), but there are no apples there. Then up to (7,8), which has an apple.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (7,6):\n\n- Right three times to (7,6)\n\n- Then up two times to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves in total after eating (4,6).\n\nSo, total moves from current position:\n\n- To (4,6): 4 moves right\n\n- To (7,6): 3 moves right\n\n- To (7,8): 2 moves up\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 moves\n\nBut, I need to make sure that in these moves, I don't run into anything.\n\nAlso, considering the other apple at (6,2), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (7,8), I could potentially go down to (7,2), then left to (6,2), but that's a long path and might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), I could go down to (4,2), then right to (6,2), but that's also a few moves.\n\nI need to prioritize the closest apples and think about the path that allows me to eat the most apples with the least moves.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (1,6)\n\n2. Move right to (2,6)\n\n3. Move right to (3,6)\n\n4. Move right to (4,6) - eat apple, grow\n\n5. Move right to (5,6)\n\n6. Move right to (6,6)\n\n7. Move right to (7,6)\n\n8. Move up to (7,7)\n\n9. Move up to (7,8) - eat apple, grow\n\nAfter eating the second apple, I can consider where to go next.\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown by two segments.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into my own tail or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, snake #1 is at (1,0), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movement, but for now, it's at (1,0), which is below me.\n\nAs I move up towards the apples, it might move up as well, so I need to be cautious not to run into it.\n\nBut for the immediate moves, it should be safe.\n\nSo, sticking with the plan:\n\nMove right to (1,6)\n\nThen right to (2,6)\n\nThen right to (3,6)\n\nThen right to (4,6) - eat apple\n\nThen right to (5,6)\n\nThen right to (6,6)\n\nThen right to (7,6)\n\nThen up to (7,7)\n\nThen up to (7,8) - eat apple\n\nThat's a total of 9 moves.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going to (6,2), which is down and to the left.\n\nFrom (7,8), I would need to move down to (7,7), then (7,6), then (7,5), and so on, down to (7,2), then left to (6,2).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail in the process.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,8), I could go left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) - eat apple.\n\nThat's seven moves from (7,8) to (6,2).\n\nTotal moves so far: 9 (to (7,8)) + 7 = 16 moves.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can consider going to (2,9) or (3,9).\n\n(2,9) is up and left from (6,2).\n\nFrom (6,2), up to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), ("

A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nSo, apples are at rows 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nMy snake is at (0,7), which is on row 7, column 0.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. To do that, I should calculate the distance to each apple and see which one is closest.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance for each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (2,9):\n\n- Distance = |0-2| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (7,8):\n\n- Distance = |0-7| + |7-8| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Distance = |0-6| + |7-2| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n4. Apple at (3,9):\n\n- Distance = |0-3| + |7-9| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Distance = |0-4| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,9) with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to plan the path to (2,9). From (0,7), I need to move right to increase my x-coordinate to 2 and up to increase my y-coordinate to 9.\n\nBut wait, in this game, increasing y-coordinate is moving up, and increasing x-coordinate is moving right.\n\nSo, from (0,7), to reach (2,9):\n\n- Move right twice (to x=2)\n\n- Move up two times (to y=9)\n\nThat seems straightforward. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (0,7) to (1,7): clear\n\n- From (1,7) to (2,7): clear\n\n- From (2,7) to (2,8): clear\n\n- From (2,8) to (2,9): apple!\n\nSo, the path seems clear. No other snakes or walls in the way.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (2,9), I will grow in length by one segment. So, I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a straight line and the board is relatively empty, I should be fine.\n\nHowever, there are other apples on the board, and I need to think about a sequence that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the other apples after I eat (2,9):\n\n- (7,8): now at a distance of |2-7| + |9-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,2): |2-6| + |9-2| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\n- (3,9): |2-3| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (4,6): |2-4| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, after eating (2,9), the closest apple is at (3,9), just one move away.\n\nFrom (2,9), I can move right to (3,9) to eat that apple.\n\nThen, the next closest apples are at (4,6) and (7,8).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (3,9):\n\n- (4,6): |3-4| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (7,8): |3-7| + |9-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,2): |3-6| + |9-2| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6), distance 4.\n\nFrom (3,9) to (4,6):\n\n- Move right once to (4,9)\n\n- Move down three times to (4,6)\n\nThat's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,9) to (7,8):\n\n- Move right four times to (7,9)\n\n- Move down once to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going for (4,6) is quicker.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), I can then consider going for (7,8) or (6,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |6-8| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- To (6,2): |4-6| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, (7,8) is closer.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (7,8):\n\n- Move right three times to (7,6)\n\n- Move up two times to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (7,8) to (6,2):\n\n- Move left once to (6,8)\n\n- Move down six times to (6,2)\n\nThat's seven moves.\n\nSo, total moves:\n\n- To (2,9): 4 moves\n\n- To (3,9): 1 move\n\n- To (4,6): 4 moves\n\n- To (7,8): 5 moves\n\n- To (6,2): 7 moves\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 21 moves to eat all apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into other snakes or my own tail in the process.\n\nAlso, Snake #1 is at (2,0), and it might be growing or moving upwards to reach apples.\n\nI need to be cautious not to collide with it.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path:\n\n(0,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,9) -> (3,9) -> (4,9) -> (4,6) -> (7,6) -> (7,8) -> (6,8) -> (6,2)\n\nThat seems like a possible sequence.\n\nBut maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,7), I could go directly to (4,6), which is closer than (2,9).\n\nLet's calculate the distance to (4,6):\n\n|0-4| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nCompared to (2,9) which is 4 moves.\n\nSo, (2,9) is closer.\n\nBut let's see the sequence if I go to (4,6) first.\n\nFrom (0,7) to (4,6):\n\n- Right four times to (4,7)\n\n- Down once to (4,6)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, to (2,9):\n\n- Left two times to (2,6)\n\n- Up three times to (2,9)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, to (3,9):\n\n- Right once to (3,9)\n\n- And so on.\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 5 + ... It might end up being similar or more moves.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial plan of going to (2,9) first seems better.\n\nAlso, considering that (2,9) is closer, and after eating it, I can quickly go to (3,9), which is right next to it.\n\nThen, proceed to (4,6), then (7,8), and finally (6,2).\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this path, I'm moving in a way that should avoid that, as I'm moving in straight lines and the board is large enough.\n\nAlright, so my immediate move should be to start moving right towards (2,7), then up to (2,9).\n\nBut,"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,6). The apples are located at (2,9), (7,8), (6,2), (3,9), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at position (1,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (0,6), which is on the bottom row, seventh cell from the left. There's another snake at (1,0), which is just below me, on the very bottom row, second cell from the left.\n\nApples are scattered around:\n\n- (2,9): that's towards the top, third row from the top, tenth cell from the left.\n\n- (7,8): towards the top, eighth row from the bottom, ninth cell from the left.\n\n- (6,2): towards the bottom, seventh row from the top, third cell from the left.\n\n- (3,9): towards the top, fourth row from the top, tenth cell from the left.\n\n- (4,6): towards the middle, fifth row from the top, seventh cell from the left.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the closest apple. Let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- To (2,9): |0-2| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- To (7,8): |0-7| + |6-8| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n- To (6,2): |0-6| + |6-2| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- To (3,9): |0-3| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (4,6): |0-4| + |6-6| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just four moves away. Let's see if that's a feasible path.\n\nFrom (0,6) to (4,6): I need to move right four times. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 6: 9 . . A A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (0,6), moving right to (4,6):\n\n- (0,6) to (1,6): clear\n\n- (1,6) to (2,6): clear\n\n- (2,6) to (3,6): clear\n\n- (3,6) to (4,6): apple!\n\nLooks good. No obstacles in the way. So, I can safely move right four times to eat the apple at (4,6).\n\nBut, I should think ahead. After eating that apple, I'll grow in length, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail in the process.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are better apples to go for that might set me up for eating more apples in sequence.\n\nLet me look at the board again. After eating (4,6), I could potentially go up to (4,9) to eat (3,9) or (2,9), but that seems a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going towards (2,9), but that's a bit further away, and I'd have to navigate around any potential obstacles.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (2,9), and (3,9), and (7,8), and (6,2).\n\nI need to think about the order in which to eat the apples to maximize the number I can eat before having to worry about running into walls or other snakes.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (4,6): closest, 4 moves right.\n\n- After eating (4,6), I can continue right to (7,6), but there are no apples there.\n\n- Or, I can go up to (4,9), but that's a few moves up, and there are no apples directly in that path.\n\nWait, (3,9) is at (3,9), which is up and left from (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6) to (3,9):\n\n- Left once to (3,6)\n\n- Up three times to (3,9)\n\nThat's a total of four moves after eating (4,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that in the process, I don't run into my own tail or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), I could go right to (7,6), but there are no apples there. Then up to (7,8), which has an apple.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (7,6):\n\n- Right three times to (7,6)\n\n- Then up two times to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves in total after eating (4,6).\n\nSo, total moves from current position:\n\n- To (4,6): 4 moves right\n\n- To (7,6): 3 moves right\n\n- To (7,8): 2 moves up\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 moves\n\nBut, I need to make sure that in these moves, I don't run into anything.\n\nAlso, considering the other apple at (6,2), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (7,8), I could potentially go down to (7,2), then left to (6,2), but that's a long path and might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), I could go down to (4,2), then right to (6,2), but that's also a few moves.\n\nI need to prioritize the closest apples and think about the path that allows me to eat the most apples with the least moves.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (1,6)\n\n2. Move right to (2,6)\n\n3. Move right to (3,6)\n\n4. Move right to (4,6) - eat apple, grow\n\n5. Move right to (5,6)\n\n6. Move right to (6,6)\n\n7. Move right to (7,6)\n\n8. Move up to (7,7)\n\n9. Move up to (7,8) - eat apple, grow\n\nAfter eating the second apple, I can consider where to go next.\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown by two segments.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into my own tail or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, snake #1 is at (1,0), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movement, but for now, it's at (1,0), which is below me.\n\nAs I move up towards the apples, it might move up as well, so I need to be cautious not to run into it.\n\nBut for the immediate moves, it should be safe.\n\nSo, sticking with the plan:\n\nMove right to (1,6)\n\nThen right to (2,6)\n\nThen right to (3,6)\n\nThen right to (4,6) - eat apple\n\nThen right to (5,6)\n\nThen right to (6,6)\n\nThen right to (7,6)\n\nThen up to (7,7)\n\nThen up to (7,8) - eat apple\n\nThat's a total of 9 moves.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going to (6,2), which is down and to the left.\n\nFrom (7,8), I would need to move down to (7,7), then (7,6), then (7,5), and so on, down to (7,2), then left to (6,2).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail in the process.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,8), I could go left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) - eat apple.\n\nThat's seven moves from (7,8) to (6,2).\n\nTotal moves so far: 9 (to (7,8)) + 7 = 16 moves.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can consider going to (2,9) or (3,9).\n\n(2,9) is up and left from (6,2).\n\nFrom (6,2), up to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), ("

So, I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a straight line and the board is relatively empty, I should be fine.\n\nHowever, there are other apples on the board, and I need to think about a sequence that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the other apples after I eat (2,9):\n\n- (7,8): now at a distance of |2-7| + |9-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,2): |2-6| + |9-2| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\n- (3,9): |2-3| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (4,6): |2-4| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, after eating (2,9), the closest apple is at (3,9), just one move away.\n\nFrom (2,9), I can move right to (3,9) to eat that apple.\n\nThen, the next closest apples are at (4,6) and (7,8).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (3,9):\n\n- (4,6): |3-4| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (7,8): |3-7| + |9-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,2): |3-6| + |9-2| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6), distance 4.\n\nFrom (3,9) to (4,6):\n\n- Move right once to (4,9)\n\n- Move down three times to (4,6)\n\nThat's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,9) to (7,8):\n\n- Move right four times to (7,9)\n\n- Move down once to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going for (4,6) is quicker.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), I can then consider going for (7,8) or (6,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |6-8| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- To (6,2): |4-6| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, (7,8) is closer.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (7,8):\n\n- Move right three times to (7,6)\n\n- Move up two times to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (7,8) to (6,2):\n\n- Move left once to (6,8)\n\n- Move down six times to (6,2)\n\nThat's seven moves.\n\nSo, total moves:\n\n- To (2,9): 4 moves\n\n- To (3,9): 1 move\n\n- To (4,6): 4 moves\n\n- To (7,8): 5 moves\n\n- To (6,2): 7 moves\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 21 moves to eat all apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into other snakes or my own tail in the process.\n\nAlso, Snake #1 is at (2,0), and it might be growing or moving upwards to reach apples.\n\nI need to be cautious not to collide with it.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path:\n\n(0,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,9) -> (3,9) -> (4,9) -> (4,6) -> (7,6) -> (7,8) -> (6,8) -> (6,2)\n\nThat seems like a possible sequence.\n\nBut maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,7), I could go directly to (4,6), which is closer than (2,9).\n\nLet's calculate the distance to (4,6):\n\n|0-4| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nCompared to (2,9) which is 4 moves.\n\nSo, (2,9) is closer.\n\nBut let's see the sequence if I go to (4,6) first.\n\nFrom (0,7) to (4,6):\n\n- Right four times to (4,7)\n\n- Down once to (4,6)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, to (2,9):\n\n- Left two times to (2,6)\n\n- Up three times to (2,9)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, to (3,9):\n\n- Right once to (3,9)\n\n- And so on.\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 5 + ... It might end up being similar or more moves.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial plan of going to (2,9) first seems better.\n\nAlso, considering that (2,9) is closer, and after eating it, I can quickly go to (3,9), which is right next to it.\n\nThen, proceed to (4,6), then (7,8), and finally (6,2).\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this path, I'm moving in a way that should avoid that, as I'm moving in straight lines and the board is large enough.\n\nAlright, so my immediate move should be to start moving right towards (2,7), then up to (2,9).\n\nBut,"

Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, I'm controlling Snake number 2, and currently, I'm at position (0,7). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the positions of the apples and other snakes.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,9)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (3,9)\n\n- (4,6)\n\nThere's another snake, Snake #1, at position (2,0), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's probably just started.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . A A . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 7: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . .

A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nSo, I'm at row 7, column 0, which is position (0,7).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. To do that, I should calculate the distance to each apple and see which one is closest.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance for each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (2,9):\n\n- Distance = |0-2| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (7,8):\n\n- Distance = |0-7| + |7-8| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Distance = |0-6| + |7-2| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n4. Apple at (3,9):\n\n- Distance = |0-3| + |7-9| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Distance = |0-4| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,9) with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to plan the path to (2,9). From (0,7), I need to move right to increase my x-coordinate to 2 and up to increase my y-coordinate to 9.\n\nLet's see the path:\n\n- From (0,7) to (1,7): clear\n\n- From (1,7) to (2,7): clear\n\n- From (2,7) to (2,8): clear\n\n- From (2,8) to (2,9): apple!\n\nLooks good. No obstacles in the way.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,9), I'll grow in length by one segment. So, I need to make sure I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a straight line and the board is relatively empty, I should be fine.\n\nHowever, there are other apples on the board, and I need to think about a sequence that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the other apples after I eat (2,9):\n\n- (7,8): |2-7| + |9-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,2): |2-6| + |9-2| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\n- (3,9): |2-3| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (4,6): |2-4| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, after eating (2,9), the closest apple is at (3,9), just one move away.\n\nFrom (2,9), I can move right to (3,9) to eat that apple.\n\nThen, the next closest apples are at (4,6) and (7,8).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (3,9):\n\n- To (4,6): |3-4| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (7,8): |3-7| + |9-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (6,2): |3-6| + |9-2| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nFrom (3,9) to (4,6):\n\n- Move right once to (4,9)\n\n- Move down three times to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves in total.\n\nThen, from (4,6) to (7,8):\n\n- Move right three times to (7,6)\n\n- Move up two times to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nAfter that, to (6,2):\n\n- Move left once to (6,8)\n\n- Move down six times to (6,2)\n\nThat's seven moves.\n\nSo, the total moves would be:\n\n- To (2,9): 4 moves\n\n- To (3,9): 1 move\n\n- To (4,6): 4 moves\n\n- To (7,8): 5 moves\n\n- To (6,2): 7 moves\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 21 moves to eat all apples.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (2,0). It might be moving upwards to reach apples as well.\n\nI should try to reach the apples before Snake #1 can get to them.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize apples that are closer to me and farther from Snake #1.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (2,9): close to me, far from Snake #1\n\n- (3,9): close to me, far from Snake #1\n\n- (4,6): somewhat close, Snake #1 would have to move up 6 and right 4 to get there, which is 10 moves.\n\n- (7,8): farther away, Snake #1 would have to move up 8 and right 5 to get there, which is 13 moves.\n\n- (6,2): far, Snake #1 would have to move up 2 and right 4, which is 6 moves.\n\nWait, (6,2) is actually closer to Snake #1 than to me.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider eating (6,2) earlier to prevent Snake #1 from getting to it.\n\nBut that's a bit far, and it would take many moves to get there.\n\nAlternatively, I can focus on eating the closer apples first and then deal with (6,2).\n\nAlso, considering the time, maybe I should just stick with my initial plan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating (4,6) next after (2,9) and (3,9), as it's closer and blocks Snake #1 from getting to it.\n\nThen, proceed to (7,8) and finally (6,2).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't let Snake #1 eat any apples while I'm focusing on one.\n\nBut given that Snake #1 is at (2,0), and I'm at (0,7), I should be able to reach (2,9) before it, assuming it has to move up 9 steps to get there.\n\nWait, no: Snake #1 is at (2,0), to reach (2,9), it needs to move up 9 times.\n\nFrom my position (0,7), to (2,9), it's 2 rights and 2 ups, totaling 4 moves.\n\nSnake #1 would need 9 ups to reach (2,9), which is more than my 4 moves.\n\nSo, I can reach (2,9) before Snake #1.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,9), I can reach it in 1 additional move from (2,9), while Snake #1 would need to move right once and up 9 times, which is 10 moves.\n\nSo, I'm still faster.\n\nFor (4,6), from my position at (3,9), it's 1 right and 3 downs, totaling 4 moves.\n\nSnake #1 would need to move right 4 times and up 6 times, totaling 10 moves.\n\nAgain, I'm faster.\n\nFor (7,8), from (4,6), it's 3 rights and 2 ups, totaling 5 moves.\n\nSnake #1 would need to move right 7 times and up 8 times, totaling 15 moves.\n\nStill, I'm faster.\n\nFor (6,2), from (7,8), it's 1 left and 6 downs, totaling 7 moves.\n\nSnake #1 would need to move right 4 times and up 2 times, totaling 6 moves.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can reach (6,2) in 6 moves, while I need 7 moves from (7,8).\n\nThat means Snake #1 might reach ("

The apples are located at (2,9), (7,8), (6,2), (3,9), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at position (1,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are towards the top, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (0,6), which is on the bottom row, seventh cell from the left. There's another snake at (1,0), which is just below me, on the very bottom row, second cell from the left.\n\nApples are scattered around:\n\n- (2,9): that's towards the top, third row from the top, tenth cell from the left.\n\n- (7,8): towards the top, eighth row from the bottom, ninth cell from the left.\n\n- (6,2): towards the bottom, seventh row from the top, third cell from the left.\n\n- (3,9): towards the top, fourth row from the top, tenth cell from the left.\n\n- (4,6): towards the middle, fifth row from the top, seventh cell from the left.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the closest apple. Let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- To (2,9): |0-2| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- To (7,8): |0-7| + |6-8| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n- To (6,2): |0-6| + |6-2| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- To (3,9): |0-3| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (4,6): |0-4| + |6-6| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just four moves away. Let's see if that's a feasible path.\n\nFrom (0,6) to (4,6): I need to move right four times. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 6: 9 . . A A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (0,6), moving right to (4,6):\n\n- (0,6) to (1,6): clear\n\n- (1,6) to (2,6): clear\n\n- (2,6) to (3,6): clear\n\n- (3,6) to (4,6): apple!\n\nLooks good. No obstacles in the way. So, I can safely move right four times to eat the apple at (4,6).\n\nBut, I should think ahead. After eating that apple, I'll grow in length, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail in the process.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are better apples to go for that might set me up for eating more apples in sequence.\n\nLet me look at the board again. After eating (4,6), I could potentially go up to (4,9) to eat (3,9) or (2,9), but that seems a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going towards (2,9), but that's a bit further away, and I'd have to navigate around any potential obstacles.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (2,9), and (3,9), and (7,8), and (6,2).\n\nI need to think about the order in which to eat the apples to maximize the number I can eat before having to worry about running into walls or other snakes.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (4,6): closest, 4 moves right.\n\n- After eating (4,6), I can continue right to (7,6), but there are no apples there.\n\n- Or, I can go up to (4,9), but that's a few moves up, and there are no apples directly in that path.\n\nWait, (3,9) is at (3,9), which is up and left from (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6) to (3,9):\n\n- Left once to (3,6)\n\n- Up three times to (3,9)\n\nThat's a total of four moves after eating (4,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that in the process, I don't run into my own tail or other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), I could go right to (7,6), but there are no apples there. Then up to (7,8), which has an apple.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (7,6):\n\n- Right three times to (7,6)\n\n- Then up two times to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves in total after eating (4,6).\n\nSo, total moves from current position:\n\n- To (4,6): 4 moves right\n\n- To (7,6): 3 moves right\n\n- To (7,8): 2 moves up\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 moves\n\nBut, I need to make sure that in these moves, I don't run into anything.\n\nAlso, considering the other apple at (6,2), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (7,8), I could potentially go down to (7,2), then left to (6,2), but that's a long path and might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), I could go down to (4,2), then right to (6,2), but that's also a few moves.\n\nI need to prioritize the closest apples and think about the path that allows me to eat the most apples with the least moves.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (1,6)\n\n2. Move right to (2,6)\n\n3. Move right to (3,6)\n\n4. Move right to (4,6) - eat apple, grow\n\n5. Move right to (5,6)\n\n6. Move right to (6,6)\n\n7. Move right to (7,6)\n\n8. Move up to (7,7)\n\n9. Move up to (7,8) - eat apple, grow\n\nAfter eating the second apple, I can consider where to go next.\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown by two segments.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into my own tail or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, snake #1 is at (1,0), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movement, but for now, it's at (1,0), which is below me.\n\nAs I move up towards the apples, it might move up as well, so I need to be cautious not to run into it.\n\nBut for the immediate moves, it should be safe.\n\nSo, sticking with the plan:\n\nMove right to (1,6)\n\nThen right to (2,6)\n\nThen right to (3,6)\n\nThen right to (4,6) - eat apple\n\nThen right to (5,6)\n\nThen right to (6,6)\n\nThen right to (7,6)\n\nThen up to (7,7)\n\nThen up to (7,8) - eat apple\n\nThat's a total of 9 moves.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going to (6,2), which is down and to the left.\n\nFrom (7,8), I would need to move down to (7,7), then (7,6), then (7,5), and so on, down to (7,2), then left to (6,2).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail in the process.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,8), I could go left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) - eat apple.\n\nThat's seven moves from (7,8) to (6,2).\n\nTotal moves so far: 9 (to (7,8)) + 7 = 16 moves.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can consider going to (2,9) or (3,9).\n\n(2,9) is up and left from (6,2).\n\nFrom (6,2), up to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), ("

Also, there's another snake, Snake #1, at position (2,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed yet, so maybe it's just started or is very small.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. From the board state provided:\n\n- Row 9: . . A A . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\n- Row 7: 2 . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nSo, apples are at rows 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nMy snake is at (0,7), which is on row 7, column 0.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. To do that, I should calculate the distance to each apple and see which one is closest.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance for each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (2,9):\n\n- Distance = |0-2| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (7,8):\n\n- Distance = |0-7| + |7-8| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Distance = |0-6| + |7-2| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n4. Apple at (3,9):\n\n- Distance = |0-3| + |7-9| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Distance = |0-4| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,9) with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to plan the path to (2,9). From (0,7), I need to move right to increase my x-coordinate to 2 and up to increase my y-coordinate to 9.\n\nBut wait, in this game, increasing y-coordinate is moving up, and increasing x-coordinate is moving right.\n\nSo, from (0,7), to reach (2,9):\n\n- Move right twice (to x=2)\n\n- Move up two times (to y=9)\n\nThat seems straightforward. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (0,7) to (1,7): clear\n\n- From (1,7) to (2,7): clear\n\n- From (2,7) to (2,8): clear\n\n- From (2,8) to (2,9): apple!\n\nSo, the path seems clear. No other snakes or walls in the way.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (2,9), I will grow in length by one segment. So, I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a straight line and the board is relatively empty, I should be fine.\n\nHowever, there are other apples on the board, and I need to think about a sequence that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the other apples after I eat (2,9):\n\n- (7,8): now at a distance of |2-7| + |9-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (6,2): |2-6| + |9-2| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\n- (3,9): |2-3| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (4,6): |2-4| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, after eating (2,9), the closest apple is at (3,9), just one move away.\n\nFrom (2,9), I can move right to (3,9) to eat that apple.\n\nThen, the next closest apples are at (4,6) and (7,8).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (3,9):\n\n- (4,6): |3-4| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (7,8): |3-7| + |9-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,2): |3-6| + |9-2| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6), distance 4.\n\nFrom (3,9) to (4,6):\n\n- Move right once to (4,9)\n\n- Move down three times to (4,6)\n\nThat's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,9) to (7,8):\n\n- Move right four times to (7,9)\n\n- Move down once to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going for (4,6) is quicker.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), I can then consider going for (7,8) or (6,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |6-8| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- To (6,2): |4-6| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, (7,8) is closer.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (7,8):\n\n- Move right three times to (7,6)\n\n- Move up two times to (7,8)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (7,8) to (6,2):\n\n- Move left once to (6,8)\n\n- Move down six times to (6,2)\n\nThat's seven moves.\n\nSo, total moves:\n\n- To (2,9): 4 moves\n\n- To (3,9): 1 move\n\n- To (4,6): 4 moves\n\n- To (7,8): 5 moves\n\n- To (6,2): 7 moves\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 21 moves to eat all apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into other snakes or my own tail in the process.\n\nAlso, Snake #1 is at (2,0), and it might be growing or moving upwards to reach apples.\n\nI need to be cautious not to collide with it.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path:\n\n(0,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,9) -> (3,9) -> (4,9) -> (4,6) -> (7,6) -> (7,8) -> (6,8) -> (6,2)\n\nThat seems like a possible sequence.\n\nBut maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,7), I could go directly to (4,6), which is closer than (2,9).\n\nLet's calculate the distance to (4,6):\n\n|0-4| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nCompared to (2,9) which is 4 moves.\n\nSo, (2,9) is closer.\n\nBut let's see the sequence if I go to (4,6) first.\n\nFrom (0,7) to (4,6):\n\n- Right four times to (4,7)\n\n- Down once to (4,6)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, to (2,9):\n\n- Left two times to (2,6)\n\n- Up three times to (2,9)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, to (3,9):\n\n- Right once to (3,9)\n\n- And so on.\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 5 + ... It might end up being similar or more moves.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial plan of going to (2,9) first seems better.\n\nAlso, considering that (2,9) is closer, and after eating it, I can quickly go to (3,9), which is right next to it.\n\nThen, proceed to (4,6), then (7,8), and finally (6,2).\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this path, I'm moving in a way that should avoid that, as I'm moving in straight lines and the board is large enough.\n\nAlright, so my immediate move should be to start moving right towards (2,7), then up to (2,9).\n\nBut,"
