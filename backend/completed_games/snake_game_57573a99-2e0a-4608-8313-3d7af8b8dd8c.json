Dovetail approximate heuristic in random slopes west-cutting yields max turnover high yields nearest clear straying. Proceed angle redundancy angling minimised exhaustion if movement ponds strategic points. On closure per turn-consuming equated accelerating within primary routes.\n\n**Next Move**:\nMoving diagonally to reach another nearest apple with calculative moves avoiding immediate red circumstantial death zones.\nHence calculated diagonal UP-RIGHT.\n\nNext turn I will adjust accordingly looking North based on transient ell square moves able heist pathways with smaller ticks ensuring directly visual tracked paths.\n\nDecided Next Move: UP RIGHT"
