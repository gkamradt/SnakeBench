My goal is to eat apples, grow, and avoid hazards like the wall, other snakes, or running into myself.\n\nI've identified these apples on the board:\n\n1. (7, 9)\n2. (9, 9)\n3. (8, 6)\n4. (6, 4)\n5. (4, 3)\n\nHere's my rough plan:\n\n- Immediately, I notice that there's an apple directly to my right at (6,4). This is likely the most accessible apple since there's no obstacle between my current location and that apple.\n  \n- The enemy snake (Snake #2) is currently at (5, 8). Fortunately, it's nowhere near the path between me and the (6, 4) apple, so I don't have to be overly concerned with them for now.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at potential moves from my current position at (0, 4):\n\n- **UP** to (0, 5): This doesn't immediately get me closer to an apple and deviates away from my desired path.\n- **DOWN** to (0, 3): I'd need to go back up or right eventually, and it also leads away from (6,4).\n- **LEFT** to (-1, 4): This is a wall boundary which results in death.\n- **RIGHT** to (1, 4): This is the move that brings me closer to the apple at (6, 4).\n\nGiven these options, the most strategic move is **RIGHT** towards the (6, 4) apple. \n\nMy plan is to continue moving toward this apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements and avoiding any walls or hazards. \n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

There is also an enemy snake at position (0, 4).\n\nGiven the position of the apples, it seems that the best strategy would be to move the snake towards the apples located at (7, 9) and (9, 9). These apples are closest to the snake's current position, and collecting them would allow the snake to grow and gain points.\n\nHowever, we need to be cautious of the enemy snake, as it could pose a threat if we're not careful. Additionally, we need to ensure that we don't run into the walls or the snake's own body, as that would result in death.\n\nKeeping these factors in mind, I think the best move for the snake is to go RIGHT. This will allow it to move towards the apples at (7, 9) and (9, 9), while also keeping some distance from the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn would be to continue moving towards the apples, while also keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position and avoiding any potential collisions.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

My ultimate goal is still to get to the apple at (6, 4) while avoiding any potential hazards like the walls, myself, and the other snake (Snake #2).\n\nLet's revisit the positions of key elements:\n- My position: (1, 4)\n- Apples: (7, 9), (9, 9), (8, 6), (6, 4), (4, 3)\n- Enemy Snake #2: Located at (6, 8) currently, with no body parts on the board.\n\nThe apple at (6, 4) is still my primary target due to its proximity. Here's a step-by-step evaluation of my possible moves:\n\n1. **UP** to (1, 5): This move won't get me closer to the (6, 4) apple and deviates me from my target path.\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 3): This also moves me away from (6, 4), and I would need to realign my path.\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 4): Moving backward is not an option since it provides no advantage and wastes a move.\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 4): This continues my pursuit of the apple at (6, 4) and progresses me in the correct direction.\n\nGiven my current position and the available options, the clear strategic choice is to continue moving **RIGHT** toward the apple at (6, 4). This keeps me on track with my plan and maximizes efficiency.\n\nFor the next few moves, I need to maintain focus on unobstructed paths to the apple at (6, 4) while being vigilant of any sudden changes or movements by Snake #2.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep moving right towards the goal of reaching (6, 4), monitor the other snake's position in case it poses a threat, and stay aware of potential obstacles like walls or future strategic repositioning for other apples.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
