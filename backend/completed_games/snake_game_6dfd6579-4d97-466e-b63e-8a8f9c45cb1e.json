My current position at (1,9) allows me some flexibility, but I need to watch out for the enemy snake, especially since it's currently moving around its body situated at the (5, 4), (4, 4), and (4, 5) positions. My short-term strategy is to identify where the apples are located, and which of those I can reach without immediately putting myself at risk.\n\nConsidering the apples at (5, 1), (2, 3), (6, 5), (0, 2), and (2, 5), I want to prioritize ones that are either close or those that align with a path that can grow my snake without significant obstacles. Moving towards (2, 3) doesn't seem optimal given the presence of the enemy snake. The apple at (0, 2) is tempting due to its proximity, but moving directly towards it could lead me to an unsafe position near the enemy. The apple at (2, 5) also shares a column with the enemy which could expose me.\n\nTherefore, the apple at (5, 1) and (6, 5) could be potential targets since they are not adjacent to the enemy and can be accessed relatively easily. However, aiming for the top corner (5, 1) apple, I consider moving up, as this can position me for further ascension which may reduce confrontation with the enemy.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
