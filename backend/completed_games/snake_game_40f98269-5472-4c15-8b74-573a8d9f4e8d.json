This implies a slight inconsistency in the narrative regarding my exact last position, but based on the current descriptions and rules, my current head position as (1, 4) is accurate. Taking a LEFT move would indeed take me out of bounds as indicated by the board drawing, so I need to reassess.\n\nFrom my current position (1, 4):\n1. Moving LEFT is not feasible - it would go out of the playing field, resulting in a loss.\n2. Moving RIGHT would position me to (2, 4), which is away from immediate apples but keeps options open for future moves.\n3.

Moving DOWN would bring me to (1, 3), directly on the position of an apple, securing a point and growth.\n\nGiven the vicinity to the apple and maintaining growth, the best move right now is DOWN to collect the apple at (1, 3), which helps me grow and possibly prepare for subsequent moves towards other apples on the board.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\nAfter moving DOWN and consuming the apple at (1, 3), assess the new position and possibly move to gather more apples towards the center or the right of the board.
