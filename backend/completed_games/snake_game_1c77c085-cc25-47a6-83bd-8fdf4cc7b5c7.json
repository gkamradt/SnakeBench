The apple at (1, 7) is in the upper left corner of the board, so I need to move up and left to reach it. However, moving left immediately would put me in the path of the enemy snake.\n\nA safer approach would be to move up first, away from the enemy snake's current position, and then left towards the apple. This would also position me to potentially collect the apple at (1, 7) and then move down to collect the apple at (5, 1) again if it respawns, as apples often do in Snake games after being collected.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be upwards to start moving towards the apple at (1, 7) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. After moving up, I will be at (3, 2), and I can continue to move up until I am past the enemy snake's current y-coordinate, then I can start moving left towards the apple.\n\nNext move: UP"
