The enemy snake is at (7, 7), which means it's still above me, while the apples on the board remain at (2, 5), (5, 5), (6, 3), (4, 4), and (8, 1). \n\n### Possible Moves from (7, 5):\n1. **UP** to (7, 6): This position is empty.\n2. **DOWN** to (7, 4): This position would take me back, which is not advisable.\n3. **LEFT** to (6, 5): This position is empty and does not provide immediate gains.\n4. **RIGHT** to (8, 5): This position is also empty and doesn't lead to apples.\n\n### Evaluating the Moves:\n- **UP** to (7, 6): This move doesn't threaten my safety or growth but does not yield any apples.\n- **DOWN** to (7, 4): Moving back is not a productive option.\n- **LEFT** to (6, 5): Also does not lead to immediate action.\n- **RIGHT** to (8, 5): Similar to the others, it is simply empty.\n\nNone of these moves provide an immediate advantage or lead to an apple collection. The immediate threat of the enemy snake being one space above me influences my decision as well.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince none of the moves allow for immediate apple collection, positioning is crucial. I need to evade potential confrontation with the enemy snake while keeping the possibility open for future apple collections. The movement UP leaves me near the enemy and potentially boxed in if they move down next. \n\nGiven that, the best tactical move would be to **move UP** to (7, 6) to maintain mobility and keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s next move, even if it doesn't provide immediate benefits.\n\n### Summary of Strategy:\n- Maintain distance from the enemy snake and avoid unnecessary confrontation. \n- Position myself to either evade or prepare for future apple collections.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP."

This will allow me to grow and gain a point while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. After grabbing that apple, I can reassess my options and possibly continue towards the cluster of apples around (5, 5) or move back towards the center of the board for more flexibility.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n1. After moving LEFT, evaluate the enemy snake's position and the remaining apples.\n2. If safe, continue towards the apples at (5, 5) and (4, 4).\n3.

It is still a safe distance away, but I must remain cautious and avoid getting trapped or cut off by its movements.\n\nOnce I reach the apple at (0, 7), I will have more room to maneuver and can decide whether to prioritize the apple at (2, 5) or (6, 3) based on the enemy snake's actions.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n1. Move LEFT to reach the apple at (0, 7).\n2. After consuming the apple, evaluate the board state and the enemy snake's position.\n3. Determine the safest path to either the apple at (2, 5) or (6, 3), depending on the enemy snake's movements.\n4. Continue to prioritize collecting apples while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake and walls.\n5. Keep adapting my strategy based on the changing game dynamics.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
