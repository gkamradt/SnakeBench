However, I need to be careful not to run into the wall or another snake.\n\nI see that I'm currently at (6, 9), and if I move up, I'll be at (6, 8). That's a safe move, but I need to keep an eye on the enemy snake #2, which is at (8, 6). I don't see any part of its body on the board, but it's still a potential threat.\n\nIf I move up again, I'll be at (6, 7). That's still a safe move, but I need to think about my long-term strategy. I want to reach the apple at (1, 6), but I also need to consider the other apples on the board.\n\nI see that there's an apple at (1, 6) which is relatively close. If I move up, I might be able to reach that apple. However, I also need to consider the other apples on the board, such as the one at (1, 2) which is on the same column as my current position.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to reach the apple at (1, 6) by moving up. I'll need to be careful not to run into the wall or another snake.\n\nNext move: UP."
