There are apples at (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), and (1,0). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (7,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, nothing there.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (4,5), dots, dots, enemy snake at (7,5), dots, dots.\n\nRow 4: all dots.\n\nRow 3: dots, dots, apple at (2,3), dots, dots, dots, apple at (6,3), dots, dots, dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: dots, apple at (1,0), my snake at (2,0), dots, dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (8,0), dots.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,0), and there are apples at (1,0), (2,3), (4,5), (6,3), and (8,0). The enemy snake is at (7,5).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (2,0) to each apple:\n\n- (1,0): distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,0), just one step to the left.\n\nBut I should also consider whether going for that apple might put me in harm's way with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,5), which is quite far from my current position. Also, it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nMoreover, after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that the path to the next apple is navigable with the increased length.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Go left to (1,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (1,0): that's LEFT.\n\nAfter eating this apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without colliding with my own body.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake will be at (1,0), and its tail will be at (2,0).\n\nNext, I can consider moving up to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3) to reach (2,3), but I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is far away. Maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going right to (3,0), but there's no apple there, and it might not be the most efficient path.\n\nOption 2: Go up to (2,1), then (2,2), then (2,3) to eat the apple at (2,3).\n\nThat's another option. Let's see:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1): UP.\n\nThen (2,1) to (2,2): UP.\n\nThen (2,2) to (2,3): UP.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have space to maneuver.\n\nBut, going up from (2,3), what's next? There are apples at (4,5), (6,3), and (8,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to reach (4,5), I need to go right to (3,3), then (4,3), then up to (4,4), then (4,5).\n\nThat seems a bit far, and I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could go right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nBut again, that's a longer path, and I need to watch out for the enemy snake at (7,5).\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is at column 7, row 5.\n\nIf I go to (6,3), that's towards the center of the board.\n\nI need to consider the possible movements of the enemy snake. Since it's just the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (4,5) directly.\n\nFrom (2,0), to (4,5), that's a Manhattan distance of 7 steps.\n\nThat seems a bit far, and I might expose myself to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0), which is at (8,0), a distance of 6 steps to the right.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (8,0): RIGHT six times.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that I can navigate without hitting my own body.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is at column 7, row 5.\n\nIf I go to (8,0), I might get closer to the enemy snake, depending on its movements.\n\nI need to balance between eating apples quickly and avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe a better strategy is to eat the closest apples first, gaining points and growing my snake, while staying away from the enemy snake.\n\nSo, starting with the apple at (1,0), which is right next to me.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (1,0): LEFT.\n\nAfter eating it, I move to (1,0), and my tail is at (2,0).\n\nNext, I can move up to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3) to eat the apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can then decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me map this path:\n\n(1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3)\n\nAt (2,3), I can then consider moving right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (2,4), then (2,5), then (3,5), then (4,5) to eat the apple at (4,5).\n\nBut, the apple at (6,3) is closer in Manhattan distance from (2,3):\n\nFrom (2,3) to (6,3): |2-6| + |3-3| = 4 steps to the right.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (4,5): |2-4| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps (right twice, up twice).\n\nSo, both apples are equally distant from (2,3).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first.\n\nConsidering the position of the enemy snake at (7,5), going to (4,5) might bring me closer to it, whereas going to (6,3) is also somewhat towards the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (2,3), I could consider going for the apple at (8,0), which is at (8,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to (8,0): need to go down to (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), then right to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to stick with the closer apples.\n\nSo, let's stick with the initial plan:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0)\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), I can then decide to go for the apple at (6,3) or (4"

So, if I move LEFT from (2,0) to (1,0), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in the last move, I chose to go RIGHT, which would take me to (3,0), which is just dots. Maybe I need to think again.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position at (2,0):\n\n- (1,0): Manhattan distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is indeed at (1,0), just one step to the left.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. After eating it, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nFrom (2,0), if I go LEFT to (1,0), I eat the apple, and my tail will be at (2,0). Then, if I move UP to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), and so on, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in or run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,5), which is quite a distance away. Since it doesn't have any body parts, it's less threatening for now. But I still need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (2,3), which is directly above me. That would require me to move UP three times, to (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). After eating that apple, I would grow, and then I could consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut, considering the distances, going to (1,0) is only one step, whereas going to (2,3) is three steps. So, it's faster to go for (1,0).\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,0), I can plan my path to the next apple without getting too close to the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about potential paths:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple at (2,3)\n\nAfter eating (2,3), I can then consider moving to (6,3) or (4,5). Let's see:\n\nFrom (2,3):\n\n- To (6,3): RIGHT four times\n\n- To (4,5): RIGHT twice, UP two times\n\nBoth are equally distant, but going to (6,3) might bring me closer to the enemy snake at (6,5). So, perhaps going to (4,5) is better, as it's diagonally away.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (8,0), which is far to the right.\n\nFrom (2,3), to (8,0):\n\n- DOWN to (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)\n\nThat's a longer path, and again, going towards (6,0) might bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,3), going to (4,5) is a better choice.\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (2,3):\n\n1. UP to (2,1)\n\n2. UP to (2,2)\n\n3. UP to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\nThen, decide to go to (4,5):\n\n4. RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n6. UP to (4,4)\n\n7. UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThis seems feasible, but it's a longer path compared to going for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nConsidering that the enemy snake is at (6,5), and assuming it's not moving yet, I think it's safer to go for the closer apples first and gain points quickly.\n\nMoreover, by going for (1,0) first, I can start building my snake's length without exposing myself too much to the enemy.\n\nSo, perhaps the best strategy is:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), I can consider which apple to go for next, based on the enemy snake's position and my own snake's length.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0) after eating (1,0), but that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nRisk assessment:\n\n- Going for (1,0):\n\n- Immediate: low risk, just one step to the left.\n\n- After eating (1,0):\n\n- Moving up to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), then right to (2,3).\n\n- The enemy snake is at (6,5), which is far away, so low risk.\n\n- After eating (2,3):\n\n- Options to go to (4,5) or (6,3).\n\n- (4,5) is at (4,5), and (6,3) is at (6,3).\n\n- (4,5) is diagonally up and to the right, while (6,3) is directly to the right.\n\n- The enemy is at (6,5), so going to (6,3) might bring me closer to it.\n\n- Perhaps going to (4,5) first is better.\n\n- From (2,3) to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), UP to (4,4), (4,5).\n\n- That's four steps.\n\n- From (2,3) to (6,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).\n\n- Also four steps.\n\n- So, similar distance.\n\n- But (4,5) is closer to the center, whereas (6,3) is closer to the enemy.\n\n- Maybe (4,5) is safer.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\n6. RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n7. RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n8. UP to (4,4)\n\n9. UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the remaining apples at (6,3) and (8,0), depending on the enemy's position.\n\nBut this is getting too ahead. I should focus on the immediate next move.\n\nGiven that, I think the best first move is to go LEFT to (1,0) and eat that apple.\n\nHowever,"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). There are apples at (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), and (1,0). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (7,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, nothing there.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (4,5), dots, dots, enemy snake at (7,5), dots, dots.\n\nRow 4: all dots.\n\nRow 3: dots, dots, apple at (2,3), dots, dots, dots, apple at (6,3), dots, dots, dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: dots, apple at (1,0), my snake at (2,0), dots, dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (8,0), dots.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,0), and there are apples at (1,0), (2,3), (4,5), (6,3), and (8,0). The enemy snake is at (7,5).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (2,0) to each apple:\n\n- (1,0): distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,0), just one step to the left.\n\nBut I should also consider whether going for that apple might put me in harm's way with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,5), which is quite far from my current position. Also, it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nMoreover, after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that the path to the next apple is navigable with the increased length.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Go left to (1,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (1,0): that's LEFT.\n\nAfter eating this apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without colliding with my own body.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake will be at (1,0), and its tail will be at (2,0).\n\nNext, I can consider moving up to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3) to reach (2,3), but I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is far away. Maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going right to (3,0), but there's no apple there, and it might not be the most efficient path.\n\nOption 2: Go up to (2,1), then (2,2), then (2,3) to eat the apple at (2,3).\n\nThat's another option. Let's see:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1): UP.\n\nThen (2,1) to (2,2): UP.\n\nThen (2,2) to (2,3): UP.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have space to maneuver.\n\nBut, going up from (2,3), what's next? There are apples at (4,5), (6,3), and (8,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to reach (4,5), I need to go right to (3,3), then (4,3), then up to (4,4), then (4,5).\n\nThat seems a bit far, and I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could go right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nBut again, that's a longer path, and I need to watch out for the enemy snake at (7,5).\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is at column 7, row 5.\n\nIf I go to (6,3), that's towards the center of the board.\n\nI need to consider the possible movements of the enemy snake. Since it's just the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (4,5) directly.\n\nFrom (2,0), to (4,5), that's a Manhattan distance of 7 steps.\n\nThat seems a bit far, and I might expose myself to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0), which is at (8,0), a distance of 6 steps to the right.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (8,0): RIGHT six times.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that I can navigate without hitting my own body.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is at column 7, row 5.\n\nIf I go to (8,0), I might get closer to the enemy snake, depending on its movements.\n\nI need to balance between eating apples quickly and avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe a better strategy is to eat the closest apples first, gaining points and growing my snake, while staying away from the enemy snake.\n\nSo, starting with the apple at (1,0), which is right next to me.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (1,0): LEFT.\n\nAfter eating it, I move to (1,0), and my tail is at (2,0).\n\nNext, I can move up to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3) to eat the apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can then decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me map this path:\n\n(1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3)\n\nAt (2,3), I can then consider moving right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (2,4), then (2,5), then (3,5), then (4,5) to eat the apple at (4,5).\n\nBut, the apple at (6,3) is closer in Manhattan distance from (2,3):\n\nFrom (2,3) to (6,3): |2-6| + |3-3| = 4 steps to the right.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (4,5): |2-4| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps (right twice, up twice).\n\nSo, both apples are equally distant from (2,3).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first.\n\nConsidering the position of the enemy snake at (7,5), going to (4,5) might bring me closer to it, whereas going to (6,3) is also somewhat towards the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (2,3), I could consider going for the apple at (8,0), which is at (8,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to (8,0): need to go down to (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), then right to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to stick with the closer apples.\n\nSo, let's stick with the initial plan:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0)\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), I can then decide to go for the apple at (6,3) or (4"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and going up to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). In the board state, it shows me at (2,0), with apples at (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), and (1,0). There's an enemy snake at (6,5) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was to the RIGHT, but I think I need to reconsider that. Let me look at the distances to each apple from my current position at (2,0):\n\n- (1,0): Manhattan distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,0), just one step to the left. If I go LEFT to (1,0), I'll eat the apple and grow. After eating it, my tail will be at (2,0), and I need to make sure not to run into it.\n\nLet me think about my next moves after eating (1,0):\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple at (2,3)\n\nAfter eating (2,3), I can then consider moving to another apple. The enemy snake is at (6,5), which is a bit far, so for now, it's not a immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (2,3) directly:\n\n1. UP to (2,1)\n\n2. UP to (2,2)\n\n3. UP to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\nThen, decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut going for the closer apple at (1,0) first seems more efficient since it's only one step away, and I can gain a point quickly.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and then right to (2,3) to eat another apple.\n\nLet me visualize this path:\n\n- From (2,0):\n\n- LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple\n\n- Now, my tail is at (2,0)\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown. The enemy snake is still at (6,5), and I need to be cautious not to get too close.\n\nNext, I can consider going for the apple at (4,5). From (2,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThat seems manageable, and it keeps me away from the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (6,3), which is closer:\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3) - eat apple\n\nBut this brings me closer to the enemy at (6,5), which might not be ideal.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (4,5) is a better choice.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I can then consider going for the apple at (8,0):\n\n- RIGHT to (5,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - eat apple\n\nThat's a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake during this journey.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0) after eating (2,3), but that seems even longer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (8,0) earlier.\n\nFrom (2,3), the distance to (8,0) is:\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - total of 3 steps down\n\nThat's 6 + 3 = 9 steps, which is a long path.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThen, go to (6,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (5,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4), (6,3) - eat apple\n\nAfter that, go to (8,0):\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3), (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - eat apple\n\nThis seems like a longer game, and I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't interfering.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to focus on the closer apples first and gain points quickly.\n\nSo, my initial plan is:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\n6. RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n7. RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n8. UP to (4,4)\n\n9. UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide my next move, which is to go LEFT to (1,0) and eat that apple.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,0), I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my tail will be at (2,0). Then, if I move UP to (1,1), that's fine. Then to (1,2), then (1,3), and then RIGHT to (2,3).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider going for the apple at (2,3) directly without going to (1,0) first.\n\nLet me compare the two options:\n\nOption A: Go to (1,0) first\n\n- Pros: Closer apple, quicker point gain\n\n- Cons: Need to make several moves to reach another apple after that\n\nOption B: Go to (2,3) first\n\n- Pros: Direct path to another apple\n\n- Cons: Longer distance, delayed point gain\n\nI think Option A is better because it allows me to gain points faster and build my snake's length sooner.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to go LEFT to (1,0) and eat that apple.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{LEFT}} \\]"

There are apples at (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), and (1,0). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (7,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, nothing there.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (4,5), dots, dots, enemy snake at (7,5), dots, dots.\n\nRow 4: all dots.\n\nRow 3: dots, dots, apple at (2,3), dots, dots, dots, apple at (6,3), dots, dots, dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: dots, apple at (1,0), my snake at (2,0), dots, dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (8,0), dots.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,0), and there are apples at (1,0), (2,3), (4,5), (6,3), and (8,0). The enemy snake is at (7,5).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (2,0) to each apple:\n\n- (1,0): distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,0), just one step to the left.\n\nBut I should also consider whether going for that apple might put me in harm's way with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,5), which is quite far from my current position. Also, it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nMoreover, after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that the path to the next apple is navigable with the increased length.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Go left to (1,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (1,0): that's LEFT.\n\nAfter eating this apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without colliding with my own body.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake will be at (1,0), and its tail will be at (2,0).\n\nNext, I can consider moving up to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3) to reach (2,3), but I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is far away. Maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going right to (3,0), but there's no apple there, and it might not be the most efficient path.\n\nOption 2: Go up to (2,1), then (2,2), then (2,3) to eat the apple at (2,3).\n\nThat's another option. Let's see:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1): UP.\n\nThen (2,1) to (2,2): UP.\n\nThen (2,2) to (2,3): UP.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have space to maneuver.\n\nBut, going up from (2,3), what's next? There are apples at (4,5), (6,3), and (8,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to reach (4,5), I need to go right to (3,3), then (4,3), then up to (4,4), then (4,5).\n\nThat seems a bit far, and I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could go right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nBut again, that's a longer path, and I need to watch out for the enemy snake at (7,5).\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is at column 7, row 5.\n\nIf I go to (6,3), that's towards the center of the board.\n\nI need to consider the possible movements of the enemy snake. Since it's just the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (4,5) directly.\n\nFrom (2,0), to (4,5), that's a Manhattan distance of 7 steps.\n\nThat seems a bit far, and I might expose myself to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0), which is at (8,0), a distance of 6 steps to the right.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (8,0): RIGHT six times.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that I can navigate without hitting my own body.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is at column 7, row 5.\n\nIf I go to (8,0), I might get closer to the enemy snake, depending on its movements.\n\nI need to balance between eating apples quickly and avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe a better strategy is to eat the closest apples first, gaining points and growing my snake, while staying away from the enemy snake.\n\nSo, starting with the apple at (1,0), which is right next to me.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (1,0): LEFT.\n\nAfter eating it, I move to (1,0), and my tail is at (2,0).\n\nNext, I can move up to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3) to eat the apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can then decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me map this path:\n\n(1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3)\n\nAt (2,3), I can then consider moving right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (2,4), then (2,5), then (3,5), then (4,5) to eat the apple at (4,5).\n\nBut, the apple at (6,3) is closer in Manhattan distance from (2,3):\n\nFrom (2,3) to (6,3): |2-6| + |3-3| = 4 steps to the right.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (4,5): |2-4| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps (right twice, up twice).\n\nSo, both apples are equally distant from (2,3).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first.\n\nConsidering the position of the enemy snake at (7,5), going to (4,5) might bring me closer to it, whereas going to (6,3) is also somewhat towards the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (2,3), I could consider going for the apple at (8,0), which is at (8,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to (8,0): need to go down to (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), then right to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to stick with the closer apples.\n\nSo, let's stick with the initial plan:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0)\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), I can then decide to go for the apple at (6,3) or (4"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and going up to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). Wait, in the board state you provided, it shows me at (2,0). Let me make sure. In the board description:\n\nRow 0: dots, apple at (1,0), my snake at (2,0), dots, dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (8,0), dots.\n\nBut in the initial information, it says I'm at (3,0). There might be a discrepancy here. Maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nIn the board state, position (2,0) has my snake, and (3,0) is just dots. So, I'm at (2,0). Got it.\n\nNow, there are apples at (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), and (1,0). Enemy snake is at (6,5), with no body parts listed, so it's just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was to the RIGHT, and my rationale was to go for the closest apple, which was at (1,0), but I think I need to reevaluate that.\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (2,0), and I considered going LEFT to (1,0). But according to the board state, (1,0) has an apple, and (2,0) has my snake. So, if I move LEFT from (2,0) to (1,0), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in the last move, I chose to go RIGHT, which would take me to (3,0), which is just dots. Maybe I need to think again.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position at (2,0):\n\n- (1,0): Manhattan distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is indeed at (1,0), just one step to the left.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. After eating it, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nFrom (2,0), if I go LEFT to (1,0), I eat the apple, and my tail will be at (2,0). Then, if I move UP to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), and so on, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in or run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,5), which is quite a distance away. Since it doesn't have any body parts, it's less threatening for now. But I still need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (2,3), which is directly above me. That would require me to move UP three times, to (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). After eating that apple, I would grow, and then I could consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut, considering the distances, going to (1,0) is only one step, whereas going to (2,3) is three steps. So, it's faster to go for (1,0).\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,0), I can plan my path to the next apple without getting too close to the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about potential paths:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple at (2,3)\n\nAfter eating (2,3), I can then consider moving to (6,3) or (4,5). Let's see:\n\nFrom (2,3):\n\n- To (6,3): RIGHT four times\n\n- To (4,5): RIGHT twice, UP two times\n\nBoth are equally distant, but going to (6,3) might bring me closer to the enemy snake at (6,5). So, perhaps going to (4,5) is better, as it's diagonally away.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (8,0), which is far to the right.\n\nFrom (2,3), to (8,0):\n\n- DOWN to (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)\n\nThat's a longer path, and again, going towards (6,0) might bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,3), going to (4,5) is a better choice.\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (2,3):\n\n1. UP to (2,1)\n\n2. UP to (2,2)\n\n3. UP to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\nThen, decide to go to (4,5):\n\n4. RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n6. UP to (4,4)\n\n7. UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThis seems feasible, but it's a longer path compared to going for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nConsidering that the enemy snake is at (6,5), and assuming it's not moving yet, I think it's safer to go for the closer apples first and gain points quickly.\n\nMoreover, by going for (1,0) first, I can start building my snake's length without exposing myself too much to the enemy.\n\nSo, perhaps the best strategy is:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), I can consider which apple to go for next, based on the enemy snake's position and my own snake's length.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0) after eating (1,0), but that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nRisk assessment:\n\n- Going for (1,0):\n\n- Immediate: low risk, just one step to the left.\n\n- After eating (1,0):\n\n- Moving up to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), then right to (2,3).\n\n- The enemy snake is at (6,5), which is far away, so low risk.\n\n- After eating (2,3):\n\n- Options to go to (4,5) or (6,3).\n\n- (4,5) is at (4,5), and (6,3) is at (6,3).\n\n- (4,5) is diagonally up and to the right, while (6,3) is directly to the right.\n\n- The enemy is at (6,5), so going to (6,3) might bring me closer to it.\n\n- Perhaps going to (4,5) first is better.\n\n- From (2,3) to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), UP to (4,4), (4,5).\n\n- That's four steps.\n\n- From (2,3) to (6,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).\n\n- Also four steps.\n\n- So, similar distance.\n\n- But (4,5) is closer to the center, whereas (6,3) is closer to the enemy.\n\n- Maybe (4,5) is safer.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\n6. RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n7. RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n8. UP to (4,4)\n\n9. UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the remaining apples at (6,3) and (8,0), depending on the enemy's position.\n\nBut this is getting too ahead. I should focus on the immediate next move.\n\nGiven that, I think the best first move is to go LEFT to (1,0) and eat that apple.\n\nHowever,"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and going up to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). In the board state, it shows me at (2,0), with apples at (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), and (1,0). There's an enemy snake at (6,5) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was to the RIGHT, but I think I need to reconsider that. Let me look at the distances to each apple from my current position at (2,0):\n\n- (1,0): Manhattan distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,0), just one step to the left. If I go LEFT to (1,0), I'll eat the apple and grow. After eating it, my tail will be at (2,0), and I need to make sure not to run into it.\n\nLet me think about my next moves after eating (1,0):\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple at (2,3)\n\nAfter eating (2,3), I can then consider moving to another apple. The enemy snake is at (6,5), which is a bit far, so for now, it's not a immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (2,3) directly:\n\n1. UP to (2,1)\n\n2. UP to (2,2)\n\n3. UP to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\nThen, decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut going for the closer apple at (1,0) first seems more efficient since it's only one step away, and I can gain a point quickly.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), I can move up to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and then right to (2,3) to eat another apple.\n\nLet me visualize this path:\n\n- From (2,0):\n\n- LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple\n\n- Now, my tail is at (2,0)\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple\n\nAt this point, I've eaten two apples, and my snake has grown. The enemy snake is still at (6,5), and I need to be cautious not to get too close.\n\nNext, I can consider going for the apple at (4,5). From (2,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThat seems manageable, and it keeps me away from the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (6,3), which is closer:\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3) - eat apple\n\nBut this brings me closer to the enemy at (6,5), which might not be ideal.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (4,5) is a better choice.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I can then consider going for the apple at (8,0):\n\n- RIGHT to (5,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - eat apple\n\nThat's a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake during this journey.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0) after eating (2,3), but that seems even longer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (8,0) earlier.\n\nFrom (2,3), the distance to (8,0) is:\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - total of 3 steps down\n\nThat's 6 + 3 = 9 steps, which is a long path.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThen, go to (6,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (5,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4), (6,3) - eat apple\n\nAfter that, go to (8,0):\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3), (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - eat apple\n\nThis seems like a longer game, and I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't interfering.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to focus on the closer apples first and gain points quickly.\n\nSo, my initial plan is:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\n6. RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n7. RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n8. UP to (4,4)\n\n9. UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide my next move, which is to go LEFT to (1,0) and eat that apple.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (1,0), I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my tail will be at (2,0). Then, if I move UP to (1,1), that's fine. Then to (1,2), then (1,3), and then RIGHT to (2,3).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me on my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider going for the apple at (2,3) directly without going to (1,0) first.\n\nLet me compare the two options:\n\nOption A: Go to (1,0) first\n\n- Pros: Closer apple, quicker point gain\n\n- Cons: Need to make several moves to reach another apple after that\n\nOption B: Go to (2,3) first\n\n- Pros: Direct path to another apple\n\n- Cons: Longer distance, delayed point gain\n\nI think Option A is better because it allows me to gain points faster and build my snake's length sooner.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to go LEFT to (1,0) and eat that apple.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{LEFT}} \\]"

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (1, 0). Wait, in the board state, it shows me at (2,0), but according to the text, it's (1,0). Let me double-check that. The board state shows:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . 1 . . .\n\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n 4 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n 3 . . A . . .

So, I'll go with that.\n\nApples are at: (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), (2,4)\n\nEnemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (6,7) with body at []\n\nSo, it's just the head, no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which apple to go for first. I should probably go for the closest one to maximize my points quickly.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,0) to each apple:\n\n- (4,5): |1-4| + |0-5| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (2,3): |1-2| + |0-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (8,0): |1-8| + |0-0| = 7 + 0 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |1-6| + |0-3| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (2,4): |1-2| + |0-4| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is (2,3) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, there's also (2,4) at a distance of 5, but (2,3) is closer.\n\nWait, actually, (2,3) is at (2,3), which is up and to the right from my position (1,0).\n\nLet me plot a path to (2,3):\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple\n\nThat's 4 steps, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (2,4) first, which is at (2,4):\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's 5 steps, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nBut since (2,3) is closer, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (6,7). It's relatively far away, so for now, it's not a immediate threat.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the position of other apples after eating one. For example, if I eat (2,3), then maybe I can go for (4,5) next, which is at (4,5):\n\nFrom (2,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThat's 4 more steps.\n\nSo, total steps to eat two apples: 4 + 4 = 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (2,4) first:\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4) - eat apple\n\nThen, go to (2,3):\n\n- DOWN to (2,3) - eat apple\n\nThat's 5 + 1 = 6 steps.\n\nWait, that seems more efficient.\n\nWait, but (2,3) is down from (2,4), so it's DOWN to (2,3).\n\nBut, is (2,3) really down from (2,4)? Yes, because higher Y is up, so lower Y is down.\n\nSo, from (2,4), DOWN to (2,3) - eat apple.\n\nThen, maybe go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThat's 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 steps in total after eating (2,4), so 5 + 5 = 10 steps for three apples.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (2,3):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple\n\n2. Then go to (2,4):\n\n- UP to (2,4) - eat apple\n\n3. Then go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nTotal steps: 4 + 1 + 3 = 8 steps.\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Go to (2,4):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4) - eat apple\n\n2. Then go to (2,3):\n\n- DOWN to (2,3) - eat apple\n\n3. Then go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nTotal steps: 5 + 1 + 4 = 10 steps.\n\nSo, Option 1 is more efficient in terms of steps.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy snake. If I go to (2,3) first, and then (2,4), the enemy is at (6,7), which is up and to the right. So, maybe I can move away from it.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nWait, after eating (2,3), my body will be at (2,3) and (1,3), assuming I grew from eating the apple.\n\nThen, moving to (2,4), I need to make sure that (2,4) isn't occupied by the enemy or my body. According to the board, it's an apple, so it's empty except for the apple.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (2,4), I can move to (2,3), but I need to make sure that my tail has moved away from (2,3). Wait, no, because I'm growing by eating apples, so my tail stays the same length unless I don't eat an apple.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning your tail stays where it is for an extra move.\n\nWait, but in this game, I think when you eat an apple, you gain a point and grow, so your tail extends.\n\nBut in the standard Snake game, eating an apple makes your snake longer, so you don't lose the length.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify how growth works in this game.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n1. If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2. If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\n3. The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nAssuming that \"grow\" means your snake gets longer, so your tail stays where it is for an extra move.\n\nWait, but in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't shrink on the next move; instead, your snake gets longer by the length of the apple you ate.\n\nIn this game, since it's turn-based, perhaps each move you advance your head and if you eat an apple, your tail stays in place until the next move.\n\nI need to be careful with that.\n\nLet me try to simulate Option 1:\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (0,0) - but that's the tail, so maybe T is"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). There are apples at (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), and (1,0). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (7,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, nothing there.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (4,5), dots, dots, enemy snake at (7,5), dots, dots.\n\nRow 4: all dots.\n\nRow 3: dots, dots, apple at (2,3), dots, dots, dots, apple at (6,3), dots, dots, dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: dots, apple at (1,0), my snake at (2,0), dots, dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (8,0), dots.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,0), and there are apples at (1,0), (2,3), (4,5), (6,3), and (8,0). The enemy snake is at (7,5).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (2,0) to each apple:\n\n- (1,0): distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,0), just one step to the left.\n\nBut I should also consider whether going for that apple might put me in harm's way with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,5), which is quite far from my current position. Also, it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head. Maybe it's safer to go for the closer apples first.\n\nMoreover, after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that the path to the next apple is navigable with the increased length.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Go left to (1,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (1,0): that's LEFT.\n\nAfter eating this apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without colliding with my own body.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake will be at (1,0), and its tail will be at (2,0).\n\nNext, I can consider moving up to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3) to reach (2,3), but I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is far away. Maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going right to (3,0), but there's no apple there, and it might not be the most efficient path.\n\nOption 2: Go up to (2,1), then (2,2), then (2,3) to eat the apple at (2,3).\n\nThat's another option. Let's see:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1): UP.\n\nThen (2,1) to (2,2): UP.\n\nThen (2,2) to (2,3): UP.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have space to maneuver.\n\nBut, going up from (2,3), what's next? There are apples at (4,5), (6,3), and (8,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to reach (4,5), I need to go right to (3,3), then (4,3), then up to (4,4), then (4,5).\n\nThat seems a bit far, and I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could go right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nBut again, that's a longer path, and I need to watch out for the enemy snake at (7,5).\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is at column 7, row 5.\n\nIf I go to (6,3), that's towards the center of the board.\n\nI need to consider the possible movements of the enemy snake. Since it's just the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (4,5) directly.\n\nFrom (2,0), to (4,5), that's a Manhattan distance of 7 steps.\n\nThat seems a bit far, and I might expose myself to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0), which is at (8,0), a distance of 6 steps to the right.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (8,0): RIGHT six times.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that I can navigate without hitting my own body.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is at column 7, row 5.\n\nIf I go to (8,0), I might get closer to the enemy snake, depending on its movements.\n\nI need to balance between eating apples quickly and avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe a better strategy is to eat the closest apples first, gaining points and growing my snake, while staying away from the enemy snake.\n\nSo, starting with the apple at (1,0), which is right next to me.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (1,0): LEFT.\n\nAfter eating it, I move to (1,0), and my tail is at (2,0).\n\nNext, I can move up to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3) to eat the apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can then decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me map this path:\n\n(1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3)\n\nAt (2,3), I can then consider moving right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (2,4), then (2,5), then (3,5), then (4,5) to eat the apple at (4,5).\n\nBut, the apple at (6,3) is closer in Manhattan distance from (2,3):\n\nFrom (2,3) to (6,3): |2-6| + |3-3| = 4 steps to the right.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (4,5): |2-4| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps (right twice, up twice).\n\nSo, both apples are equally distant from (2,3).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first.\n\nConsidering the position of the enemy snake at (7,5), going to (4,5) might bring me closer to it, whereas going to (6,3) is also somewhat towards the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (2,3), I could consider going for the apple at (8,0), which is at (8,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to (8,0): need to go down to (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), then right to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to stick with the closer apples.\n\nSo, let's stick with the initial plan:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0)\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), I can then decide to go for the apple at (6,3) or (4"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and going up to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,0). Wait, in the board state you provided, it shows me at (2,0). Let me make sure. In the board description:\n\nRow 0: dots, apple at (1,0), my snake at (2,0), dots, dots, dots, dots, dots, apple at (8,0), dots.\n\nBut in the initial information, it says I'm at (3,0). There might be a discrepancy here. Maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nIn the board state, position (2,0) has my snake, and (3,0) is just dots. So, I'm at (2,0). Got it.\n\nNow, there are apples at (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), and (1,0). Enemy snake is at (6,5), with no body parts listed, so it's just the head for now.\n\nMy last move was to the RIGHT, and my rationale was to go for the closest apple, which was at (1,0), but I think I need to reevaluate that.\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (2,0), and I considered going LEFT to (1,0). But according to the board state, (1,0) has an apple, and (2,0) has my snake. So, if I move LEFT from (2,0) to (1,0), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in the last move, I chose to go RIGHT, which would take me to (3,0), which is just dots. Maybe I need to think again.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position at (2,0):\n\n- (1,0): Manhattan distance is |2-1| + |0-0| = 1\n\n- (2,3): |2-2| + |0-3| = 3\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |0-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is indeed at (1,0), just one step to the left.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. After eating it, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nFrom (2,0), if I go LEFT to (1,0), I eat the apple, and my tail will be at (2,0). Then, if I move UP to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), and so on, I need to ensure that I don't box myself in or run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,5), which is quite a distance away. Since it doesn't have any body parts, it's less threatening for now. But I still need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (2,3), which is directly above me. That would require me to move UP three times, to (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). After eating that apple, I would grow, and then I could consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut, considering the distances, going to (1,0) is only one step, whereas going to (2,3) is three steps. So, it's faster to go for (1,0).\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,0), I can plan my path to the next apple without getting too close to the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about potential paths:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple at (2,3)\n\nAfter eating (2,3), I can then consider moving to (6,3) or (4,5). Let's see:\n\nFrom (2,3):\n\n- To (6,3): RIGHT four times\n\n- To (4,5): RIGHT twice, UP two times\n\nBoth are equally distant, but going to (6,3) might bring me closer to the enemy snake at (6,5). So, perhaps going to (4,5) is better, as it's diagonally away.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (8,0), which is far to the right.\n\nFrom (2,3), to (8,0):\n\n- DOWN to (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)\n\nThat's a longer path, and again, going towards (6,0) might bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,3), going to (4,5) is a better choice.\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (2,3):\n\n1. UP to (2,1)\n\n2. UP to (2,2)\n\n3. UP to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\nThen, decide to go to (4,5):\n\n4. RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n6. UP to (4,4)\n\n7. UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThis seems feasible, but it's a longer path compared to going for the closer apple at (1,0) first.\n\nConsidering that the enemy snake is at (6,5), and assuming it's not moving yet, I think it's safer to go for the closer apples first and gain points quickly.\n\nMoreover, by going for (1,0) first, I can start building my snake's length without exposing myself too much to the enemy.\n\nSo, perhaps the best strategy is:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), I can consider which apple to go for next, based on the enemy snake's position and my own snake's length.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0) after eating (1,0), but that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nRisk assessment:\n\n- Going for (1,0):\n\n- Immediate: low risk, just one step to the left.\n\n- After eating (1,0):\n\n- Moving up to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), then right to (2,3).\n\n- The enemy snake is at (6,5), which is far away, so low risk.\n\n- After eating (2,3):\n\n- Options to go to (4,5) or (6,3).\n\n- (4,5) is at (4,5), and (6,3) is at (6,3).\n\n- (4,5) is diagonally up and to the right, while (6,3) is directly to the right.\n\n- The enemy is at (6,5), so going to (6,3) might bring me closer to it.\n\n- Perhaps going to (4,5) first is better.\n\n- From (2,3) to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), UP to (4,4), (4,5).\n\n- That's four steps.\n\n- From (2,3) to (6,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).\n\n- Also four steps.\n\n- So, similar distance.\n\n- But (4,5) is closer to the center, whereas (6,3) is closer to the enemy.\n\n- Maybe (4,5) is safer.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,0) - eat apple, grow\n\n2. UP to (1,1)\n\n3. UP to (1,2)\n\n4. UP to (1,3)\n\n5. RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple, grow\n\n6. RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n7. RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n8. UP to (4,4)\n\n9. UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for the remaining apples at (6,3) and (8,0), depending on the enemy's position.\n\nBut this is getting too ahead. I should focus on the immediate next move.\n\nGiven that, I think the best first move is to go LEFT to (1,0) and eat that apple.\n\nHowever,"

From (2,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThat seems manageable, and it keeps me away from the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (6,3), which is closer:\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3) - eat apple\n\nBut this brings me closer to the enemy at (6,5), which might not be ideal.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (4,5) is a better choice.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I can then consider going for the apple at (8,0):\n\n- RIGHT to (5,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (8,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - eat apple\n\nThat's a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake during this journey.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (8,0) after eating (2,3), but that seems even longer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider eating the apple at (8,0) earlier.\n\nFrom (2,3), the distance to (8,0) is:\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - total of 3 steps down\n\nThat's 6 + 3 = 9 steps, which is a long path.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThen, go to (6,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (5,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,4), (6,3) - eat apple\n\nAfter that, go to (8,0):\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3), (8,3)\n\n- DOWN to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) - eat apple\n\nThis seems like a longer game, and I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't interfering.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to focus on the closer apples first and gain points quickly.\n\nSo, my initial plan is:\n\n1.

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (1, 0). Wait, in the board state, it shows me at (2,0), but according to the text, it's (1,0). Let me double-check that. The board state shows:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . 1 . . .\n\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n 4 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n 3 . . A . . .

I should probably go for the closest one to maximize my points quickly.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,0) to each apple:\n\n- (4,5): |1-4| + |0-5| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (2,3): |1-2| + |0-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (8,0): |1-8| + |0-0| = 7 + 0 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |1-6| + |0-3| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (2,4): |1-2| + |0-4| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is (2,3) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, there's also (2,4) at a distance of 5, but (2,3) is closer.\n\nWait, actually, (2,3) is at (2,3), which is up and to the right from my position (1,0).\n\nLet me plot a path to (2,3):\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple\n\nThat's 4 steps, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (2,4) first, which is at (2,4):\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's 5 steps, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nBut since (2,3) is closer, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (6,7). It's relatively far away, so for now, it's not a immediate threat.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the position of other apples after eating one. For example, if I eat (2,3), then maybe I can go for (4,5) next, which is at (4,5):\n\nFrom (2,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThat's 4 more steps.\n\nSo, total steps to eat two apples: 4 + 4 = 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (2,4) first:\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4) - eat apple\n\nThen, go to (2,3):\n\n- DOWN to (2,3) - eat apple\n\nThat's 5 + 1 = 6 steps.\n\nWait, that seems more efficient.\n\nWait, but (2,3) is down from (2,4), so it's DOWN to (2,3).\n\nBut, is (2,3) really down from (2,4)? Yes, because higher Y is up, so lower Y is down.\n\nSo, from (2,4), DOWN to (2,3) - eat apple.\n\nThen, maybe go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThat's 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 steps in total after eating (2,4), so 5 + 5 = 10 steps for three apples.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (2,3):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple\n\n2. Then go to (2,4):\n\n- UP to (2,4) - eat apple\n\n3. Then go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nTotal steps: 4 + 1 + 3 = 8 steps.\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Go to (2,4):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4) - eat apple\n\n2. Then go to (2,3):\n\n- DOWN to (2,3) - eat apple\n\n3. Then go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- UP to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nTotal steps: 5 + 1 + 4 = 10 steps.\n\nSo, Option 1 is more efficient in terms of steps.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy snake. If I go to (2,3) first, and then (2,4), the enemy is at (6,7), which is up and to the right. So, maybe I can move away from it.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nWait, after eating (2,3), my body will be at (2,3) and (1,3), assuming I grew from eating the apple.\n\nThen, moving to (2,4), I need to make sure that (2,4) isn't occupied by the enemy or my body. According to the board, it's an apple, so it's empty except for the apple.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (2,4), I can move to (2,3), but I need to make sure that my tail has moved away from (2,3). Wait, no, because I'm growing by eating apples, so my tail stays the same length unless I don't eat an apple.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning your tail stays where it is for an extra move.\n\nWait, but in this game, I think when you eat an apple, you gain a point and grow, so your tail extends.\n\nBut in the standard Snake game, eating an apple makes your snake longer, so you don't lose the length.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify how growth works in this game.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n1. If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2. If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\n3. The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nAssuming that \"grow\" means your snake gets longer, so your tail stays where it is for an extra move.\n\nWait, but in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't shrink on the next move; instead, your snake gets longer by the length of the apple you ate.\n\nIn this game, since it's turn-based, perhaps each move you advance your head and if you eat an apple, your tail stays in place until the next move.\n\nI need to be careful with that.\n\nLet me try to simulate Option 1:\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (0,0) - but that's the tail, so maybe T is"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "Let's think this through...\n\nI'm currently at position (5, 7), and I want to get closer to the apple at (2, 3). Moving left again will bring me closer to the apple, and I'll be able to see Snake #2's next move. I'm still far enough from the top wall, so I don't have to worry about getting stuck there yet.\n\nMy strategy for now is still to focus on grabbing apples and growing as much as possible, while keeping an eye on Snake #2's movements.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and going up to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (0, 0). Wait, the board shows '2' at (1,0), but according to the text, it's (0,0). There might be a confusion here. Let's check the board again:\n\n```\n\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 7 . . . . . 1 . . . .\n\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n 4 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n 3 . . A . . . A . . .\n\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 0 2 T . . . . . . A .\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n```\n\nSo, '2' is at (1,0), and 'T' is at (0,0). Maybe 'T' is the tail. So, my head is at (1,0), and my tail is at (0,0). That makes sense.\n\nApples are at: (4,5), (2,3), (8,0), (6,3), (2,4)\n\nEnemy snakes positions:\n\n- Snake #1 is at position (5,7) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so just one enemy snake at (5,7), and it has no body parts, meaning it's just the head.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat apples efficiently without running into walls, the enemy, or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider which apple to go for first. I should probably go for the closest one to maximize my points quickly.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,0) to each apple:\n\n- (4,5): |1-4| + |0-5| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- (2,3): |1-2| + |0-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (8,0): |1-8| + |0-0| = 7 + 0 = 7\n\n- (6,3): |1-6| + |0-3| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (2,4): |1-2| + |0-4| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is (2,3) with a distance of 4.\n\nLet me plot a path to (2,3):\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,3) - eat apple\n\nThat's 4 steps, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (2,4) first, which is at (2,4):\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- UP to (1,1)\n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's 5 steps.\n\nBut since (2,3) is closer, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (2,3) to other apples:\n\n- (4,5): |2-4| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |3-0| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (6,3): |2-6| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- (2,4): |2-2| + |3-4| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, the closest from (2,3) is (2,4), which is just up by one step.\n\nThen, from (2,4), I can go to (4,5):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4)\n\n- UP to (4,5) - eat apple\n\nThat's 3 steps.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3) - eat apple\n\nThat's 4 steps.\n\nBut going to (2,4) first is shorter.\n\nSo, the sequence would be:\n\n1. (1,0) to (2,3) - 4 steps\n\n2. (2,3) to (2,4) - 1 step\n\n3. (2,4) to (4,5) - 3 steps\n\nTotal steps: 4 + 1 + 3 = 8 steps for three apples.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,4), I could go for (6,3):\n\nFrom (2,4):\n\n- DOWN to (2,3) - eat apple\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3) - eat apple\n\nThat's 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 4 (to 2,3) + 1 (to 2,4) + 5 (to 6,3) = 10 steps.\n\nBut I can optimize this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating (2,3), then (2,4), then (6,3), then (4,5), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut I need to see the distances between them.\n\nFrom (2,3):\n\n- To (2,4): 1 step up\n\n- To (6,3): 4 steps right\n\n- To (4,5): 2 steps right and 2 steps up\n\n- To (8,0): 6 steps right and 3 steps down\n\nSo, going to (2,4) first makes sense, then to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,7), and it's just the head with no body. So, it's probably moving around, but for now, it's at (5,7).\n\nI need to plan my path to avoid it.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes except for me and snake #1.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I eat apples, my snake grows, so I have to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet's think about my first move.\n\nI'm at (1,0), and I need to go up to (1,1).\n\nBut wait, the board shows '2' at (1,0) and 'T' at (0,0). Maybe 'T' is my tail.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, your tail stays until the next move unless you eat an apple.\n\nWait, in this game, when you eat an apple, you grow, meaning your tail stays where it is for an extra move.\n\nSo, if I move from (1,0) to (1,1), my tail will be at (1,0).\n\nThen, if I move to (1,2), my tail will still be at (1,0), and my body will be at (1,1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead my head into my own body.\n\nGiven that, let's plan the path again.\n\nStart at (1,0).\n\nMove UP to (1,1). Tail is at (1,0).\n\nMove UP to (1,2). Body is at (1,1), tail is at (1,0).\n\nMove UP to (1,3). Body is at (1,2), previous body at (1,1), tail at (1,0).\n\nMove RIGHT to (2,3). Eat apple at (2,3). Grow, so tail stays at (1,0).\n\nNow, body is at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), tail at (1,0).\n\nMove UP to (2,4). Eat apple at (2,4). Grow again, tail stays at (1,0).\n\nNow, body is at (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), tail at (1,0).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that my head doesn't collide with any part of my body.\n\nGiven that, the path seems safe so far.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (5,7). It's up and to the right of my current position.\n\nI need to be careful not to cross paths with it.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake is moving randomly, but for now, it's at (5,7), and it has no body parts.\n\nSo, it's less of a threat immediately.\n\nGiven that, I think"
