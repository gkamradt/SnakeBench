The apple at position (4, 5) is the closest to you, however, it might be risky to get it considering the possible moves from the Snakes.\n\nConsidering the current position of the apple (4, 5), you might want to move right to position (6, 5), then move up to position (7, 8), then move left to position (4, 5) to get the apple.\n\nTherefore, my strategy would be to move right to position (6, 5), then move up to position (7, 8), then move left to position (4, 5) to get the apple.\n\nMy next move is: RIGHT"
