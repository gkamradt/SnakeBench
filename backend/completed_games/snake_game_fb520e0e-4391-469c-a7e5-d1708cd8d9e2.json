            "rationale": "Alright, so I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,7). Let's see what's around me.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Apples are at (4,9), (7,9), (8,9), (5,6), and (6,5).\n\n- Enemy snake number 1 is at (8,8), with no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\n- My snake is at (2,7), and since it's my first move, I assume it's just the head as well.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I should consider which one is closest or which path is safest.\n\nLet me plot out the positions:\n\n- My head: (2,7)\n\n- Apples: (4,9), (7,9), (8,9), (5,6), (6,5)\n\n- Enemy snake: (8,8)\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances since we're dealing with grid movements.\n\nManhattan distance formula: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|\n\n1. To (4,9):\n\n|2-4| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. To (7,9):\n\n|2-7| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n3. To (8,9):\n\n|2-8| + |7-9| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n4. To (5,6):\n\n|2-5| + |7-6| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. To (6,5):\n\n|2-6| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,9) and (5,6), both with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to think about the paths to these apples and see if there are any obstacles or potential dangers.\n\nLet's consider the path to (4,9):\n\nFrom (2,7) to (4,9):\n\n- Move right twice: RIGHT, RIGHT\n\n- Then up twice: UP, UP\n\nSo, sequence: RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP\n\nSimilarly, path to (5,6):\n\nFrom (2,7) to (5,6):\n\n- Move right three times: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT\n\n- Then down once: DOWN\n\nSequence: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,8). It's relatively far from my current position, and its body is empty, so it's just the head.\n\nI should be cautious of its movement, but for now, it's not immediately threatening.\n\nAlso, I need to think about growing upon eating an apple. When I eat an apple, my snake grows in length by one segment.\n\nSo, if I go for (4,9), I'll grow to include (4,9), and my tail will remain where it was, but since it's just the head now, the tail will stay at (2,7).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and the new head is at the apple's position.\n\nBut in this game, it seems that when you move to an apple, you gain a point and grow, but I need to confirm how the growth works.\n\nLooking back at the rules:\n\n\"1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nI think that means that you extend your body by one segment, so your tail remains where it was, and your new head is at the apple's position.\n\nBut in standard Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves to the apple, increasing your length.\n\nIn this game, since it's multi-apple, I need to be careful not to run into my own body or other snakes.\n\nGiven that, if I move to (4,9), I'll be at (4,9), and my previous position (2,7) will now be part of my body.\n\nWait, no. In standard Snake, when you move, your body shifts forward, so the new head is at the moved position, and the tail remains unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail stays.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLet me read the rules again:\n\n\"1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\n\"2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\"\n\nSo, it seems that when you move onto an apple, you grow, meaning your body length increases by one, and you gain a point.\n\nTherefore, if I move to (4,9) and eat the apple, my head will be at (4,9), and my previous position (2,7) will still be part of my body.\n\nSo, my body would be at (2,7) and (4,9) after eating the apple.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. In standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves, increasing your length.\n\nSo, perhaps in this game, when you move to an apple, your head is at the apple's position, and your previous positions remain as your body.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (4,9), my snake would have body parts at (2,7) and head at (4,9), making its length two segments.\n\nIf I move again without eating an apple, my tail would move forward, so the last segment would advance.\n\nBut in this game, it seems that eating an apple makes you grow by one segment, so your tail stays, and your head moves.\n\nI need to confirm this.\n\nLooking back at the rules:\n\n\"1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\n\"2) If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\"\n\nIt's a bit unclear how the growth exactly works, but in standard Snake, eating an apple makes your tail stay, and your head moves, increasing your length.\n\nI'll assume similar behavior here.\n\nSo, if I move to (4,9) and eat the apple, my head is at (4,9), and my previous position (2,7) is now the tail, and my length is two segments.\n\nIf I move again without eating an apple, my tail moves forward as usual.\n\nOkay, with that in mind, let's plan my path.\n\nFirst, I'll consider going for the closest apple at (4,9).\n\nPath: RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nCurrently, the enemy snake is at (8,8), and its body is empty.\n\nSo, it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement.\n\nSince it's a snake game, likely the enemy will also be trying to eat apples without dying.\n\nBut without knowing its strategy, I'll assume it moves randomly or towards the nearest apple.\n\nGiven that, I should focus on getting to (4,9) safely.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst move: RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nSecond move: RIGHT to (4,7)\n\nThird move: UP to (4,8)\n\nFourth move: UP to (4,9) to eat the apple.\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't block my path or that I don't run into myself.\n\nSince I'm growing upon eating the apple, I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way.\n\nWait, in standard Snake, your tail moves forward with each move, so as long as your path doesn't loop back on itself, you should be fine.\n\nIn this game, since eating an apple makes you grow, your tail stays, and your head extends.\n\nBut I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when you eat an apple, your tail remains, and your head moves to the new position, adding a new segment at the head's new position.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (4,9), my snake would have segments at (2,7) and (4,9).\n\nThen, if I move my head to (5,9), my tail (2,7) would stay because I ate an apple, so my snake would be at (4,9) and (5,9).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIn standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves, increasing your length by one.\n\nIn this game, it might be similar.\n\nSo, if I'm at (2,7), and I move to (4,9) and eat the apple, my snake would have segments at (2,7) and (4,9).\n\nThen, if I move to (5,9), my snake would have segments at (4,9) and (5,9), as the tail (2,7) is no longer part of the body unless I eat another apple.\n\nWait, no, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves, increasing your length by one segment.\n\nSo, in"

So, it's just the head and one body part.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many points as possible by eating apples, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or my own body.\n\nLet me think about the distances to each apple from my current position (2,8).\n\nStarting with (4,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |2 - 4| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Total steps: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nNext, (7,9):\n\n- Horizontal: |2 - 7| = 5\n\n- Vertical: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Total: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThen, (5,6):\n\n- Horizontal: |2 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical: |8 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total: 3 + 2 = 5\n\n(6,5):\n\n- Horizontal: |2 - 6| = 4\n\n- Vertical: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Total: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nAnd (4,1):\n\n- Horizontal: |2 - 4| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Total: 2 + 7 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,9) with 3 steps, followed by (5,6) with 5 steps, then (7,9) with 6 steps, (6,5) with 7 steps, and (4,1) with 9 steps.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (4,9). It's nearby and requires fewer moves, which means less time exposed to the enemy snake.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. It's at (8,9), and its body is at (8,8). So, it's on the top row, towards the right side of the board.\n\nIf I go for (4,9), I'll be moving to the right twice and up once from my current position (2,8). So, first to (3,8), then (4,8), and finally (4,9).\n\nI need to make sure that during these moves, I don't run into the enemy snake or its body.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,9), and its body is at (8,8). So, it's on the top row, and its body is directly below its head.\n\nI need to anticipate where the enemy might move. If it's trying to eat apples, it might go for the apples on the top row, like (7,9) or (4,9). Hmm.\n\nIf I move towards (4,9), I might be crossing paths with the enemy, especially if it's also aiming for that apple.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for a different apple to avoid direct confrontation.\n\nLet's look at (5,6), which is another relatively close apple.\n\nFrom (2,8) to (5,6):\n\n- Right 3 steps: to (5,8)\n\n- Down 2 steps: to (5,6)\n\nTotal steps: 5\n\nThat's more steps than going to (4,9), but it might be safer if the enemy is focused on the top row.\n\nAlso, (5,6) is not on the top row, so perhaps the enemy won't be competing for it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, (6,5) is another option, but it's farther away with 7 steps.\n\n(7,9) is on the top row, which might be risky due to the enemy's position.\n\n(4,1) is way too far down, and it's 9 steps away, which is too many.\n\nConsidering the risks, maybe I should go for (5,6). It's a bit farther than (4,9), but it might be safer.\n\nBut wait, I should also think about the growth mechanic. When I eat an apple, I grow in length by one segment.\n\nIn standard Snake games, eating an apple makes your tail stay, and your head extends, increasing your length.\n\nIn this game, it seems similar: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nSo, if I eat an apple, my snake will get longer, which could be both good and bad. It's good for points, but it also means I have more body to manage, increasing the chance of hitting myself by mistake.\n\nBut in this multi-apple scenario, with multiple snakes, I need to balance between eating apples for points and avoiding collisions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim for apples that are isolated, away from other apples and snakes, to minimize risks.\n\n(5,6) seems to be somewhat isolated. The nearest apple to it is (6,5), which is one step down.\n\nSo, after eating at (5,6), I could potentially go for (6,5) next, extending my snake further.\n\nBut I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nLet me think about the path to (5,6):\n\nFrom (2,8):\n\n1. RIGHT to (3,8)\n\n2. RIGHT to (4,8)\n\n3. RIGHT to (5,8)\n\n4. DOWN to (5,7)\n\n5. DOWN to (5,6)\n\nThat's 5 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shorter path if I move diagonally, but in this grid-based game, movement is only horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.\n\nSo, I have to stick to moving right, left, up, or down.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (8,9), I need to predict its possible moves.\n\nIf it's trying to eat apples, it might go for (7,9) or (4,9). If it goes for (7,9), it would need to move left to (7,9). If it goes for (4,9), it would need to move left to (4,9).\n\nIn either case, if I go for (4,9), there's a chance the enemy might get there first or block my path.\n\nWhereas if I go for (5,6), it's away from the enemy's current position, and it might not be its immediate target.\n\nTherefore, I think it's safer to go for (5,6).\n\nAnother consideration is that by going for (5,6), I might be able to position myself to go for more apples afterward without crossing the enemy's path.\n\nAfter eating at (5,6), I could potentially go for (6,5), then maybe head towards (4,1), depending on how the game progresses.\n\nBut that's getting too ahead. For now, I should focus on reaching (5,6) safely.\n\nLet me think about potential obstacles on the path to (5,6).\n\nFrom (2,8):\n\n- Move right to (3,8): safe, no obstacles.\n\n- Move right to (4,8): still safe.\n\n- Move right to (5,8): should be fine.\n\n- Move down to (5,7): check for any snakes or apples here.\n\n- Move down to (5,6): the apple is there.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no snakes or apples blocking my path to (5,6). So, it seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious because the enemy snake could move towards me during my journey.\n\nBut if I reach (5,6) before the enemy can interfere, that would be ideal.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that when I eat the apple at (5,6), I grow in length, so my snake will be longer and have more segments to manage.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where my own body blocks my way.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a straight line, right three times and down twice, it should be manageable.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (5,6), my snake will have segments at (5,6) and (2,8), assuming the standard growth mechanic.\n\nWait, actually, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves, increasing your length by one segment.\n\nSo, if I'm at (2,8) and I move to (5,6) while eating the apple, my snake would have segments at (5,6) and (2,8).\n\nThen, if I move again, say to (6,6), my snake would have segments at (5,6) and (6,6), as the tail moves forward.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to run into my own body.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a straight line, right three times and down twice, and there are no other snakes or apples in the way, it"
