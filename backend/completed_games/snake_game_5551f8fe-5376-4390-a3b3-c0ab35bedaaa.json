There are several apples on the board, with the closest one at (6, 3).\n\nGiven the current situation, I have a few options to consider:\n\n1. Move towards the apple at (6, 3) to gain a point and grow my snake. This would be a good offensive move, as it would potentially put me in a stronger position to control the board.\n\n2. Alternatively, I could try to position myself to cut off the enemy snake's movements, forcing it into a corner or against a wall. This could be a more defensive strategy, as it would aim to limit the opponent's options.\n\n3. I could also stay in my current position and wait for the enemy snake to make a move, then react accordingly. This would be a more passive approach, but it could allow me to gather information and make a more informed decision on my next move.\n\nAfter weighing the pros and cons of each option, I think the best course of action is to move RIGHT towards the apple at (6, 3).
