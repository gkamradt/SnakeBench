            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (5,1). There are apples at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. Got it.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, meaning empty.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots with apples at columns 3,5,6,7.\n\nRow 4: dots with Snake #1 at column 5.\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: dots with an apple at column 3.\n\nRow 1: dots with an apple at column 1 and my snake at column 6.\n\nRow 0: all dots.\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,1), which is column 5, row 1. There's an apple at (1,1), which is column 1, row 1, so that's to the left of me. There's another apple at (3,2), which is column 3, row 2, so a bit up and left. Then there are multiple apples on row 5: (3,5), (7,5), (6,5).\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,4), which is directly above me, four rows up.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the proximity and also the potential paths to each apple without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,1). It's on the same row as me, row 1, and I'm at column 5. So, to get to column 1, I need to move left four times. But I need to check if there's anything in my way. Looking at row 1, it's all dots except for the apple at (1,1) and me at (5,1). So, it's clear.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (3,2), which is just one row up and two columns left from my current position. That might be a shorter path.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,1): left 4 units, same row.\n\n- To (3,2): left 2 units, up 1 unit.\n\n- To (3,5): left 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (7,5): right 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (6,5): right 1 unit, up 4 units.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,1) and (3,2), both requiring 3 moves: (1,1) is left 4, but since it's on the same row, it's actually just left 4; (3,2) is left 2 and up 1, total 3 moves.\n\nWait, movement is step by step, so left 2 and up 1 is 3 moves, while left 4 is 4 moves to (1,1). So (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at row 1: from (5,1) to (1,1), it's all dots in between, so clear path.\n\nTo (3,2): from (5,1), I can move left to (4,1), then up to (4,2), then left to (3,2). That's 3 moves, and looking at the board, row 2 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so clear.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so no issues.\n\nSo, both paths are clear.\n\nNow, which one to choose? If I go for (3,2), I gain a point and grow, then maybe proceed to another apple.\n\nAlternatively, going for (1,1) also gains a point and growth, but it's a bit further.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (5,4). It's directly above me at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to avoid colliding with it or its future positions.\n\nI don't know the enemy's movement yet, but I should assume it might move towards the apples as well.\n\nPerhaps I should try to reach an apple before the enemy does.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (5,4), it's closer to the apples on row 5 than I am.\n\nFrom (5,4) to, say, (3,5), it's left 2 and up 1, which is 3 moves.\n\nTo (7,5), it's right 2 and up 1, also 3 moves.\n\nTo (6,5), it's right 1 and up 1, 2 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5.\n\nWhereas I am closer to the apples at (1,1) and (3,2).\n\nSo, maybe I should go for (3,2) first, since it's closer and the enemy is also close to the row 5 apples.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), having grown, and then perhaps move towards (1,1) or consider the row 5 apples.\n\nBut, after eating (3,2), I would have to make sure not to run into the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go directly for (1,1), even though it's a bit further, to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is only one apple, while on row 5 there are three apples.\n\nIf I go for (1,1), I get one point, but the enemy might grab one or more from row 5.\n\nThen again, if I go for row 5, I might compete directly with the enemy.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for (3,2), which is closer, get that apple, grow, and then decide whether to go for another apple on row 5 or head towards (1,1).\n\nBut I need to consider the growth. When I eat an apple, my snake grows in length by one unit.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), I would have a longer snake, which could potentially block the enemy's path.\n\nBut I need to manage my tail's movement to avoid hitting it.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just choose to go for the closest apple, which is (3,2).\n\nSo, from (5,1) to (3,2):\n\nMove left to (4,1)\n\nThen up to (4,2)\n\nThen left to (3,2)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nBut in this game, I need to decide one move at a time.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut wait, the possible moves are just up, down, left, right, one step at a time.\n\nSo, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths to (3,2):\n\nPath 1:\n\nLeft to (4,1)\n\nUp to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\nUp to (5,2)\n\nLeft to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nWait, but moving up from (5,1) to (5,2) is possible, and then left twice to (3,2).\n\nSo, that's also three moves.\n\nComparing Path 1 and Path 2:\n\nPath 1:\n\n(5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\n(5,1) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nI need to see which path is safer.\n\nIn Path 1, moving left to (4,1) is safe, as it's empty.\n\nThen up to (4,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), which has an apple.\n\nIn Path 2, moving up to (5,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (4,2), empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), apple.\n\nBoth paths seem safe.\n\nBut in Path 1, after eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will be at (4,2), assuming I don't make any immediate turns.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your tail remains where it was, and you extend.\n\nWait, no, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you grow by not having your tail move on that turn.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nIn most snake games, each turn, the snake moves forward, and the tail moves forward unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail doesn't move forward, so your snake grows.\n\nSo, in this game, when I eat an apple, on the turn I eat it, my tail doesn't move"

There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,5), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9 to Row 0, with Row 9 being the top.\n\n- Apples are at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), (3,2).\n\n- My snake is at (4,1).\n\n- Enemy snake is at (5,4).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple at (1,1), which is left on the same row, or the one at (3,2), which is a bit up and left, or maybe aim for the apples on row 5.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (5,4), which is directly above me, I might want to avoid getting too close to it, especially since it could be moving towards the apples on row 5.\n\nLet me think about the distances:\n\n- To (1,1): left 3 units (from x=4 to x=1, y remains 1).\n\n- To (3,2): left 1 unit to x=3, up 1 unit to y=2.\n\n- To (3,5): left 1 unit to x=3, up 4 units to y=5.\n\n- To (7,5): right 3 units to x=7, up 4 units to y=5.\n\n- To (6,5): right 2 units to x=6, up 4 units to y=5.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,1) and (3,2), both requiring 3 moves: (1,1) is left 3, and (3,2) is left 1 and up 1.\n\nWait, moving left 1 and up 1 would be two moves, not three. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, in snake games, you move one step at a time. So, to get from (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n1. Move left to (3,1).\n\n2. Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,1):\n\n1. Move left to (3,1).\n\n2. Move left to (2,1).\n\n3. Move left to (1,1).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer, requiring only two moves, while (1,1) takes three moves.\n\nTherefore, it's faster to go for (3,2).\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1): empty.\n\n- Move up to (3,2): apple.\n\nLooks clear.\n\n- To (1,1):\n\n- Move left to (3,1): empty.\n\n- Move left to (2,1): empty.\n\n- Move left to (1,1): apple.\n\nAlso clear.\n\nBut since (3,2) is closer, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy is at (5,4), which is closer to the apples on row 5. So, if I go for (3,2), I can grab that apple quickly and then decide whether to go for another apple or head towards the ones on row 5.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), and my snake would grow by one unit.\n\nI need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail doesn't move forward, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), my snake will be longer, and I need to plan my path accordingly to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (3,2).\n\nSo, from (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1).\n\n- Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up first to (4,2) and then left to (3,2), but that would be the same number of moves.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Left to (3,1).\n\n2. Up to (3,2).\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Up to (4,2).\n\n2. Left to (3,2).\n\nBoth options take two moves.\n\nBut in Option 1, after moving left to (3,1), if the enemy moves down to (5,3), it might interfere, but right now, the enemy is at (5,4).\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern yet, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut since the enemy is on row 4, and I'm on row 1, it would take several moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5, so maybe it's better for me to grab (3,2) quickly and then decide.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can consider moving towards (1,1) or towards row 5.\n\nBut if I go towards row 5, I might compete with the enemy, who is already closer to those apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy's path to the row 5 apples by positioning my snake strategically.\n\nBut that might be risky, as I could get too close to the enemy and risk collision.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to grab (3,2), then move to (1,1), collecting another apple, and increasing my lead.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the situation and decide whether to go for the apples on row 5 or try to maneuver around the enemy.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious not to box myself into a corner while growing.\n\nSo, for now, my immediate goal is to move left towards (3,1), with the plan to then move up to (3,2) and eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can consider moving left to (2,1) and then to (1,1) for another apple.\n\nThis way, I'm collecting apples on the lower rows before the enemy can reach them.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements to anticipate its path.\n\nBut for this turn, I need to decide the next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (5,1). There are apples at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. Got it.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, meaning empty.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots with apples at columns 3,5,6,7.\n\nRow 4: dots with Snake #1 at column 5.\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: dots with an apple at column 3.\n\nRow 1: dots with an apple at column 1 and my snake at column 6.\n\nRow 0: all dots.\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,1), which is column 5, row 1. There's an apple at (1,1), which is column 1, row 1, so that's to the left of me. There's another apple at (3,2), which is column 3, row 2, so a bit up and left. Then there are multiple apples on row 5: (3,5), (7,5), (6,5).\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,4), which is directly above me, four rows up.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the proximity and also the potential paths to each apple without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,1). It's on the same row as me, row 1, and I'm at column 5. So, to get to column 1, I need to move left four times. But I need to check if there's anything in my way. Looking at row 1, it's all dots except for the apple at (1,1) and me at (5,1). So, it's clear.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (3,2), which is just one row up and two columns left from my current position. That might be a shorter path.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,1): left 4 units, same row.\n\n- To (3,2): left 2 units, up 1 unit.\n\n- To (3,5): left 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (7,5): right 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (6,5): right 1 unit, up 4 units.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,1) and (3,2), both requiring 3 moves: (1,1) is left 4, but since it's on the same row, it's actually just left 4; (3,2) is left 2 and up 1, total 3 moves.\n\nWait, movement is step by step, so left 2 and up 1 is 3 moves, while left 4 is 4 moves to (1,1). So (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at row 1: from (5,1) to (1,1), it's all dots in between, so clear path.\n\nTo (3,2): from (5,1), I can move left to (4,1), then up to (4,2), then left to (3,2). That's 3 moves, and looking at the board, row 2 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so clear.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so no issues.\n\nSo, both paths are clear.\n\nNow, which one to choose? If I go for (3,2), I gain a point and grow, then maybe proceed to another apple.\n\nAlternatively, going for (1,1) also gains a point and growth, but it's a bit further.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (5,4). It's directly above me at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to avoid colliding with it or its future positions.\n\nI don't know the enemy's movement yet, but I should assume it might move towards the apples as well.\n\nPerhaps I should try to reach an apple before the enemy does.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (5,4), it's closer to the apples on row 5 than I am.\n\nFrom (5,4) to, say, (3,5), it's left 2 and up 1, which is 3 moves.\n\nTo (7,5), it's right 2 and up 1, also 3 moves.\n\nTo (6,5), it's right 1 and up 1, 2 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5.\n\nWhereas I am closer to the apples at (1,1) and (3,2).\n\nSo, maybe I should go for (3,2) first, since it's closer and the enemy is also close to the row 5 apples.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), having grown, and then perhaps move towards (1,1) or consider the row 5 apples.\n\nBut, after eating (3,2), I would have to make sure not to run into the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go directly for (1,1), even though it's a bit further, to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is only one apple, while on row 5 there are three apples.\n\nIf I go for (1,1), I get one point, but the enemy might grab one or more from row 5.\n\nThen again, if I go for row 5, I might compete directly with the enemy.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for (3,2), which is closer, get that apple, grow, and then decide whether to go for another apple on row 5 or head towards (1,1).\n\nBut I need to consider the growth. When I eat an apple, my snake grows in length by one unit.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), I would have a longer snake, which could potentially block the enemy's path.\n\nBut I need to manage my tail's movement to avoid hitting it.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just choose to go for the closest apple, which is (3,2).\n\nSo, from (5,1) to (3,2):\n\nMove left to (4,1)\n\nThen up to (4,2)\n\nThen left to (3,2)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nBut in this game, I need to decide one move at a time.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut wait, the possible moves are just up, down, left, right, one step at a time.\n\nSo, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths to (3,2):\n\nPath 1:\n\nLeft to (4,1)\n\nUp to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\nUp to (5,2)\n\nLeft to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nWait, but moving up from (5,1) to (5,2) is possible, and then left twice to (3,2).\n\nSo, that's also three moves.\n\nComparing Path 1 and Path 2:\n\nPath 1:\n\n(5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\n(5,1) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nI need to see which path is safer.\n\nIn Path 1, moving left to (4,1) is safe, as it's empty.\n\nThen up to (4,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), which has an apple.\n\nIn Path 2, moving up to (5,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (4,2), empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), apple.\n\nBoth paths seem safe.\n\nBut in Path 1, after eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will be at (4,2), assuming I don't make any immediate turns.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your tail remains where it was, and you extend.\n\nWait, no, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you grow by not having your tail move on that turn.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nIn most snake games, each turn, the snake moves forward, and the tail moves forward unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail doesn't move forward, so your snake grows.\n\nSo, in this game, when I eat an apple, on the turn I eat it, my tail doesn't move"

I need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's list out all possible moves and see which one leads me closer to an apple without hitting walls or other snakes.\n\nPossible moves from (3,1):\n\n- Up: (3,2) \u2014 there's an apple there.\n\n- Down: (3,0) \u2014 that's within the board.\n\n- Left: (2,1) \u2014 within the board.\n\n- Right: (4,1) \u2014 within the board.\n\nNow, let's consider the consequences of each move.\n\n1. **Up to (3,2):**\n\n- There's an apple there, so I'll eat it, grow longer, and gain a point.\n\n- After eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that the next move doesn't hit my own tail.\n\n- Also, I need to plan the next few moves to see if I can continue moving safely.\n\n2. **Down to (3,0):**\n\n- There's no apple there.\n\n- It's empty, so I can move there safely, but there are no immediate rewards.\n\n- I'd be moving away from the apples on row 5, which might not be ideal.\n\n3. **Left to (2,1):**\n\n- It's empty.\n\n- Moving left could position me to go to (1,1), which has an apple.\n\n- But (1,1) is two moves away to the left from here.\n\n- However, I'd be moving away from the apple at (3,2), which is right above me.\n\n4. **Right to (4,1):**\n\n- It's empty.\n\n- Moving right would take me further away from the apples at (3,2) and (1,1).\n\n- There are apples on row 5, but I'd need to move up to get to them.\n\nConsidering these options, moving up to (3,2) seems attractive because there's an immediate apple there.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my snake will grow longer, so I need to make sure that my next move doesn't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nSuppose I move up to (3,2), eat the apple, and now my tail is still at its previous position.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move left or right, my tail will stay where it is because I've just eaten an apple.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail doesn't move forward, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), my snake will be longer, and I need to plan my path accordingly to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (3,2).\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat's one move.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,2), I could:\n\n- Move left to (2,2).\n\n- Move right to (4,2).\n\n- Move down to (3,1), but that's where my tail is, so it's safe since I've just eaten an apple and my tail hasn't moved yet.\n\nWait, no. After eating an apple, my tail doesn't move on the next turn, so moving down to (3,1) would be hitting my own tail, which is still there because it hasn't moved yet.\n\nWait, in most snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail stays in place because it's grown by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, moving down to (3,1) would be hitting your own tail, which is still there.\n\nTherefore, after eating (3,2), moving down to (3,1) is not safe; it's a collision with your own tail.\n\nSo, from (3,2), safe moves would be:\n\n- Left to (2,2).\n\n- Right to (4,2).\n\n- Up to (3,3), if there's nothing there.\n\nLooking at the board, row 3 is empty except for the apple at (3,2), so moving up to (3,3) is safe.\n\nBut there are apples on row 5, so maybe I should plan to move up towards them.\n\nAlternatively, I could move left to (2,2) and then continue to (1,2), but there are no apples there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (1,1), but that's diagonally down from (2,2).\n\nIt might be better to head towards the cluster of apples on row 5.\n\nSo, from (3,2), moving up to (3,3), then up to (3,4), and then up to (3,5) to eat another apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't already there.\n\nLooking back at the board, the enemy is at (5,6), which is on row 6, column 5.\n\nSo, it's higher up and to the right of my current position.\n\nIf I move up towards row 5, I might encounter the enemy if it's moving down.\n\nBut right now, the enemy is on row 6, and I'm on row 1, so it would take several moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5, so I need to consider whether to compete with it for those apples or focus on the ones closer to me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better for me to grab the apple at (3,2), then move up to (3,3), and then to (3,4), and finally to (3,5) to eat another apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (2,2), then to (1,2), and then down to (1,1) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut the apple at (1,1) is closer horizontally, but there are more apples on row 5 that are vertically above me.\n\nI need to balance between collecting nearby apples and potentially setting myself up for more opportunities.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is on row 6, it might be moving down towards row 5, where the cluster of apples is.\n\nIf that's the case, I need to decide whether to race it there or to secure the closer apple at (3,2) and then make a decision.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to secure the apple at (3,2) first, as it's the closest, and then assess the enemy's movement.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can consider moving up towards row 5 if it's safe, or to (1,1) if the enemy is moving towards row 5.\n\nBut for now, my immediate action should be to move up to (3,2).\n\nWait, but in my last move, I moved left to (3,1), with the plan to then move up to (3,2).\n\nBut now, I'm at (3,1), and I need to decide my next move.\n\nSo, should I move up to (3,2) now?\n\nWell, that seems logical.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (5,6), it's not immediately threatening me.\n\nMoreover, moving up to (3,2) is safe, as it's an apple, and after eating it, I can plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this turn is to move up to (3,2).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (5,1). There are apples at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. Got it.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, meaning empty.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots with apples at columns 3,5,6,7.\n\nRow 4: dots with Snake #1 at column 5.\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: dots with an apple at column 3.\n\nRow 1: dots with an apple at column 1 and my snake at column 6.\n\nRow 0: all dots.\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,1), which is column 5, row 1. There's an apple at (1,1), which is column 1, row 1, so that's to the left of me. There's another apple at (3,2), which is column 3, row 2, so a bit up and left. Then there are multiple apples on row 5: (3,5), (7,5), (6,5).\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,4), which is directly above me, four rows up.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the proximity and also the potential paths to each apple without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,1). It's on the same row as me, row 1, and I'm at column 5. So, to get to column 1, I need to move left four times. But I need to check if there's anything in my way. Looking at row 1, it's all dots except for the apple at (1,1) and me at (5,1). So, it's clear.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (3,2), which is just one row up and two columns left from my current position. That might be a shorter path.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,1): left 4 units, same row.\n\n- To (3,2): left 2 units, up 1 unit.\n\n- To (3,5): left 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (7,5): right 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (6,5): right 1 unit, up 4 units.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,1) and (3,2), both requiring 3 moves: (1,1) is left 4, but since it's on the same row, it's actually just left 4; (3,2) is left 2 and up 1, total 3 moves.\n\nWait, movement is step by step, so left 2 and up 1 is 3 moves, while left 4 is 4 moves to (1,1). So (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at row 1: from (5,1) to (1,1), it's all dots in between, so clear path.\n\nTo (3,2): from (5,1), I can move left to (4,1), then up to (4,2), then left to (3,2). That's 3 moves, and looking at the board, row 2 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so clear.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so no issues.\n\nSo, both paths are clear.\n\nNow, which one to choose? If I go for (3,2), I gain a point and grow, then maybe proceed to another apple.\n\nAlternatively, going for (1,1) also gains a point and growth, but it's a bit further.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (5,4). It's directly above me at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to avoid colliding with it or its future positions.\n\nI don't know the enemy's movement yet, but I should assume it might move towards the apples as well.\n\nPerhaps I should try to reach an apple before the enemy does.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (5,4), it's closer to the apples on row 5 than I am.\n\nFrom (5,4) to, say, (3,5), it's left 2 and up 1, which is 3 moves.\n\nTo (7,5), it's right 2 and up 1, also 3 moves.\n\nTo (6,5), it's right 1 and up 1, 2 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5.\n\nWhereas I am closer to the apples at (1,1) and (3,2).\n\nSo, maybe I should go for (3,2) first, since it's closer and the enemy is also close to the row 5 apples.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), having grown, and then perhaps move towards (1,1) or consider the row 5 apples.\n\nBut, after eating (3,2), I would have to make sure not to run into the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go directly for (1,1), even though it's a bit further, to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is only one apple, while on row 5 there are three apples.\n\nIf I go for (1,1), I get one point, but the enemy might grab one or more from row 5.\n\nThen again, if I go for row 5, I might compete directly with the enemy.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for (3,2), which is closer, get that apple, grow, and then decide whether to go for another apple on row 5 or head towards (1,1).\n\nBut I need to consider the growth. When I eat an apple, my snake grows in length by one unit.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), I would have a longer snake, which could potentially block the enemy's path.\n\nBut I need to manage my tail's movement to avoid hitting it.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just choose to go for the closest apple, which is (3,2).\n\nSo, from (5,1) to (3,2):\n\nMove left to (4,1)\n\nThen up to (4,2)\n\nThen left to (3,2)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nBut in this game, I need to decide one move at a time.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut wait, the possible moves are just up, down, left, right, one step at a time.\n\nSo, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths to (3,2):\n\nPath 1:\n\nLeft to (4,1)\n\nUp to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\nUp to (5,2)\n\nLeft to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nWait, but moving up from (5,1) to (5,2) is possible, and then left twice to (3,2).\n\nSo, that's also three moves.\n\nComparing Path 1 and Path 2:\n\nPath 1:\n\n(5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\n(5,1) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nI need to see which path is safer.\n\nIn Path 1, moving left to (4,1) is safe, as it's empty.\n\nThen up to (4,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), which has an apple.\n\nIn Path 2, moving up to (5,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (4,2), empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), apple.\n\nBoth paths seem safe.\n\nBut in Path 1, after eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will be at (4,2), assuming I don't make any immediate turns.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your tail remains where it was, and you extend.\n\nWait, no, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you grow by not having your tail move on that turn.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nIn most snake games, each turn, the snake moves forward, and the tail moves forward unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail doesn't move forward, so your snake grows.\n\nSo, in this game, when I eat an apple, on the turn I eat it, my tail doesn't move"

That means higher Y values are upwards, which is standard.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (4,1). There are apples at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,2).

Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, in snake games, you move one step at a time. So, to get from (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n1. Move left to (3,1).\n\n2. Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,1):\n\n1. Move left to (3,1).\n\n2. Move left to (2,1).\n\n3. Move left to (1,1).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer, requiring only two moves, while (1,1) takes three moves.\n\nTherefore, it's faster to go for (3,2).\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1): empty.\n\n- Move up to (3,2): apple.\n\nLooks clear.\n\n- To (1,1):\n\n- Move left to (3,1): empty.\n\n- Move left to (2,1): empty.\n\n- Move left to (1,1): apple.\n\nAlso clear.\n\nBut since (3,2) is closer, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy is at (5,4), which is closer to the apples on row 5. So, if I go for (3,2), I can grab that apple quickly and then decide whether to go for another apple or head towards the ones on row 5.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), and my snake would grow by one unit.\n\nI need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail doesn't move forward, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), my snake will be longer, and I need to plan my path accordingly to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (3,2).\n\nSo, from (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1).\n\n- Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up first to (4,2) and then left to (3,2), but that would be the same number of moves.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Left to (3,1).\n\n2. Up to (3,2).\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Up to (4,2).\n\n2. Left to (3,2).\n\nBoth options take two moves.\n\nBut in Option 1, after moving left to (3,1), if the enemy moves down to (5,3), it might interfere, but right now, the enemy is at (5,4).\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern yet, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut since the enemy is on row 4, and I'm on row 1, it would take several moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5, so maybe it's better for me to grab (3,2) quickly and then decide.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can consider moving towards (1,1) or towards row 5.\n\nBut if I go towards row 5, I might compete with the enemy, who is already closer to those apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy's path to the row 5 apples by positioning my snake strategically.\n\nBut that might be risky, as I could get too close to the enemy and risk collision.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to grab (3,2), then move to (1,1), collecting another apple, and increasing my lead.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the situation and decide whether to go for the apples on row 5 or try to maneuver around the enemy.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious not to box myself into a corner while growing.\n\nSo, for now, my immediate goal is to move left towards (3,1), with the plan to then move up to (3,2) and eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can consider moving left to (2,1) and then to (1,1) for another apple.\n\nThis way, I'm collecting apples on the lower rows before the enemy can reach them.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements to anticipate its path.\n\nBut for this turn, I need to decide the next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

I need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's list out all possible moves and see which one leads me closer to an apple without hitting walls or other snakes.\n\nPossible moves from (3,1):\n\n- Up: (3,2) \u2014 there's an apple there.\n\n- Down: (3,0) \u2014 that's within the board.\n\n- Left: (2,1) \u2014 within the board.\n\n- Right: (4,1) \u2014 within the board.\n\nNow, let's consider the consequences of each move.\n\n1. **Up to (3,2):**\n\n- There's an apple there, so I'll eat it, grow longer, and gain a point.\n\n- After eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that the next move doesn't hit my own tail.\n\n- Also, I need to plan the next few moves to see if I can continue moving safely.\n\n2. **Down to (3,0):**\n\n- There's no apple there.\n\n- It's empty, so I can move there safely, but there are no immediate rewards.\n\n- I'd be moving away from the apples on row 5, which might not be ideal.\n\n3. **Left to (2,1):**\n\n- It's empty.\n\n- Moving left could position me to go to (1,1), which has an apple.\n\n- But (1,1) is two moves away to the left from here.\n\n- However, I'd be moving away from the apple at (3,2), which is right above me.\n\n4. **Right to (4,1):**\n\n- It's empty.\n\n- Moving right would take me further away from the apples at (3,2) and (1,1).\n\n- There are apples on row 5, but I'd need to move up to get to them.\n\nConsidering these options, moving up to (3,2) seems attractive because there's an immediate apple there.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my snake will grow longer, so I need to make sure that my next move doesn't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nSuppose I move up to (3,2), eat the apple, and now my tail is still at its previous position.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move left or right, my tail will stay where it is because I've just eaten an apple.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail doesn't move forward, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), my snake will be longer, and I need to plan my path accordingly to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (3,2).\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat's one move.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,2), I could:\n\n- Move left to (2,2).\n\n- Move right to (4,2).\n\n- Move down to (3,1), but that's where my tail is, so it's safe since I've just eaten an apple and my tail hasn't moved yet.\n\nWait, no. After eating an apple, my tail doesn't move on the next turn, so moving down to (3,1) would be hitting my own tail, which is still there because it hasn't moved yet.\n\nWait, in most snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail stays in place because it's grown by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, moving down to (3,1) would be hitting your own tail, which is still there.\n\nTherefore, after eating (3,2), moving down to (3,1) is not safe; it's a collision with your own tail.\n\nSo, from (3,2), safe moves would be:\n\n- Left to (2,2).\n\n- Right to (4,2).\n\n- Up to (3,3), if there's nothing there.\n\nLooking at the board, row 3 is empty except for the apple at (3,2), so moving up to (3,3) is safe.\n\nBut there are apples on row 5, so maybe I should plan to move up towards them.\n\nAlternatively, I could move left to (2,2) and then continue to (1,2), but there are no apples there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (1,1), but that's diagonally down from (2,2).\n\nIt might be better to head towards the cluster of apples on row 5.\n\nSo, from (3,2), moving up to (3,3), then up to (3,4), and then up to (3,5) to eat another apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't already there.\n\nLooking back at the board, the enemy is at (5,6), which is on row 6, column 5.\n\nSo, it's higher up and to the right of my current position.\n\nIf I move up towards row 5, I might encounter the enemy if it's moving down.\n\nBut right now, the enemy is on row 6, and I'm on row 1, so it would take several moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5, so I need to consider whether to compete with it for those apples or focus on the ones closer to me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better for me to grab the apple at (3,2), then move up to (3,3), and then to (3,4), and finally to (3,5) to eat another apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (2,2), then to (1,2), and then down to (1,1) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut the apple at (1,1) is closer horizontally, but there are more apples on row 5 that are vertically above me.\n\nI need to balance between collecting nearby apples and potentially setting myself up for more opportunities.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is on row 6, it might be moving down towards row 5, where the cluster of apples is.\n\nIf that's the case, I need to decide whether to race it there or to secure the closer apple at (3,2) and then make a decision.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to secure the apple at (3,2) first, as it's the closest, and then assess the enemy's movement.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can consider moving up towards row 5 if it's safe, or to (1,1) if the enemy is moving towards row 5.\n\nBut for now, my immediate action should be to move up to (3,2).\n\nWait, but in my last move, I moved left to (3,1), with the plan to then move up to (3,2).\n\nBut now, I'm at (3,1), and I need to decide my next move.\n\nSo, should I move up to (3,2) now?\n\nWell, that seems logical.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (5,6), it's not immediately threatening me.\n\nMoreover, moving up to (3,2) is safe, as it's an apple, and after eating it, I can plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this turn is to move up to (3,2).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (5,1). There are apples at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. Got it.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, meaning empty.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots with apples at columns 3,5,6,7.\n\nRow 4: dots with Snake #1 at column 5.\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: dots with an apple at column 3.\n\nRow 1: dots with an apple at column 1 and my snake at column 6.\n\nRow 0: all dots.\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,1), which is column 5, row 1. There's an apple at (1,1), which is column 1, row 1, so that's to the left of me. There's another apple at (3,2), which is column 3, row 2, so a bit up and left. Then there are multiple apples on row 5: (3,5), (7,5), (6,5).\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,4), which is directly above me, four rows up.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the proximity and also the potential paths to each apple without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,1). It's on the same row as me, row 1, and I'm at column 5. So, to get to column 1, I need to move left four times. But I need to check if there's anything in my way. Looking at row 1, it's all dots except for the apple at (1,1) and me at (5,1). So, it's clear.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (3,2), which is just one row up and two columns left from my current position. That might be a shorter path.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,1): left 4 units, same row.\n\n- To (3,2): left 2 units, up 1 unit.\n\n- To (3,5): left 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (7,5): right 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (6,5): right 1 unit, up 4 units.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,1) and (3,2), both requiring 3 moves: (1,1) is left 4, but since it's on the same row, it's actually just left 4; (3,2) is left 2 and up 1, total 3 moves.\n\nWait, movement is step by step, so left 2 and up 1 is 3 moves, while left 4 is 4 moves to (1,1). So (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at row 1: from (5,1) to (1,1), it's all dots in between, so clear path.\n\nTo (3,2): from (5,1), I can move left to (4,1), then up to (4,2), then left to (3,2). That's 3 moves, and looking at the board, row 2 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so clear.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so no issues.\n\nSo, both paths are clear.\n\nNow, which one to choose? If I go for (3,2), I gain a point and grow, then maybe proceed to another apple.\n\nAlternatively, going for (1,1) also gains a point and growth, but it's a bit further.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (5,4). It's directly above me at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to avoid colliding with it or its future positions.\n\nI don't know the enemy's movement yet, but I should assume it might move towards the apples as well.\n\nPerhaps I should try to reach an apple before the enemy does.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (5,4), it's closer to the apples on row 5 than I am.\n\nFrom (5,4) to, say, (3,5), it's left 2 and up 1, which is 3 moves.\n\nTo (7,5), it's right 2 and up 1, also 3 moves.\n\nTo (6,5), it's right 1 and up 1, 2 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5.\n\nWhereas I am closer to the apples at (1,1) and (3,2).\n\nSo, maybe I should go for (3,2) first, since it's closer and the enemy is also close to the row 5 apples.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), having grown, and then perhaps move towards (1,1) or consider the row 5 apples.\n\nBut, after eating (3,2), I would have to make sure not to run into the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go directly for (1,1), even though it's a bit further, to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is only one apple, while on row 5 there are three apples.\n\nIf I go for (1,1), I get one point, but the enemy might grab one or more from row 5.\n\nThen again, if I go for row 5, I might compete directly with the enemy.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for (3,2), which is closer, get that apple, grow, and then decide whether to go for another apple on row 5 or head towards (1,1).\n\nBut I need to consider the growth. When I eat an apple, my snake grows in length by one unit.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), I would have a longer snake, which could potentially block the enemy's path.\n\nBut I need to manage my tail's movement to avoid hitting it.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just choose to go for the closest apple, which is (3,2).\n\nSo, from (5,1) to (3,2):\n\nMove left to (4,1)\n\nThen up to (4,2)\n\nThen left to (3,2)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nBut in this game, I need to decide one move at a time.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut wait, the possible moves are just up, down, left, right, one step at a time.\n\nSo, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths to (3,2):\n\nPath 1:\n\nLeft to (4,1)\n\nUp to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\nUp to (5,2)\n\nLeft to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nWait, but moving up from (5,1) to (5,2) is possible, and then left twice to (3,2).\n\nSo, that's also three moves.\n\nComparing Path 1 and Path 2:\n\nPath 1:\n\n(5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\n(5,1) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nI need to see which path is safer.\n\nIn Path 1, moving left to (4,1) is safe, as it's empty.\n\nThen up to (4,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), which has an apple.\n\nIn Path 2, moving up to (5,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (4,2), empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), apple.\n\nBoth paths seem safe.\n\nBut in Path 1, after eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will be at (4,2), assuming I don't make any immediate turns.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your tail remains where it was, and you extend.\n\nWait, no, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you grow by not having your tail move on that turn.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nIn most snake games, each turn, the snake moves forward, and the tail moves forward unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail doesn't move forward, so your snake grows.\n\nSo, in this game, when I eat an apple, on the turn I eat it, my tail doesn't move"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, which is standard.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (4,1). There are apples at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,2). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,5), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9 to Row 0, with Row 9 being the top.\n\n- Apples are at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), (3,2).\n\n- My snake is at (4,1).\n\n- Enemy snake is at (5,4).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple at (1,1), which is left on the same row, or the one at (3,2), which is a bit up and left, or maybe aim for the apples on row 5.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (5,4), which is directly above me, I might want to avoid getting too close to it, especially since it could be moving towards the apples on row 5.\n\nLet me think about the distances:\n\n- To (1,1): left 3 units (from x=4 to x=1, y remains 1).\n\n- To (3,2): left 1 unit to x=3, up 1 unit to y=2.\n\n- To (3,5): left 1 unit to x=3, up 4 units to y=5.\n\n- To (7,5): right 3 units to x=7, up 4 units to y=5.\n\n- To (6,5): right 2 units to x=6, up 4 units to y=5.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,1) and (3,2), both requiring 3 moves: (1,1) is left 3, and (3,2) is left 1 and up 1.\n\nWait, moving left 1 and up 1 would be two moves, not three. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, in snake games, you move one step at a time. So, to get from (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n1. Move left to (3,1).\n\n2. Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,1):\n\n1. Move left to (3,1).\n\n2. Move left to (2,1).\n\n3. Move left to (1,1).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer, requiring only two moves, while (1,1) takes three moves.\n\nTherefore, it's faster to go for (3,2).\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1): empty.\n\n- Move up to (3,2): apple.\n\nLooks clear.\n\n- To (1,1):\n\n- Move left to (3,1): empty.\n\n- Move left to (2,1): empty.\n\n- Move left to (1,1): apple.\n\nAlso clear.\n\nBut since (3,2) is closer, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy is at (5,4), which is closer to the apples on row 5. So, if I go for (3,2), I can grab that apple quickly and then decide whether to go for another apple or head towards the ones on row 5.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), and my snake would grow by one unit.\n\nI need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail doesn't move forward, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), my snake will be longer, and I need to plan my path accordingly to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (3,2).\n\nSo, from (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1).\n\n- Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up first to (4,2) and then left to (3,2), but that would be the same number of moves.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Left to (3,1).\n\n2. Up to (3,2).\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Up to (4,2).\n\n2. Left to (3,2).\n\nBoth options take two moves.\n\nBut in Option 1, after moving left to (3,1), if the enemy moves down to (5,3), it might interfere, but right now, the enemy is at (5,4).\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern yet, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut since the enemy is on row 4, and I'm on row 1, it would take several moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5, so maybe it's better for me to grab (3,2) quickly and then decide.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can consider moving towards (1,1) or towards row 5.\n\nBut if I go towards row 5, I might compete with the enemy, who is already closer to those apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy's path to the row 5 apples by positioning my snake strategically.\n\nBut that might be risky, as I could get too close to the enemy and risk collision.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to grab (3,2), then move to (1,1), collecting another apple, and increasing my lead.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the situation and decide whether to go for the apples on row 5 or try to maneuver around the enemy.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious not to box myself into a corner while growing.\n\nSo, for now, my immediate goal is to move left towards (3,1), with the plan to then move up to (3,2) and eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can consider moving left to (2,1) and then to (1,1) for another apple.\n\nThis way, I'm collecting apples on the lower rows before the enemy can reach them.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements to anticipate its path.\n\nBut for this turn, I need to decide the next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

It's quite a distance.\n\n- The enemy is also to the right and up, so moving right might bring me closer to it.\n\nConsidering these options, moving down to (3,2) seems attractive because there's an immediate apple there.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my snake will grow longer, so I need to make sure that my next move doesn't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nSuppose I move down to (3,2), eat the apple, and now my tail is still at its previous position.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move left or right, my tail will stay where it is because I've just eaten an apple.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail doesn't move forward, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), my snake will be longer, and I need to plan my path accordingly to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (3,2).\n\nSo, from (3,3) to (3,2):\n\n- Move down to (3,2).\n\nThat's one move.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,2), I could:\n\n- Move left to (2,2).\n\n- Move right to (4,2).\n\n- Move up to (3,3), but that's where my tail is, so it's safe since I've just eaten an apple and my tail hasn't moved yet.\n\nWait, no. After eating an apple, my tail grows, meaning the tail segment remains in place, so moving up to (3,3) would be hitting my own tail.\n\nTherefore, after eating (3,2), moving up to (3,3) is not safe; it's a collision with my own tail.\n\nSo, from (3,2), safe moves would be:\n\n- Left to (2,2).\n\n- Right to (4,2).\n\n- Down to (3,1), if there's nothing there.\n\nLooking at the board, row 3 is empty except for the apple at (3,2), so moving down to (3,1) is safe.\n\nBut there's an apple at (1,1), which is further down and to the left.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (2,2) and then to (1,2) could lead me to (1,1).\n\nBut, I also have apples on row 5, at (3,5), (7,5), and (6,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to head towards the cluster of apples on row 5.\n\nIf I move up from (3,3) to (3,4), then to (3,5), I can eat another apple there.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider moving right or left along row 5 to get to (6,5) or (7,5).\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy at (5,8), which is on row 8, column 5.\n\nIf I move up towards row 5, I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I move down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), then (1,2), and then down to (1,1), I can pick up another apple.\n\nThis path takes me away from the enemy, which is currently on row 8.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf the enemy is moving down towards row 5, where the cluster of apples is, I might have less competition if I go for the apples closer to me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to secure the apple at (3,2), then move left to (2,2), then down to (1,2), and then to (1,1) to eat another apple.\n\nThis way, I'm collecting apples without getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, by moving down and left, I'm exploring areas that are less likely to be contested by the enemy, which is higher up.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move down to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n\n1. If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2. If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n\n3. The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\n\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\n\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\n\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\n\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (5,1). There are apples at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. Got it.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, meaning empty.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: dots with apples at columns 3,5,6,7.\n\nRow 4: dots with Snake #1 at column 5.\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: dots with an apple at column 3.\n\nRow 1: dots with an apple at column 1 and my snake at column 6.\n\nRow 0: all dots.\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,1), which is column 5, row 1. There's an apple at (1,1), which is column 1, row 1, so that's to the left of me. There's another apple at (3,2), which is column 3, row 2, so a bit up and left. Then there are multiple apples on row 5: (3,5), (7,5), (6,5).\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,4), which is directly above me, four rows up.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the proximity and also the potential paths to each apple without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,1). It's on the same row as me, row 1, and I'm at column 5. So, to get to column 1, I need to move left four times. But I need to check if there's anything in my way. Looking at row 1, it's all dots except for the apple at (1,1) and me at (5,1). So, it's clear.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (3,2), which is just one row up and two columns left from my current position. That might be a shorter path.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,1): left 4 units, same row.\n\n- To (3,2): left 2 units, up 1 unit.\n\n- To (3,5): left 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (7,5): right 2 units, up 4 units.\n\n- To (6,5): right 1 unit, up 4 units.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,1) and (3,2), both requiring 3 moves: (1,1) is left 4, but since it's on the same row, it's actually just left 4; (3,2) is left 2 and up 1, total 3 moves.\n\nWait, movement is step by step, so left 2 and up 1 is 3 moves, while left 4 is 4 moves to (1,1). So (3,2) is closer.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at row 1: from (5,1) to (1,1), it's all dots in between, so clear path.\n\nTo (3,2): from (5,1), I can move left to (4,1), then up to (4,2), then left to (3,2). That's 3 moves, and looking at the board, row 2 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so clear.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 at columns 3 and 4 are dots, so no issues.\n\nSo, both paths are clear.\n\nNow, which one to choose? If I go for (3,2), I gain a point and grow, then maybe proceed to another apple.\n\nAlternatively, going for (1,1) also gains a point and growth, but it's a bit further.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (5,4). It's directly above me at (5,4), and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to avoid colliding with it or its future positions.\n\nI don't know the enemy's movement yet, but I should assume it might move towards the apples as well.\n\nPerhaps I should try to reach an apple before the enemy does.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (5,4), it's closer to the apples on row 5 than I am.\n\nFrom (5,4) to, say, (3,5), it's left 2 and up 1, which is 3 moves.\n\nTo (7,5), it's right 2 and up 1, also 3 moves.\n\nTo (6,5), it's right 1 and up 1, 2 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5.\n\nWhereas I am closer to the apples at (1,1) and (3,2).\n\nSo, maybe I should go for (3,2) first, since it's closer and the enemy is also close to the row 5 apples.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), having grown, and then perhaps move towards (1,1) or consider the row 5 apples.\n\nBut, after eating (3,2), I would have to make sure not to run into the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go directly for (1,1), even though it's a bit further, to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is only one apple, while on row 5 there are three apples.\n\nIf I go for (1,1), I get one point, but the enemy might grab one or more from row 5.\n\nThen again, if I go for row 5, I might compete directly with the enemy.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for (3,2), which is closer, get that apple, grow, and then decide whether to go for another apple on row 5 or head towards (1,1).\n\nBut I need to consider the growth. When I eat an apple, my snake grows in length by one unit.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), I would have a longer snake, which could potentially block the enemy's path.\n\nBut I need to manage my tail's movement to avoid hitting it.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just choose to go for the closest apple, which is (3,2).\n\nSo, from (5,1) to (3,2):\n\nMove left to (4,1)\n\nThen up to (4,2)\n\nThen left to (3,2)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nBut in this game, I need to decide one move at a time.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut wait, the possible moves are just up, down, left, right, one step at a time.\n\nSo, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths to (3,2):\n\nPath 1:\n\nLeft to (4,1)\n\nUp to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\nUp to (5,2)\n\nLeft to (4,2)\n\nLeft to (3,2)\n\nWait, but moving up from (5,1) to (5,2) is possible, and then left twice to (3,2).\n\nSo, that's also three moves.\n\nComparing Path 1 and Path 2:\n\nPath 1:\n\n(5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nPath 2:\n\n(5,1) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nI need to see which path is safer.\n\nIn Path 1, moving left to (4,1) is safe, as it's empty.\n\nThen up to (4,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), which has an apple.\n\nIn Path 2, moving up to (5,2), which is empty.\n\nThen left to (4,2), empty.\n\nThen left to (3,2), apple.\n\nBoth paths seem safe.\n\nBut in Path 1, after eating the apple at (3,2), my tail will be at (4,2), assuming I don't make any immediate turns.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your tail remains where it was, and you extend.\n\nWait, no, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you grow by not having your tail move on that turn.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nIn most snake games, each turn, the snake moves forward, and the tail moves forward unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail doesn't move forward, so your snake grows.\n\nSo, in this game, when I eat an apple, on the turn I eat it, my tail doesn't move"

That means higher Y values are upwards, which is standard.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, currently at (4,1). There are apples at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,2).

Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, in snake games, you move one step at a time. So, to get from (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n1. Move left to (3,1).\n\n2. Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,1):\n\n1. Move left to (3,1).\n\n2. Move left to (2,1).\n\n3. Move left to (1,1).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nSo, (3,2) is closer, requiring only two moves, while (1,1) takes three moves.\n\nTherefore, it's faster to go for (3,2).\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles between me and these apples.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1): empty.\n\n- Move up to (3,2): apple.\n\nLooks clear.\n\n- To (1,1):\n\n- Move left to (3,1): empty.\n\n- Move left to (2,1): empty.\n\n- Move left to (1,1): apple.\n\nAlso clear.\n\nBut since (3,2) is closer, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy is at (5,4), which is closer to the apples on row 5. So, if I go for (3,2), I can grab that apple quickly and then decide whether to go for another apple or head towards the ones on row 5.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I would be at (3,2), and my snake would grow by one unit.\n\nI need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail doesn't move forward, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), my snake will be longer, and I need to plan my path accordingly to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (3,2).\n\nSo, from (4,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1).\n\n- Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up first to (4,2) and then left to (3,2), but that would be the same number of moves.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Left to (3,1).\n\n2. Up to (3,2).\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Up to (4,2).\n\n2. Left to (3,2).\n\nBoth options take two moves.\n\nBut in Option 1, after moving left to (3,1), if the enemy moves down to (5,3), it might interfere, but right now, the enemy is at (5,4).\n\nWait, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern yet, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut since the enemy is on row 4, and I'm on row 1, it would take several moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5, so maybe it's better for me to grab (3,2) quickly and then decide.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can consider moving towards (1,1) or towards row 5.\n\nBut if I go towards row 5, I might compete with the enemy, who is already closer to those apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to block the enemy's path to the row 5 apples by positioning my snake strategically.\n\nBut that might be risky, as I could get too close to the enemy and risk collision.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to grab (3,2), then move to (1,1), collecting another apple, and increasing my lead.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the situation and decide whether to go for the apples on row 5 or try to maneuver around the enemy.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious not to box myself into a corner while growing.\n\nSo, for now, my immediate goal is to move left towards (3,1), with the plan to then move up to (3,2) and eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can consider moving left to (2,1) and then to (1,1) for another apple.\n\nThis way, I'm collecting apples on the lower rows before the enemy can reach them.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements to anticipate its path.\n\nBut for this turn, I need to decide the next move.\n\nGiven that, I should move left to (3,1).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

I need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's list out all possible moves and see which one leads me closer to an apple without hitting walls or other snakes.\n\nPossible moves from (3,1):\n\n- Up: (3,2) \u2014 there's an apple there.\n\n- Down: (3,0) \u2014 that's within the board.\n\n- Left: (2,1) \u2014 within the board.\n\n- Right: (4,1) \u2014 within the board.\n\nNow, let's consider the consequences of each move.\n\n1. **Up to (3,2):**\n\n- There's an apple there, so I'll eat it, grow longer, and gain a point.\n\n- After eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that the next move doesn't hit my own tail.\n\n- Also, I need to plan the next few moves to see if I can continue moving safely.\n\n2. **Down to (3,0):**\n\n- There's no apple there.\n\n- It's empty, so I can move there safely, but there are no immediate rewards.\n\n- I'd be moving away from the apples on row 5, which might not be ideal.\n\n3. **Left to (2,1):**\n\n- It's empty.\n\n- Moving left could position me to go to (1,1), which has an apple.\n\n- But (1,1) is two moves away to the left from here.\n\n- However, I'd be moving away from the apple at (3,2), which is right above me.\n\n4. **Right to (4,1):**\n\n- It's empty.\n\n- Moving right would take me further away from the apples at (3,2) and (1,1).\n\n- There are apples on row 5, but I'd need to move up to get to them.\n\nConsidering these options, moving up to (3,2) seems attractive because there's an immediate apple there.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), my snake will grow longer, so I need to make sure that my next move doesn't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nSuppose I move up to (3,2), eat the apple, and now my tail is still at its previous position.\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move left or right, my tail will stay where it is because I've just eaten an apple.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail doesn't move forward, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, after eating (3,2), my snake will be longer, and I need to plan my path accordingly to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (3,2).\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,2):\n\n- Move up to (3,2).\n\nThat's one move.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,2), I could:\n\n- Move left to (2,2).\n\n- Move right to (4,2).\n\n- Move down to (3,1), but that's where my tail is, so it's safe since I've just eaten an apple and my tail hasn't moved yet.\n\nWait, no. After eating an apple, my tail doesn't move on the next turn, so moving down to (3,1) would be hitting my own tail, which is still there because it hasn't moved yet.\n\nWait, in most snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the next move, your tail stays in place because it's grown by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, moving down to (3,1) would be hitting your own tail, which is still there.\n\nTherefore, after eating (3,2), moving down to (3,1) is not safe; it's a collision with your own tail.\n\nSo, from (3,2), safe moves would be:\n\n- Left to (2,2).\n\n- Right to (4,2).\n\n- Up to (3,3), if there's nothing there.\n\nLooking at the board, row 3 is empty except for the apple at (3,2), so moving up to (3,3) is safe.\n\nBut there are apples on row 5, so maybe I should plan to move up towards them.\n\nAlternatively, I could move left to (2,2) and then continue to (1,2), but there are no apples there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (1,1), but that's diagonally down from (2,2).\n\nIt might be better to head towards the cluster of apples on row 5.\n\nSo, from (3,2), moving up to (3,3), then up to (3,4), and then up to (3,5) to eat another apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't already there.\n\nLooking back at the board, the enemy is at (5,6), which is on row 6, column 5.\n\nSo, it's higher up and to the right of my current position.\n\nIf I move up towards row 5, I might encounter the enemy if it's moving down.\n\nBut right now, the enemy is on row 6, and I'm on row 1, so it would take several moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is closer to the apples on row 5, so I need to consider whether to compete with it for those apples or focus on the ones closer to me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better for me to grab the apple at (3,2), then move up to (3,3), and then to (3,4), and finally to (3,5) to eat another apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (2,2), then to (1,2), and then down to (1,1) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut the apple at (1,1) is closer horizontally, but there are more apples on row 5 that are vertically above me.\n\nI need to balance between collecting nearby apples and potentially setting myself up for more opportunities.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is on row 6, it might be moving down towards row 5, where the cluster of apples is.\n\nIf that's the case, I need to decide whether to race it there or to secure the closer apple at (3,2) and then make a decision.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to secure the apple at (3,2) first, as it's the closest, and then assess the enemy's movement.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can consider moving up towards row 5 if it's safe, or to (1,1) if the enemy is moving towards row 5.\n\nBut for now, my immediate action should be to move up to (3,2).\n\nWait, but in my last move, I moved left to (3,1), with the plan to then move up to (3,2).\n\nBut now, I'm at (3,1), and I need to decide my next move.\n\nSo, should I move up to (3,2) now?\n\nWell, that seems logical.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (5,6), it's not immediately threatening me.\n\nMoreover, moving up to (3,2) is safe, as it's an apple, and after eating it, I can plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this turn is to move up to (3,2).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

It's quite a distance.\n\n- The enemy is also to the right and up, so moving right might bring me closer to it.\n\nConsidering these options, moving up to (3,4) seems like the most direct path to an apple.\n\nLet's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,5), I could move right to (4,5), then to (5,5), and so on towards (6,5) and (7,5).\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy at (5,9).\n\nIf the enemy moves down towards row 5, I might have to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (2,3), then to (1,3), and then down to (1,2), and finally to (1,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThis path takes me away from the enemy, which is currently on row 9.\n\nBut the apple at (1,1) is farther compared to the one at (3,5).\n\nI need to balance between collecting apples quickly and avoiding the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closer apple at (3,5).\n\nSo, from (3,3), up to (3,4), then up to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider moving right to (4,5), then to (5,5), and so on towards (6,5) and (7,5).\n\nBut I need to keep an eye on the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (3,5), I could move left to (3,6), but there's an apple at (3,7). Wait, no, apples are at (3,5), (7,5), (1,1), (6,5), and (3,7).\n\nWait, (3,7) is another apple.\n\nSo, after eating (3,5), I could move up to (3,6), then to (3,7) to eat another apple.\n\nBut the enemy is at (5,9), which is on row 9, column 5.\n\nIf I move up towards row 7, I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (3,5), I could move right to (4,5), then to (5,5), (6,5), and eat the apple at (6,5), then continue to (7,5) to eat another apple.\n\nThis would allow me to collect multiple apples in one path.\n\nBut again, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movement.\n\nConsidering the potential risks and rewards, perhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (1,1), which is farther but away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, it would take more moves to reach, and I might miss out on the closer apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the cluster of apples at (3,5), (6,5), and (7,5), while keeping an eye on the enemy's position.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best strategy is to prioritize the closest apples first, starting with (3,5), then moving to (6,5) and (7,5), while avoiding the enemy.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (3,4).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n\n1.
