If I move to (8, 1), I'll be quite close to that snake, so I should be careful not to run into it on future moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (8, 5) to eat the apple, I should try to move towards the other nearby apples at (7, 8) and (7, 5) while avoiding the other snake.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

There's also an enemy snake at position (9, 1), but it's not a direct threat at the moment.\n\nOur goal is to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls. Since the closest apple is above us, our best move would be to move up.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and be prepared to change direction if necessary. Also, consider the possibility of moving left or right to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nNext move: UP"
