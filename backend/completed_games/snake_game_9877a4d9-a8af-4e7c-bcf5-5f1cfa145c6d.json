That gives me an indication to stay clear of the right side, especially the area closer to their tail. \n\n### Long-term Strategy\nAfter the next position analysis, I\u2019ll focus on:\n- Ensuring that I stay away from the enemy snake.\n- Keeping track of movement options towards the apples, especially orienting myself toward (1, 5) or (0, 3) in future turns.\n- Avoiding regression and ensuring each move remains strategic for accumulating points.\n\nDecided next move: **UP** to (2, 4)."
