The other apples at (8,7) and (0,9) might also become potential targets based on their relative distance post obtaining the apple at (3, 6).\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (1, 5) and doesn't immediately threaten my next few intended moves, as my path doesn't intersect with theirs for now.\n\nThus, my next step should indeed be to move LEFT to secure the apple at (3, 6), continuing to monitor the positional shifts of both my snake and snake #2.\n\nTo strategize for future moves:\n1. After taking the apple at (3, 6), evaluate the feasibility of navigating toward (5, 2) while maintaining a safe distance from both edges and the enemy snake.\n2.
