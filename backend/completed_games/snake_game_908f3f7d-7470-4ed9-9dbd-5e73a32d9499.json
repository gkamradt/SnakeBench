            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,4). The apples are at (1,6), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4), (5,5). The enemy snake is at (8,2) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head. The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). My last move was none, so this is the starting position.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible directions. From (9,4), possible moves are UP to (9,5), DOWN to (9,3), LEFT to (8,4), or RIGHT which would be (10,4) but that's out of bounds. So RIGHT is invalid. So options are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLooking at apples: The closest ones are (5,5) which is a bit far. The others are on the left side. (1,6) is up and left, (0,2) is down and left. (1,3) and (1,4) are also left but lower. Since I'm at (9,4), moving left towards column 8,7, etc. might get me closer to those apples. But need to check the path.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,4), that's safe. Then from there, maybe continue left towards the apples. But the enemy snake is at (8,2). So if I go left, I can start moving towards the middle where the apples are. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. But maybe the apples on the left are easier to reach first.\n\nWait, the apples at (1,3) and (1,4) are in column 1, rows 3 and 4. So if I go left, I can start moving towards column 8,7,6... but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is closer. Let's calculate the distance. From (9,4) to (5,5): that's 4 steps left and 1 up. So if I go left a few times and then up. But the enemy snake is at (8,2), which is two rows down from (8,2). So if I go left to (8,4), then next move could be left again to (7,4), then (6,4), etc. But maybe the apple at (5,5) is better. Alternatively, maybe the apple at (1,6) is up and left. But that's even further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going UP to (9,5) would get me closer to (5,5). From (9,5), then left towards (5,5). But that's a path. But moving up first might be a good idea. Let's see: from (9,4), UP to (9,5). Then next move could be LEFT to (8,5), then (7,5), etc. until reaching (5,5). That's 4 moves left. But the apple at (5,5) is in the same row as (9,5) if I go up once. Wait, (5,5) is at y=5. So if I go up to (9,5), then moving left towards (5,5) would take 4 steps. But each step left would get me closer. Alternatively, if I go LEFT first, then up. Let's see: from (9,4), LEFT to (8,4), then UP to (8,5), then left to (7,5), etc. That's also possible. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to avoid the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,2). So if I go left to (8,4), that's two rows above the enemy. So that's safe. Then moving left again to (7,4), etc. But maybe the enemy is moving towards me? Not sure. Since the enemy's body is empty, maybe it's just starting out. So perhaps it's not a threat yet.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (9,3). Then maybe towards the apple at (1,3) or (1,4). But (1,3) is at y=3, so from (9,3), moving left. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about possible risks. If I go UP to (9,5), then next move could be LEFT. But is there any apple in that path? The apple at (5,5) is in that row. So moving left from (9,5) towards (5,5) would collect that apple. But that's 4 steps left. Each step left would take me closer. But each step left would also be safe as long as I don't hit any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (8,2), which is not in that path. So that seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT to (8,4), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,4), then (6,4), etc. But the apples in the left columns (1,3), (1,4) are in y=3 and 4. So if I go left to (8,4), then down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), etc., but that's a longer path. Maybe not as efficient.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go UP first to (9,5), then start moving left towards (5,5). That way, I can collect the apple at (5,5) in 4 moves. Also, moving up first would avoid the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (8,2), which is far from (9,5). So that's safer.\n\nBut wait, what's the risk of going UP? If I go UP to (9,5), is there any immediate danger? The board shows that at (9,4) is my head. The next cell up is (9,5), which is empty. So that's safe. Then moving left from there. So that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT to (8,4), that's also safe. Then from there, I can go up to (8,5) and then left towards (5,5). But that's the same number of steps as going up first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So if I can reach it, that's a point. But there are other apples as well. Maybe the apple at (1,6) is another target. But that's even further. So perhaps the apple at (5,5) is the closest one.\n\nSo the plan is to go UP to (9,5), then LEFT towards (5,5). That would collect the apple at (5,5) after moving left four times. Each step left would be safe as long as there's no enemy in the way. The enemy is at (8,2), which is not in that path. So that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT first, then UP, but that might take the same number of steps. Let's see: from (9,4) to (8,4) (LEFT), then UP to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), etc. That's also 4 steps left from (8,5) to (5,5). So same number of steps. But maybe going UP first is better because it's a straight path.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,2). If I go LEFT to (8,4), then the enemy is at (8,2). So two rows down. If the enemy moves up, they might come towards me. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since it's their first move, maybe they will go towards an apple as well. The apples at (0,2) is near their position. So maybe the enemy will go towards (0,2), which is down and left from (8,2). So they might move LEFT to (7,2) or DOWN to (8,1). So perhaps they are not a threat to me if I go to (8,4).\n\nBut maybe it's safer to take the UP path first to avoid any possible collision with the enemy. So UP to (9,5), then LEFT. That way, I'm moving away from the enemy's current position.\n\nSo the decision is between UP and LEFT. Both seem viable, but UP might be safer to start with. Let me check the board again. The apple at (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. So if I go UP to (9,5), then moving left to (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5). That's four moves. Each step is safe. The enemy is at (8,2), so not in that path. So that's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT to (8,4), then next move could be UP to (8,5), then left. Same steps. But maybe the enemy is moving towards (8,3) or something. Not sure. But since the enemy's body is empty, they can only move in one direction. So perhaps they are not a threat yet.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,4) is at (1,4). So if I go LEFT from (9,4), moving towards (8,4), (7,4), etc., I could eventually reach (1,4). But that's 8 steps left. That's a long way. But maybe there are other apples along the way. But the apple at (5,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go UP to (9,5) to start heading towards the apple at (5,5). That seems like the most efficient path to collect an apple quickly. Then, after collecting that apple, I can plan the next move towards another apple.\n\nWait, but when I move onto an apple, I grow. So after moving to (5,5), I would grow by one. So the body would extend. But since I'm just starting, my body is only the head. So after collecting the apple, my body would be two segments. But as long as I don't run into myself, which is not possible here since I'm moving forward.\n\nSo the plan is to go UP first. Let me confirm the coordinates. Current position is (9,4). UP increases Y by 1, so (9,5). That's valid. Then next move LEFT to (8,5), then (7,5), etc. All safe. So the first move should be UP.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (5,5), moving UP positions me to approach it efficiently. This path avoids the enemy snake and walls. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue LEFT towards (5,5) to gain a point. \n\nDirection: UP"

The board hasn't been updated yet, but since I moved UP to (9,5), I need to plan my next move.\n\nPossible directions from (9,5) are UP (to y=6), DOWN (back to y=4), LEFT (x=8, y=5), or RIGHT (invalid, since x=10 is out of bounds). So options are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (5,5). From (9,5), moving LEFT each step reduces the x-coordinate by 1. So moving LEFT four times would take me to (5,5). The first step would be LEFT to (8,5). Let's check for obstacles. The enemy is at (8,3), which is two rows below (8,5), so no immediate collision.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,4). The apples are at (1,6), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4), (5,5). The enemy snake is at (8,2) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head. The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). My last move was none, so this is the starting position.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible directions. From (9,4), possible moves are UP to (9,5), DOWN to (9,3), LEFT to (8,4), or RIGHT which would be (10,4) but that's out of bounds. So RIGHT is invalid. So options are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLooking at apples: The closest ones are (5,5) which is a bit far. The others are on the left side. (1,6) is up and left, (0,2) is down and left. (1,3) and (1,4) are also left but lower. Since I'm at (9,4), moving left towards column 8,7, etc. might get me closer to those apples. But need to check the path.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,4), that's safe. Then from there, maybe continue left towards the apples. But the enemy snake is at (8,2). So if I go left, I can start moving towards the middle where the apples are. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. But maybe the apples on the left are easier to reach first.\n\nWait, the apples at (1,3) and (1,4) are in column 1, rows 3 and 4. So if I go left, I can start moving towards column 8,7,6... but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is closer. Let's calculate the distance. From (9,4) to (5,5): that's 4 steps left and 1 up. So if I go left a few times and then up. But the enemy snake is at (8,2), which is two rows down from (8,2). So if I go left to (8,4), then next move could be left again to (7,4), then (6,4), etc. But maybe the apple at (5,5) is better. Alternatively, maybe the apple at (1,6) is up and left. But that's even further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going UP to (9,5) would get me closer to (5,5). From (9,5), then left towards (5,5). But that's a path. But moving up first might be a good idea. Let's see: from (9,4), UP to (9,5). Then next move could be LEFT to (8,5), then (7,5), etc. until reaching (5,5). That's 4 moves left. But the apple at (5,5) is in the same row as (9,5) if I go up once. Wait, (5,5) is at y=5. So if I go up to (9,5), then moving left towards (5,5) would take 4 steps. But each step left would get me closer. Alternatively, if I go LEFT first, then up. Let's see: from (9,4), LEFT to (8,4), then UP to (8,5), then left to (7,5), etc. That's also possible. But which path is safer?\n\nAlso, need to avoid the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,2). So if I go left to (8,4), that's two rows above the enemy. So that's safe. Then moving left again to (7,4), etc. But maybe the enemy is moving towards me? Not sure. Since the enemy's body is empty, maybe it's just starting out. So perhaps it's not a threat yet.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (9,3). Then maybe towards the apple at (1,3) or (1,4). But (1,3) is at y=3, so from (9,3), moving left. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's think about possible risks. If I go UP to (9,5), then next move could be LEFT. But is there any apple in that path? The apple at (5,5) is in that row. So moving left from (9,5) towards (5,5) would collect that apple. But that's 4 steps left. Each step left would take me closer. But each step left would also be safe as long as I don't hit any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (8,2), which is not in that path. So that seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT to (8,4), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,4), then (6,4), etc. But the apples in the left columns (1,3), (1,4) are in y=3 and 4. So if I go left to (8,4), then down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), etc., but that's a longer path. Maybe not as efficient.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go UP first to (9,5), then start moving left towards (5,5). That way, I can collect the apple at (5,5) in 4 moves. Also, moving up first would avoid the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (8,2), which is far from (9,5). So that's safer.\n\nBut wait, what's the risk of going UP? If I go UP to (9,5), is there any immediate danger? The board shows that at (9,4) is my head. The next cell up is (9,5), which is empty. So that's safe. Then moving left from there. So that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT to (8,4), that's also safe. Then from there, I can go up to (8,5) and then left towards (5,5). But that's the same number of steps as going up first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So if I can reach it, that's a point. But there are other apples as well. Maybe the apple at (1,6) is another target. But that's even further. So perhaps the apple at (5,5) is the closest one.\n\nSo the plan is to go UP to (9,5), then LEFT towards (5,5). That would collect the apple at (5,5) after moving left four times. Each step left would be safe as long as there's no enemy in the way. The enemy is at (8,2), which is not in that path. So that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT first, then UP, but that might take the same number of steps. Let's see: from (9,4) to (8,4) (LEFT), then UP to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), etc. That's also 4 steps left from (8,5) to (5,5). So same number of steps. But maybe going UP first is better because it's a straight path.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,2). If I go LEFT to (8,4), then the enemy is at (8,2). So two rows down. If the enemy moves up, they might come towards me. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since it's their first move, maybe they will go towards an apple as well. The apples at (0,2) is near their position. So maybe the enemy will go towards (0,2), which is down and left from (8,2). So they might move LEFT to (7,2) or DOWN to (8,1). So perhaps they are not a threat to me if I go to (8,4).\n\nBut maybe it's safer to take the UP path first to avoid any possible collision with the enemy. So UP to (9,5), then LEFT. That way, I'm moving away from the enemy's current position.\n\nSo the decision is between UP and LEFT. Both seem viable, but UP might be safer to start with. Let me check the board again. The apple at (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. So if I go UP to (9,5), then moving left to (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5). That's four moves. Each step is safe. The enemy is at (8,2), so not in that path. So that's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT to (8,4), then next move could be UP to (8,5), then left. Same steps. But maybe the enemy is moving towards (8,3) or something. Not sure. But since the enemy's body is empty, they can only move in one direction. So perhaps they are not a threat yet.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,4) is at (1,4). So if I go LEFT from (9,4), moving towards (8,4), (7,4), etc., I could eventually reach (1,4). But that's 8 steps left. That's a long way. But maybe there are other apples along the way. But the apple at (5,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go UP to (9,5) to start heading towards the apple at (5,5). That seems like the most efficient path to collect an apple quickly. Then, after collecting that apple, I can plan the next move towards another apple.\n\nWait, but when I move onto an apple, I grow. So after moving to (5,5), I would grow by one. So the body would extend. But since I'm just starting, my body is only the head. So after collecting the apple, my body would be two segments. But as long as I don't run into myself, which is not possible here since I'm moving forward.\n\nSo the plan is to go UP first. Let me confirm the coordinates. Current position is (9,4). UP increases Y by 1, so (9,5). That's valid. Then next move LEFT to (8,5), then (7,5), etc. All safe. So the first move should be UP.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (5,5), moving UP positions me to approach it efficiently. This path avoids the enemy snake and walls. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue LEFT towards (5,5) to gain a point. \n\nDirection: UP"

The apples are still at (1,6), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4), (5,5). The enemy snake #2 is at (8,3) with an empty body. The board hasn't been updated yet, but since I moved UP to (9,5), I need to plan my next move.\n\nPossible directions from (9,5) are UP (to y=6), DOWN (back to y=4), LEFT (x=8, y=5), or RIGHT (invalid, since x=10 is out of bounds). So options are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (5,5). From (9,5), moving LEFT each step reduces the x-coordinate by 1. So moving LEFT four times would take me to (5,5). The first step would be LEFT to (8,5). Let's check for obstacles. The enemy is at (8,3), which is two rows below (8,5), so no immediate collision. The path from (9,5) to (8,5) is clear. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,6) might get me closer to the apple at (1,6), but that's much farther. The apple at (5,5) is closer and more efficient. Moving DOWN would take me back to (9,4), which doesn't help progress towards any apple. \n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT towards (8,5), continuing the path to (5,5). This avoids the enemy and walls, and efficiently targets the nearest apple. Next turn, I'll continue LEFT until reaching the apple.\n</think>\n\nStrategy next turn: Continue LEFT towards (5,5) to collect the apple.  \nDirection: LEFT"

The enemy snake #2 is at (8,4) now. Wait, in the previous move, the enemy was at (8,3), but according to the updated board state, snake #2 is at (8,4) with body at []. So maybe they moved up?\n\nWait, the board state shows snake #2 at (8,4). So their head is there. My snake is at (8,5). So if I move LEFT again, I would go to (7,5). But wait, the apple at (5,5) is still four steps away. Let me check possible directions from (8,5). Possible moves are UP (to y=6), DOWN (to y=4), LEFT (x=7), or RIGHT (x=9). But moving RIGHT would take me back to (9,5), which I just left. Not helpful. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,4). So if I move DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4), that's where the enemy's head is. That would be a collision, so I can't go DOWN. So DOWN is dangerous. \n\nSo options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. But RIGHT is back to where I was. Not useful. So UP or LEFT. \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,5), that's moving towards the apple at (5,5). That's good. But need to check if there's any obstacle. The enemy is at (8,4), so (7,5) is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,6). Then I could head towards the apple at (1,6), but that's a longer path. The apple at (5,5) is closer. \n\nSo the best move is LEFT to (7,5) to continue towards the apple. Also, need to make sure that the path is clear. The next move after that would be LEFT again to (6,5), then (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (8,4). If I move LEFT, I'm moving away from them. So that's safe. \n\nSo direction should be LEFT again. The strategy is to keep moving left towards (5,5). \n\nWait, but the enemy's position is at (8,4). So their head is there. If I move LEFT to (7,5), that's safe. No collision. \n\nYes, so the next move is LEFT. That's the safest and most efficient path to the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDirection: LEFT"
