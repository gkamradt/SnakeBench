Moving towards this apple will be the most efficient way to gain points. The path to this apple involves moving left and then down.\n\n### Next Move:\nSince the closest apple is at (2, 3), the next step is to move left to (0, 3) and then down to (0, 3). However, moving left from (1, 3) will take us to (0, 3), which is not the optimal path. Instead, we should move down to (1, 2) and then left to (0, 2).\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**\n\nLEFT"
