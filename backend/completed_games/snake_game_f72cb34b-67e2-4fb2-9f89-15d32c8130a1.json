Moving up would take me closer to it, which could be risky.\n3. **Potential Moves**:\n   - **UP**: To (9, 3). Safe, but not toward any apples.\n   - **DOWN**: To (9, 1). Safe, but not toward any apples.\n   - **LEFT**: To (8, 2). Safe, heading toward the apple at (7, 7).\n   - **RIGHT**: Not possible, as I\u2019m already at the right edge of the board (x=9).\n\n### Strategy:\n- I want to move toward the closest apple to grow and gain points.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 2) seems like the best option, as it takes me closer to the apple at (7, 7) and avoids the enemy snake.\n\n### Next Move:\n**LEFT**"

I need to move towards an apple to gain points. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the available apples. There are apples at (7, 8), (5, 7), (3, 0), (0, 5), and (7, 7). I'll prioritize the closest ones. The closest apple to me is at (7, 7), but I need to be careful because there's another snake (#1) at (9, 2) with no body, which means it's not a threat yet, but I should keep an eye on it.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the apple at (7, 7) while keeping an eye on the other snakes, especially #1.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible moves.
