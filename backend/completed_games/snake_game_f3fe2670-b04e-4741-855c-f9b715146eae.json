I also see that there's an enemy snake at (1, 9) with a body at [].\n\nMy initial thought is to move towards the apple at (9, 9) since it's relatively close to my current position. However, I also need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nAfter considering my options, I think I'll move... RIGHT. This will bring me closer to the apple at (9, 9) and give me more options for my next move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll continue to move towards the apple at (9, 9) and try to avoid the enemy snake and the wall. If I can get to the apple, I'll try to eat it and grow my snake.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

However, moving down would put the snake into a position where it could potentially run into the wall or an apple, which is not ideal. Moving left would put the snake into a position where it could run into the wall. Moving right would put the snake into a position where it could run into the wall or an apple. Therefore, the safest and most strategic move is to move up, which will allow the snake to potentially eat an apple and grow.\n\n**Strategy**: Move up to (1, 8) and check if there is an apple there. If not, continue to move up to (1, 7) and so on, until an apple is found or the snake runs into a wall.\n\nDecided next move: UP\n\nEnd of thought process."
