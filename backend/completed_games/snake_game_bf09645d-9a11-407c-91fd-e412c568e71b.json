I must remain mindful of this as I plan my next move.\n\n### Analyzing Potential Moves\n\n1. **Up to (5, 5):**\n   - This position is currently empty, but it does not lead immediately to an apple.\n   \n2. **Down to (5, 3):**\n   - This position is occupied by my body, making this an invalid move.\n   \n3. **Left to (4, 4):**\n   - This position is empty and safe, providing another option.\n   \n4. **Right to (6, 4):**\n   - This position is also empty and safe, giving me yet another potential move.\n\n### Apple Locations \n- **(4, 0)**: Moving down and left multiple spaces.\n- **(2, 5)**: Far left and slightly up, difficult to reach currently.\n- **(4, 7)**: Requires moving up and left a few spaces.\n- **(0, 6)**: Too far away to pursue immediately.\n- **(9, 1)**: Also far off, less relevant in the near term.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward\nGiven my current open options of (5, 5), (4, 4), and (6, 4):\n- Moving **UP to (5, 5)** maintains my current position but does not get me nearer to an apple actively. \n- Moving **LEFT to (4, 4)** might be beneficial as it puts me on a path to explore toward other left-side apples later on.\n- Moving **RIGHT to (6, 4)** keeps me in the lane with more flexibility. However, it neither leads toward any apples and may leave me with less spatial control along my body.\n\nConsidering that my goal is to still move towards possible apple locations while ensuring that I have maneuverability for later turns, I will choose to move **LEFT to (4, 4)**. This positioning will allow me to scout for potential moves towards the locations of apples either in my next turn or those beyond and offers more adjacencies to navigate in the subsequent rounds.\n\n### Decision\nMoving to (4, 4) is strategic as it opens options for subsequent turns without compromising safety or immediate apple access.\n\nMy decided next move is: **LEFT**."

This is less strategic as it\u2019s likely to put you farther from potential apples.\n\n3. **Left to (4, 1):**\n   - This space is also empty; however, this continues to push your snake away from the bottom of the board while not approaching any apples at the moment.\n\n4. **Right to (6, 1):**\n   - This puts you back to your body position which would not be a valid move and would cause you to lose the game.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- The best strategic move from (5, 1) is to go **UP to (5, 2)**, allowing you to progress while keeping your snake safe and preparing for future apples.\n\n### Next Moves Consideration:\nMoving up takes you away from immediate danger (your body) and keeps you on the apple path in future moves. Post this move, reevaluating apple locations and potential moves will be necessary.\n\n### Decision:\nThe decided next move is: UP"

It keeps me flexible for exploration to the apples while minimizing risk, as my body does not block this option. \n\nGoing up also provides a chance to potentially maneuver away from the enemy snake if needed, as they are slightly below me.\n\n### Decision\nTaking all this into consideration, I will move **UP** to (4, 5).\n\nMy decided next move is: **UP**."

It allows me to potentially grow in future moves. It keeps me flexible for exploration to the apples while minimizing risk, as my body does not block this option. \n\nGoing up also provides a chance to potentially maneuver away from the enemy snake if needed, as they are slightly below me.\n\n### Decision\nTaking all this into consideration, I will move **UP** to (4, 5).\n\nMy decided next move is: **UP**."

I have already established that there are no immediate threats from the enemy snake located at (3, 3), which is two spaces away horizontally and one space down vertically. I must remain mindful of this as I plan my next move.\n\n### Analyzing Potential Moves\n\n1. **Up to (5, 5):**\n   - This position is currently empty, but it does not lead immediately to an apple.\n   \n2. **Down to (5, 3):**\n   - This position is occupied by my body, making this an invalid move.\n   \n3. **Left to (4, 4):**\n   - This position is empty and safe, providing another option.\n   \n4. **Right to (6, 4):**\n   - This position is also empty and safe, giving me yet another potential move.\n\n### Apple Locations \n- **(4, 0)**: Moving down and left multiple spaces.\n- **(2, 5)**: Far left and slightly up, difficult to reach currently.\n- **(4, 7)**: Requires moving up and left a few spaces.\n- **(0, 6)**: Too far away to pursue immediately.\n- **(9, 1)**: Also far off, less relevant in the near term.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward\nGiven my current open options of (5, 5), (4, 4), and (6, 4):\n- Moving **UP to (5, 5)** maintains my current position but does not get me nearer to an apple actively. \n- Moving **LEFT to (4, 4)** might be beneficial as it puts me on a path to explore toward other left-side apples later on.\n- Moving **RIGHT to (6, 4)** keeps me in the lane with more flexibility. However, it neither leads toward any apples and may leave me with less spatial control along my body.\n\nConsidering that my goal is to still move towards possible apple locations while ensuring that I have maneuverability for later turns, I will choose to move **LEFT to (4, 4)**. This positioning will allow me to scout for potential moves towards the locations of apples either in my next turn or those beyond and offers more adjacencies to navigate in the subsequent rounds.\n\n### Decision\nMoving to (4, 4) is strategic as it opens options for subsequent turns without compromising safety or immediate apple access.\n\nMy decided next move is: **LEFT**."

It allows me to potentially grow in future moves. It keeps me flexible for exploration to the apples while minimizing risk, as my body does not block this option. \n\nGoing up also provides a chance to potentially maneuver away from the enemy snake if needed, as they are slightly below me.\n\n### Decision\nTaking all this into consideration, I will move **UP** to (4, 5).\n\nMy decided next move is: **UP**."
