It, however, does not lead to an apple.\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 2))** - This move does not lead me to an apple but keeps me on the board. \n3. **LEFT (to (1, 3))** - This move would be safe and allows me to avoid running into Snake #2.\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 3))** - This move would lead me directly into Snake #2, which is not a good option.\n\n### Strategy Consideration\n- Ideally, I want to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple I could target would be at (4, 2) if I could move directly to the left (down to (2, 2) and then up to (4, 2)). But I would have to maneuver around.\n\nGiven that the only immediate move that creates a strategic advantage while staying safe is DOWN to (2, 2), which will then allow me to potentially move towards (4, 2) in the next turn without colliding with any snakes.\n\nThus, my next move is: **DOWN**."

It, however, does not lead to an apple.\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 2))** - This move does not lead me to an apple but keeps me on the board. \n3. **LEFT (to (1, 3))** - This move would be safe and allows me to avoid running into Snake #2.\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 3))** - This move would lead me directly into Snake #2, which is not a good option.\n\n### Strategy Consideration\n- Ideally, I want to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple I could target would be at (4, 2) if I could move directly to the left (down to (2, 2) and then up to (4, 2)). But I would have to maneuver around.\n\nGiven that the only immediate move that creates a strategic advantage while staying safe is DOWN to (2, 2), which will then allow me to potentially move towards (4, 2) in the next turn without colliding with any snakes.\n\nThus, my next move is: **DOWN**."

Moving directly to (1, 2) or (3, 2) allows for different paths to this target apple in the following turns.\n- Moving UP returns me to (2, 3), while moving DOWN takes me to (2, 1), which does not help.\n- LEFT and RIGHT both remain viable options for strategic positioning toward the apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 2), I set myself up to potentially move UP to (1, 3) or to another option depending on the enemy snake's movement and apple positions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTaking into account all these considerations, I will move LEFT to (1, 2) for this turn. This position sets me up for either moving up towards (1, 3) for better positionings or moving towards (2, 2) as necessary.\n\nNext Move: **LEFT**."
