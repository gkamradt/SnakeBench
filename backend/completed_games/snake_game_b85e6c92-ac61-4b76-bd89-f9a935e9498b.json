From (3, 8), there are no immediate obstacles directly to my right until column 6, where I plan to start moving downward.\n- **Enemy Snakes:** Snake #2 is positioned further away toward the north (at (7, 9) and (8, 9)), so there's no immediate threat from this snake for moving right towards my target.\n\n### Immediate Move Decision:\n- **Move RIGHT** to (4, 8). This continues my horizontal movement towards column 6. The path remains clear, and this move keeps my snake in a good position to make efficient subsequent downward moves towards (6, 5).\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves:\n- Continue evaluating the path as I approach column 6. \n- Once at (6, 8), I'll consider moving downwards to (6, 5) to get the apple while assessing any changes in the positions of Snake #2 or sudden obstacles.\n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most effective move with the current board state is to:\n\nDecided next move: **RIGHT**."
