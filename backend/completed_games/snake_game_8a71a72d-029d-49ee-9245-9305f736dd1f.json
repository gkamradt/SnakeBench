It is strategically advantageous to continue moving UP to immediately collect another apple.\n- Considering the enemy snake's position, continuing upwards does not bring me any closer to the enemy, ensuring safety and minimal risk of confrontation at this time.\n\n**Future Strategy and Considerations:**\n- After collecting the apple at (5, 7), planning future moves will be essential. I may need to adjust direction based on the new locations of apples or the movement of the enemy snake.\n- Keeping track of the movement of the enemy snake (Snake #2) to anticipate its path will be crucial to avoid accidental confrontations or getting trapped.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**\n\nThis move will allow me to collect the adjacent apple at (5, 7) and continue expanding on the board safely."

It\u2019s slightly risky due to the proximity to the board edges but feasible.\n- **Moving to the Apple at (7, 8) or (9, 7):** These require navigation towards the upper right, which could potentially put me closer to the enemy snake.

Moving RIGHT this turn sets me towards x-coordinate 6, from where I can then decide the optimal further steps downward in subsequent turns.\n- This maneuver not only positions me well for the next apple but also keeps my path flexible to adjust based on enemy movement or to redirect towards the upper right apples.\n\n**Observations for Future Strategy:**\n- Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movement and plan routes that maximize apple collection while minimizing risk of collision or entrapment against walls or the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT\nThis move aligns with a strategic, point-accumulating, and conservative growth approach, with a focus on extending towards the closest feasible apple."
