My goal is to collect as many apples as possible and avoid running into other snakes or the walls.\n\nSince I'm at the top right corner, I have limited options for movement. I can move down to (2, 8) or left to (1, 9). However, moving down might put me in a position where I'm more likely to run into Snake #1, which is at (2, 7).\n\nMy next move will be: DOWN.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to move down to (2, 8) and see if I can find an apple or a safe path to continue growing. If I encounter Snake #1, I'll need to think quickly and come up with a plan to avoid it."
