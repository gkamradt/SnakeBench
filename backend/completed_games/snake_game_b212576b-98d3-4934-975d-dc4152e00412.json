This would create more distance between myself and the enemy snake, potentially giving me a safer path to that apple. Additionally, there are other apples located at (9, 1), (4, 8), and (6, 2) that I could potentially target after consuming the apple at (8, 3).\n\nGiven the current situation, I believe the best strategy is to prioritize my own safety and survival over immediately consuming the closest apple. By moving RIGHT to (5, 5), I can create some distance from the enemy snake and have more options to maneuver and locate additional apples without risking a collision.\n\nMy next move is: RIGHT.\n\nFor my next turn, I'll continue to focus on carefully navigating the board, keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake, and efficiently locating and consuming as many apples as possible to maximize my score."
