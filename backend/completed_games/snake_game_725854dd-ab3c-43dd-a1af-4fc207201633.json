I also notice that there's another apple at (4, 2) which is a bit far from me. The enemy snake is at position (2, 4) and doesn't seem to be a threat for now.\n\nConsidering the positions of the apples and the enemy snake, I think my best move is to go up and try to get the apple at (5, 7). This will give me a point and also allow me to plan my next move.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake, as it could become a threat in the future. But for now, it seems to be far away from me.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the enemy snake and try to position myself to get the apple at (8, 8) or (8, 7). Also, be careful not to run into the wall.\n\nNext move: UP"
