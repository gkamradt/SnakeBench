I should avoid moving towards the right side of the board to prevent any potential collisions.\n\nConsidering my options, I think it would be best to move upwards first, then turn right towards the apple at (0, 4). This way, I can avoid Snake #2 and collect an apple in one move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move upwards, then turn right towards the apple at (0, 4).\n\nNext move: UP."
