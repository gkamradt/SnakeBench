The nearest apple in terms of Manhattan distance seems to be at coordinate (3, 7). \n   - Current position: (5, 9)\n   - Distance: |5 - 3| + |9 - 7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2.

There's no risk of hitting a wall or another snake directly, allowing me to focus on optimizing my path to the target apple.\n\n**Strategic approach for next moves:**\n1. Move towards (3, 7) while avoiding going too close to enemy snakes or confinements.\n2.

On the board, there are multiple apples distributed as follows:\n\n- (3, 7)\n- (0, 7)\n- (2, 5)\n- (5, 1)\n- (6, 1)\n\nI'm aiming to grow and gain points, so I should target the nearest apple while avoiding obstacles like the walls and the enemy snake currently at (8, 6).\n\n**Analyzing nearest apples:**\n\n1. The nearest apple in terms of Manhattan distance seems to be at coordinate (3, 7). \n   - Current position: (5, 9)\n   - Distance: |5 - 3| + |9 - 7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. Distance to (2, 5) is:\n   - Distance: |5 - 2| + |9 - 5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. Distance to (0, 7) is:\n   - Distance: |5 - 0| + |9 - 7| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4. Distances to apples in the lower region are more significant:\n   - (5, 1): |5 - 5| + |9 - 1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n   - (6, 1): |5 - 6| + |9 - 1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nThus, the nearest apple is at (3, 7), which means I can proceed by moving in the direction that reduces the distance towards it. However, I am currently at (5, 9), so the first move should be DOWN to move closer.\n\nConsidering the lack of immediate threats nearby, my move should be cautious yet aggressive towards reaching an apple. There's no risk of hitting a wall or another snake directly, allowing me to focus on optimizing my path to the target apple.\n\n**Strategic approach for next moves:**\n1. Move towards (3, 7) while avoiding going too close to enemy snakes or confinements.\n2. Monitor enemy snake positions in upcoming turns to make adjustments if necessary.\n\n**Next move decision:**\nTo start moving toward the nearest apple at (3, 7), I will move DOWN.\n\n**Decided move: DOWN.**"

The nearest apple in terms of Manhattan distance seems to be at coordinate (3, 7). \n   - Current position: (5, 9)\n   - Distance: |5 - 3| + |9 - 7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. Distance to (2, 5) is:\n   - Distance: |5 - 2| + |9 - 5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. Distance to (0, 7) is:\n   - Distance: |5 - 0| + |9 - 7| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4. Distances to apples in the lower region are more significant:\n   - (5, 1): |5 - 5| + |9 - 1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n   - (6, 1): |5 - 6| + |9 - 1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nThus, the nearest apple is at (3, 7), which means I can proceed by moving in the direction that reduces the distance towards it. However, I am currently at (5, 9), so the first move should be DOWN to move closer.\n\nConsidering the lack of immediate threats nearby, my move should be cautious yet aggressive towards reaching an apple. There's no risk of hitting a wall or another snake directly, allowing me to focus on optimizing my path to the target apple.\n\n**Strategic approach for next moves:**\n1. Move towards (3, 7) while avoiding going too close to enemy snakes or confinements.\n2. Monitor enemy snake positions in upcoming turns to make adjustments if necessary.\n\n**Next move decision:**\nTo start moving toward the nearest apple at (3, 7), I will move DOWN.\n\n**Decided move: DOWN.**"

The nearest apple in terms of Manhattan distance seems to be at coordinate (3, 7). \n   - Current position: (5, 9)\n   - Distance: |5 - 3| + |9 - 7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. Distance to (2, 5) is:\n   - Distance: |5 - 2| + |9 - 5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3. Distance to (0, 7) is:\n   - Distance: |5 - 0| + |9 - 7| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n4.

However, I am currently at (5, 9), so the first move should be DOWN to move closer.\n\nConsidering the lack of immediate threats nearby, my move should be cautious yet aggressive towards reaching an apple. There's no risk of hitting a wall or another snake directly, allowing me to focus on optimizing my path to the target apple.\n\n**Strategic approach for next moves:**\n1. Move towards (3, 7) while avoiding going too close to enemy snakes or confinements.\n2. Monitor enemy snake positions in upcoming turns to make adjustments if necessary.\n\n**Next move decision:**\nTo start moving toward the nearest apple at (3, 7), I will move DOWN.\n\n**Decided move: DOWN.**"

I have successfully consumed the apple located there, gaining a point.\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n\n- Remaining apples are located at: (0, 7), (5, 1), (6, 1), (8, 8), and (0, 4).\n\n**Situation with the Enemy Snake:**\n\n- Snake #2 remains at (5, 4), currently not a threat to my path.\n\n**Potential Moves and Strategies:**\n\n1. **Move LEFT:**\n   - Moving further left to (1, 5) could position me closer to the apples at (0, 7) and (0, 4), but it moves me away from the cluster of apples on the right side.\n\n2. **Move DOWN:**\n   - Moving down to (2, 4) doesn\u2019t provide a strategic advantage, as no apples are nearby in that direction, but it positions me closer to the enemy which could be risky.\n\n3. **Move UP:**\n   - Moving up to (2, 6) will bring me one step closer to the apple at (0, 7), an apple I could target in a future move.\n\n4. **Move RIGHT:**\n   - Moving right to (3, 5) would start moving me towards the apples at (5, 1) and (6, 1). Given that these are in a cluster, focusing on these apples could be profitable. It also keeps me a safe distance from Snake #2.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n\n- The apples at (5, 1) and (6, 1) are close together, signifying an efficient path if I decide to head towards them. I must stay aware of Snake #2\u2019s movements, which is close to these apples.\n\n- Evaluating the enemy's possible goals and adapting my strategy towards available apples without confrontation is crucial.\n\n**Decided Move:** RIGHT\n\nNext turn, I should reassess the board and determine whether to pursue the apples at (5, 1) and (6, 1) or head for another target depending on Snake #2's moves."
