To do that, I need to move left now.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into Snake #1 again. Since it's at position (2, 0) with its body at [(1, 0)], I should be safe moving left for now.\n\nNext turn, I'll think about moving up again to get closer to the apple at (2, 8). I'll also keep an eye on Snake #1's movement to make sure I don't get caught.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
