(0, 5) - up and left\n3. (8, 7) - up and right\n4. (9, 4) - right and up\n5. (9, 3) - right and up\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (6, 4) heading north, not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy:\n- I want to continue pursuing the (1, 1) apple as it's still the closest\n- I can't move DOWN (will hit wall) or RIGHT (will hit my tail)\n- Moving LEFT is safe and continues my path to the apple\n- Moving UP is also safe but takes me away from my current target\n\nPlan:\n- Continue moving LEFT to reach (1, 1)\n- After getting that apple, evaluate whether to go for (0, 5) or one of the upper right apples\n- Keep monitoring enemy snake's movement as it could affect my future paths\n\nI choose LEFT to continue my approach to the (1, 1) apple. This is the most direct path to my current target and keeps me away from the enemy snake.\n\nDirection: LEFT"
