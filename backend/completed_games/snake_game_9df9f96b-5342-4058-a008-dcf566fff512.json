It maintains a manageable distance and does not inhibit our immediate path to the nearby apples.\n- Pathway Analysis:\n  - Moving RIGHT from (7, 1) to (9, 1) is a straight and secure path to grab the apple there without current threats observed.\n  - Moving DOWN after collecting or toward (8, 0) needs careful thinking as it could pose boundary risks.\n  - Extensive horizontal movements shouldn't be problematic as there's no threat from the enemy snake in these pathways.\n\n**Strategic Planning:**\n- Primary Target: (9, 1) apple which is directly in line and can be reached safely within two moves.\n- Future Plays: Upon reaching (9, 1), consider the best approach to either collect the apple at (8, 0) or start planning the path upwards towards the higher-y apples, given that we need to maximize points and apple consumption.\n- Keep watch on the enemy's movements, especially if they start moving northward as it might adjust our route strategies especially when considering movement towards higher Y coordinates.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT (to move from (7, 1) to (8, 1), setting up a subsequent move to grab the apple at (9, 1))."

The closest apple is still at (8, 0).\n3. The next closest apples are at (9, 9) and (1, 9), both 7 moves away.\n4. The apple at (9, 6) is 8 moves away.\n5. The enemy snake at (7, 2) with body at [(6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1)] is now 5 moves away from me and could potentially block my path if I don't move quickly.\n6. Moving towards the apple at (8, 0) is still the best option to gain points quickly, but I need to be mindful of the enemy snake's position.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: I should continue moving RIGHT towards the apple at (8, 0) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement. If the enemy snake starts blocking my path, I may need to adjust my strategy and go for a different apple.\n\nMy next move: RIGHT"
