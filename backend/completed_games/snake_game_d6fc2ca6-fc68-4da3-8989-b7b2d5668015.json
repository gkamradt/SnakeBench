Moving down would be the best choice for this turn, as it will put some distance between me and the enemy snake, and set me up to go for the apple at (8, 2) on the next turn.\n\nFor the next turn, I'll want to move up and to the right to get closer to the apple at (8, 2). This will also help me avoid the enemy snake.\n\nMy next move is: DOWN."
