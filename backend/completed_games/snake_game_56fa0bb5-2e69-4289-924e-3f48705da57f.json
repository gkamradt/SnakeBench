            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,9). There are apples at (4,1), (8,7), (8,5), (1,9), and (2,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. I'm at (3,9), which is near the top. There's an apple at (1,9) to my left and another at (2,1) way below and to the left. There are also apples at (4,1), (8,7), and (8,5).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (5,1), which is below and to the right of my current position.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- I'm at (3,9)\n\n- Apple at (1,9): that's two steps to the left.\n\n- Apple at (2,1): that's down 8 steps and right 1 step.\n\n- Apple at (4,1): down 8 steps and right 1 step.\n\n- Apple at (8,7): down 2 steps and right 5 steps.\n\n- Apple at (8,5): down 4 steps and right 5 steps.\n\nHmm. The apple at (1,9) is the closest, only two steps to the left. But I need to see if there are any obstacles there. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . A . 2 . . . . . .\n\nSo, at (0,9) is empty, (1,9) is an apple, (2,9) is empty, (3,9) is me (2), etc.\n\nSo, I can move left to (2,9), then left again to (1,9) to eat the apple. Seems straightforward. But I need to think about the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,1), and I'm at (3,9). It's quite far away. Maybe I can focus on eating the closest apple first.\n\nBut wait, after eating the apple at (1,9), I'll grow in length. So, I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without running into myself or the enemy.\n\nLet me think about the board again. If I move left to (2,9), then left to (1,9), I'll eat the apple and grow. So, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I might want to go for another apple. Looking at the board, the next closest apple might be at (2,1), but that's way down at row 1.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (4,1), which is also at row 1.\n\nWait, there's also apples at (8,7) and (8,5), which are closer in the X direction but further down in Y.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1). It's down 8 steps and right 1 step.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (8,7). That's down 2 steps and right 5 steps.\n\nLet me see the board again:\n\nRow 9: . A . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A . A 1 . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, from (3,9), if I go down to row 7, which is two steps down, to (3,7), then go right 5 steps to (8,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to see if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at row 7: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, at (7,7) is the apple.\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nSo, from (3,9), down 2 to (3,7), then right 5 to (8,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at row 7: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, columns 0 to 7 are empty, and column 8 has the apple.\n\nSo, from (3,7), I can move right to (4,7), then (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7).\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut that's a longer path compared to going left to (1,9).\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating the apple at (1,9), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nI need to make sure that in the process of moving to (1,9), I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this small move, it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can plan a path to multiple apples.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the Manhattan distance to each apple and prioritize the closest one.\n\nManhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in the X and Y coordinates.\n\nSo, to (1,9): |3-1| + |9-9| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nTo (2,1): |3-2| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nTo (4,1): |3-4| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nTo (8,7): |3-8| + |9-7| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nTo (8,5): |3-8| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,9) with a distance of 2.\n\nNext closest is at (8,7) with distance 7.\n\nThen, the rest are at distance 9.\n\nSo, logically, I should go for (1,9) first.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (1,9), I'll grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, my new tail will be at (3,9), assuming I moved left to (2,9), then left again to (1,9).\n\nSo, now, I'm at (1,9), and my tail is at (2,9), which was my previous position.\n\nNow, I need to choose the next apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, the next closest apple would be at (2,1), but that's still pretty far away.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going down to row 7 to get the apple at (8,7), but that's also a long way.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,1), and I'm at (1,9).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nBut it's in row 1, column 5, and I'm in row 9, column 1.\n\nSo, quite separated.\n\nI need to think about the possible paths and see if our paths might cross.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (1,9), then maybe consider moving down towards row 7 to get (8,7), then maybe over to row 5 for (8,5), and so on.\n\nBut I need to plan this carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (8,7), then (8,5), then (4,1), and finally (2,1).\n\nBut that seems like a lot of movement.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the order that minimizes the total distance traveled.\n\nLet me list out the apples and their positions:\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (8,7)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,9)\n\n- (2,1)\n\nI'm currently at (3,9).\n\nAfter eating (1,9), I'll be at (1,9).\n\nFrom there, maybe I can go down to row 7 to get (8,7), then to (8,5), then over to (4,1), and finally to (2,1).\n\nBut that seems inefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, where I always go for the closest apple available.\n\nSo, starting at (3,9), closest is (1,9), then from there, maybe (2,1), then (4,1), then (8,5), then (8,7).\n\nWait, but (2,1"

So, first things first, I need to understand where I am and what's around me.\n\nI'm currently at position (3,8), which is on a 10x10 grid where (0,0) is the bottom left and (9,9) is the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are towards the top of the grid.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at positions (8,7), (8,5), (1,9), (2,1), and (9,3). There's also an enemy snake at (4,1) with its body at (5,1).\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and from the board state, it seems I'm at (3,8), and there's an apple at (1,9), which is to my left.\n\nFirst, I need to think about which apple to go for. There are a few factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Path Clearance**: Ensuring there are no obstacles or enemy snakes in the way.\n\n3. **Future Moves**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (3,8):\n\n- (8,7): |3-8| + |8-7| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (8,5): |3-8| + |8-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (1,9): |3-1| + |8-9| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,1): |3-2| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (9,3): |3-9| + |8-3| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,9) with a distance of 3. That seems like a good starting point.\n\nNow, let's think about the path to (1,9). From (3,8), I can move left to (2,8), then up to (2,9), and finally left to (1,9). But looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . .

A . . 1 T . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nWait, in row 9, column 1 has an apple, so (1,9) is indeed an apple.\n\nFrom (3,8), moving left to (2,8), then left to (1,8), then up to (1,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut looking at row 8: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nSo, at (3,8), which is where I am, and moving left to (2,8), which is empty, then to (1,8), which is also empty, and then up to (1,9) for the apple.\n\nSeems straightforward. No obstacles in this path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,9), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move left to (2,8), then left to (1,8), and then up to (1,9), my tail will extend, so (2,8) will still be part of my body.\n\nThen, from (1,9), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,7)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (9,3)\n\nNow, from (1,9), the closest apple is probably (2,1), but that's still pretty far away.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to pick up (9,3), but that's also a considerable distance.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider picking up another apple that's closer after (1,9).\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nFrom (1,9), the apple at (2,1) is |1-2| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is |1-9| + |9-3| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is |1-8| + |9-7| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nThe apple at (8,5) is |1-8| + |9-5| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\nSo, the next closest is still (2,1) and (8,7), both with a distance of 9.\n\nThat seems pretty far. Maybe I should consider picking up (9,3) next, but that's even farther.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider moving down towards the cluster of apples at (8,7) and (8,5).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (1,9) to (8,7), which is a distance of 7 right and 2 down.\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, it's at (4,1) with its body at (5,1). So, it's likely moving horizontally or maybe vertically, but I don't have full information on its direction.\n\nI need to be cautious not to run into it.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to pick up the closest apples first and then assess.\n\nSo, for now, I'll go for (1,9), then maybe consider moving down towards (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nWait, (2,1) is another apple, and (4,1) might be a mistake because there's an enemy snake at (4,1).\n\nWait, in the board state, row 1 has an apple at (2,1), and the enemy snake is at (4,1).\n\nSo, I need to be careful around that area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move down towards (9,3), but that seems even farther.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the order in which I pick up the apples based on minimizing the total distance traveled.\n\nStarting at (3,8):\n\n1. Go to (1,9): distance 3\n\n2. From (1,9), go to (2,1): distance |1-2| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\n3. From (2,1), go to (4,1): distance |2-4| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n4. From (4,1), go to (8,5): |4-8| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n5. From (8,5), go to (8,7): |8-8| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nTotal distance: 3 + 9 + 2 + 8 + 2 = 24\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n1. (3,8) -> (8,7): |3-8| + |8-7| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n2. (8,7) -> (8,5): |8-8| + |7-5| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n3. (8,5) -> (4,1): |8-4| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n4. (4,1) -> (2,1): |4-2| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n5. (2,1) -> (1,9): |2-1| + |1-9| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nTotal distance: 6 + 2 + 8 + 2 + 9 = 27\n\nThat's higher than the previous order.\n\nAnother order:\n\n1. (3,8) -> (1,9): 3\n\n2. (1,9) -> (9,3): |1-9| + |9-3| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\n3. (9,3) -> (8,5): |9-8| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. (8,5) -> (8,7): 0 + 2 = 2\n\n5. (8,7) -> (4,1): |8-4| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTotal distance: 3 + 14 + 3 + 2 + 10 = 32\n\nThat's even higher.\n\nSo, the first order seems better:"

There are apples at (4,1), (8,7), (8,5), (1,9), and (2,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (5,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. I'm at (3,9), which is near the top. There's an apple at (1,9) to my left and another at (2,1) way below and to the left. There are also apples at (4,1), (8,7), and (8,5).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (5,1), which is below and to the right of my current position.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- I'm at (3,9)\n\n- Apple at (1,9): that's two steps to the left.\n\n- Apple at (2,1): that's down 8 steps and right 1 step.\n\n- Apple at (4,1): down 8 steps and right 1 step.\n\n- Apple at (8,7): down 2 steps and right 5 steps.\n\n- Apple at (8,5): down 4 steps and right 5 steps.\n\nHmm. The apple at (1,9) is the closest, only two steps to the left. But I need to see if there are any obstacles there. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . A . 2 . . . . . .\n\nSo, at (0,9) is empty, (1,9) is an apple, (2,9) is empty, (3,9) is me (2), etc.\n\nSo, I can move left to (2,9), then left again to (1,9) to eat the apple. Seems straightforward. But I need to think about the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,1), and I'm at (3,9). It's quite far away. Maybe I can focus on eating the closest apple first.\n\nBut wait, after eating the apple at (1,9), I'll grow in length. So, I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without running into myself or the enemy.\n\nLet me think about the board again. If I move left to (2,9), then left to (1,9), I'll eat the apple and grow. So, my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I might want to go for another apple. Looking at the board, the next closest apple might be at (2,1), but that's way down at row 1.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (4,1), which is also at row 1.\n\nWait, there's also apples at (8,7) and (8,5), which are closer in the X direction but further down in Y.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1). It's down 8 steps and right 1 step.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (8,7). That's down 2 steps and right 5 steps.\n\nLet me see the board again:\n\nRow 9: . A . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A . A 1 . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, from (3,9), if I go down to row 7, which is two steps down, to (3,7), then go right 5 steps to (8,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to see if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at row 7: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, at (7,7) is the apple.\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nSo, from (3,9), down 2 to (3,7), then right 5 to (8,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at row 7: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, columns 0 to 7 are empty, and column 8 has the apple.\n\nSo, from (3,7), I can move right to (4,7), then (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7).\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut that's a longer path compared to going left to (1,9).\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating the apple at (1,9), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nI need to make sure that in the process of moving to (1,9), I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this small move, it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can plan a path to multiple apples.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the Manhattan distance to each apple and prioritize the closest one.\n\nManhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in the X and Y coordinates.\n\nSo, to (1,9): |3-1| + |9-9| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nTo (2,1): |3-2| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nTo (4,1): |3-4| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nTo (8,7): |3-8| + |9-7| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nTo (8,5): |3-8| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,9) with a distance of 2.\n\nNext closest is at (8,7) with distance 7.\n\nThen, the rest are at distance 9.\n\nSo, logically, I should go for (1,9) first.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (1,9), I'll grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nSo, my new tail will be at (3,9), assuming I moved left to (2,9), then left again to (1,9).\n\nSo, now, I'm at (1,9), and my tail is at (2,9), which was my previous position.\n\nNow, I need to choose the next apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, the next closest apple would be at (2,1), but that's still pretty far away.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going down to row 7 to get the apple at (8,7), but that's also a long way.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,1), and I'm at (1,9).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nBut it's in row 1, column 5, and I'm in row 9, column 1.\n\nSo, quite separated.\n\nI need to think about the possible paths and see if our paths might cross.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (1,9), then maybe consider moving down towards row 7 to get (8,7), then maybe over to row 5 for (8,5), and so on.\n\nBut I need to plan this carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (8,7), then (8,5), then (4,1), and finally (2,1).\n\nBut that seems like a lot of movement.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the order that minimizes the total distance traveled.\n\nLet me list out the apples and their positions:\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (8,7)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,9)\n\n- (2,1)\n\nI'm currently at (3,9).\n\nAfter eating (1,9), I'll be at (1,9).\n\nFrom there, maybe I can go down to row 7 to get (8,7), then to (8,5), then over to (4,1), and finally to (2,1).\n\nBut that seems inefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, where I always go for the closest apple available.\n\nSo, starting at (3,9), closest is (1,9), then from there, maybe (2,1), then (4,1), then (8,5), then (8,7).\n\nWait, but (2,1"

Go to (1,9): distance 3\n\n2. From (1,9), go to (2,1): distance |1-2| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\n3. From (2,1), go to (4,1): distance |2-4| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n4. From (4,1), go to (8,5): |4-8| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n5. From (8,5), go to (8,7): |8-8| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nTotal distance: 3 + 9 + 2 + 8 + 2 = 24\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n1. (3,8) -> (8,7): |3-8| + |8-7| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n2. (8,7) -> (8,5): |8-8| + |7-5| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n3. (8,5) -> (4,1): |8-4| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n4. (4,1) -> (2,1): |4-2| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n5. (2,1) -> (1,9): |2-1| + |1-9| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nTotal distance: 6 + 2 + 8 + 2 + 9 = 27\n\nThat's higher than the previous order.\n\nAnother order:\n\n1. (3,8) -> (1,9): 3\n\n2. (1,9) -> (9,3): |1-9| + |9-3| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\n3. (9,3) -> (8,5): |9-8| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. (8,5) -> (8,7): 0 + 2 = 2\n\n5. (8,7) -> (4,1): |8-4| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTotal distance: 3 + 14 + 3 + 2 + 10 = 32\n\nThat's even higher.\n\nSo, the first order seems better:"

Since I'm already at the same y-coordinate as the apple at (1, 9), I can try to move up to get closer to it.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the possibility of moving left to get closer to the apple at (8, 7). If I move left, I'll be at position (2, 1) which is still a safe distance from the enemy snake. From there, I can try to move up again to get closer to the apple.\n\nBut moving up seems like a safer option for now, as it will put me in a position where I can potentially move up to the apple at (1, 9) in the next turn.\n\nNext move: UP."

So, first things first, I need to understand where I am and what's around me.\n\nI'm currently at position (3,8), which is on a 10x10 grid where (0,0) is the bottom left and (9,9) is the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are towards the top of the grid.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at positions (8,7), (8,5), (1,9), (2,1), and (9,3). There's also an enemy snake at (4,1) with its body at (5,1).\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and from the board state, it seems I'm at (3,8), and there's an apple at (1,9), which is to my left.\n\nFirst, I need to think about which apple to go for. There are a few factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Path Clearance**: Ensuring there are no obstacles or enemy snakes in the way.\n\n3. **Future Moves**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (3,8):\n\n- (8,7): |3-8| + |8-7| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (8,5): |3-8| + |8-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (1,9): |3-1| + |8-9| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (2,1): |3-2| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (9,3): |3-9| + |8-3| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,9) with a distance of 3. That seems like a good starting point.\n\nNow, let's think about the path to (1,9). From (3,8), I can move left to (2,8), then up to (2,9), and finally left to (1,9). But looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A . . 1 T . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nWait, in row 9, column 1 has an apple, so (1,9) is indeed an apple.\n\nFrom (3,8), moving left to (2,8), then left to (1,8), then up to (1,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut looking at row 8: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nSo, at (3,8), which is where I am, and moving left to (2,8), which is empty, then to (1,8), which is also empty, and then up to (1,9) for the apple.\n\nSeems straightforward. No obstacles in this path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,9), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move left to (2,8), then left to (1,8), and then up to (1,9), my tail will extend, so (2,8) will still be part of my body.\n\nThen, from (1,9), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,7)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (9,3)\n\nNow, from (1,9), the closest apple is probably (2,1), but that's still pretty far away.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to pick up (9,3), but that's also a considerable distance.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider picking up another apple that's closer after (1,9).\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nFrom (1,9), the apple at (2,1) is |1-2| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is |1-9| + |9-3| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is |1-8| + |9-7| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nThe apple at (8,5) is |1-8| + |9-5| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\nSo, the next closest is still (2,1) and (8,7), both with a distance of 9.\n\nThat seems pretty far. Maybe I should consider moving down towards the cluster of apples at (8,7) and (8,5).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (1,9) to (8,7), which is a distance of 7 right and 2 down.\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, it's at (4,1) with its body at (5,1).
