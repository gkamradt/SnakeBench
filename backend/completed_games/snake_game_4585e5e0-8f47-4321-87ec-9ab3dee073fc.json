Although the ultimate goal is to access the row closer to the apples (y = 7 to 9), a direct upward movement from the immediate last position could be fatal due to implications of hitting snake #1.\n- Instead, a safe and optimal move would be to start heading RIGHT to begin our eastern progression while not increasing the risk with a straight upward move.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n- RIGHT. This move will begin to address the gap in horizontal distance to the apples while avoiding any direct collision upwards, based on the last stated position of snake #1. The strategy in upcoming turns will need to balance upward and further rightward movements to align directly beneath the apples for subsequent vertical moves."

It helps align vertically closer to many of the apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 5) is also safe but does not bring me closer to any apples. Since the apples are primarily located further up, focusing efforts to move upwards is tactically sound.\n\n**Forward Planning:**\n- After moving to (1, 6) by going UP, continuing to move upwards while cautiously shifting right should be the approach to eventually reach the dense cluster at row 8. Attaining these apples would provide crucial growth and scoring opportunities. This long-term objective should include watching for movements from enemy snake (#1) and any new game developments such as new apples or other snakes.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n- **UP**. This move aligns with capturing the higher positioned apples and it distances safely from other threats while utilizing the vertical space efficiently. Future plans will consider more horizontal shifts to the right when closer to the apples."

If safe, an upward movement will be crucial.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n- **RIGHT**. Moving to (3, 6) as the apple positions are potentially reachable with further planned moves up next turns."

It\u2019s essential to keep a distance or predict its next move to avoid collisions.\n- I need to be wary of cornering myself or potentially heading into a blind spot with limited escape routes.\n\n**Strategic Next Steps:**\n- Once reaching (4, 7), assessing the situation with respect to the enemy's position and potential reach of the apple at (6, 7) will be crucial. Adjustments might be essential based on whether Snake #1 heads downward or continues its current trajectory.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 7). This aligns with approaching the nearest apple at (6, 7) while maintaining agility to adjust route based on enemy movements and other board dynamics. This also keeps a future potential upward move to collect the apple at (4, 9) in play.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

If I move **DOWN to (5, 7)**, I might be opening myself to slower growth since it further distances from the apples above while potentially mustering a path either to other unlooked apples or keep out of enemy's line.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves:\nThis means I should focus on assessing where I can grow while also safely outmaneuvering the enemy.

Although the ultimate goal is to access the row closer to the apples (y = 7 to 9), a direct upward movement from the immediate last position could be fatal due to implications of hitting snake #1.\n- Instead, a safe and optimal move would be to start heading RIGHT to begin our eastern progression while not increasing the risk with a straight upward move.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n- RIGHT. This move will begin to address the gap in horizontal distance to the apples while avoiding any direct collision upwards, based on the last stated position of snake #1.

Its body position suggests it might also try to move north to capture it. I need to be cautious but can potentially benefit from apples they don\u2019t target immediately.\n\n**Risks and Considerations:**\n- Risk of collision is minimized as no bodies of Snake #1 are in my direct planned path. However, keeping a watch on their movements is essential to avoid any sudden confrontations.\n- Going back (LEFT) or down (DOWN) doesn\u2019t align with the strategic goal of collecting apples.\n\n**Strategic Future Planning:**\n- After heading to the right and hopefully managing to get to (4, 7) in a couple of moves, I should reassess based on the available positions of Snake #1 and remaining apples. Should opportunities arise to safely move north (UP), capturing the apple at (4, 9) could be a logical next step.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n- **RIGHT**.

It helps align vertically closer to many of the apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 5) is also safe but does not bring me closer to any apples. Since the apples are primarily located further up, focusing efforts to move upwards is tactically sound.\n\n**Forward Planning:**\n- After moving to (1, 6) by going UP, continuing to move upwards while cautiously shifting right should be the approach to eventually reach the dense cluster at row 8.

It helps align vertically closer to many of the apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 5) is also safe but does not bring me closer to any apples. Since the apples are primarily located further up, focusing efforts to move upwards is tactically sound.\n\n**Forward Planning:**\n- After moving to (1, 6) by going UP, continuing to move upwards while cautiously shifting right should be the approach to eventually reach the dense cluster at row 8. Attaining these apples would provide crucial growth and scoring opportunities. This long-term objective should include watching for movements from enemy snake (#1) and any new game developments such as new apples or other snakes.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n- **UP**. This move aligns with capturing the higher positioned apples and it distances safely from other threats while utilizing the vertical space efficiently. Future plans will consider more horizontal shifts to the right when closer to the apples."

From (7,7) if you move RIGHT, you will be adjacent to an apple at (8,8) which you can consume on a subsequent move.\n2. Moving UP puts you near the head of Snake #1 (8,9), increasing the risk of a direct collision should it opt to move DOWN or towards you in subsequent moves.\n3. Moving LEFT or DOWN is unnecessary as there is no immediate benefit or apple to consume and could potentially limit your movement options later.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- Moving RIGHT (to 8,7) is a strategic choice to position yourself optimally to eat the apple at (8,8) on the next turn.\n- Watch Snake #1's movement, especially its potential to move SOUTH from (8,9) to (8,8), which would directly threaten your plan to get the apple at that position. If you see this potential movement as a threat, consider changing your next move accordingly.\n\n**Planned Next Steps:**\n- **This turn:** Move RIGHT to (8, 7) to set up for eating the apple at (8, 8) next.\n- **Next turn:** Depending on whether Snake #1 moves downward, either proceed UP to (8, 8) to eat the apple or adjust your strategy based on the enemy snake's position and other factors like potential wall or self collisions.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**\n\nThis move secures a geographical advantage, ensures safe growth, and utilizes the apples nearby effectively while keeping a safe distance from enemy threats."
