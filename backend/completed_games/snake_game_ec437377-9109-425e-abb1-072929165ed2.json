I had planned to move toward the apple locations while staying safe from enemy snakes.\n\n### Board State\n- My Position: (6, 4) (current position)\n- Apples: (0, 0), (3, 7), (2, 5), (9, 2), (8, 0)\n- Enemy Snake: (8, 1) with body at [(8, 0)]\n\n### Possible Moves from My Current Position (6, 4)\n1. **UP to (6, 5)**: This position is open but leads back to my previous position and doesn\u2019t advance toward apples.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 3)**: This is also open but does not move toward any apple.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 4)**: This is open and would move me into an area with more possibilities to reach the apple at (2, 5).\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 4)**: This position is open, but it moves away from the lower x-coordinates that could potentially access more apples.\n\n### Observations\n- The UP move doesn\u2019t help as it effectively keeps me in the same spot of the game.\n- DOWN is not beneficial since it puts me further away from apples.\n- LEFT is strategically useful as it gets me into a position where I can potentially move toward apples in the next turns without running into the enemy.\n- RIGHT is not desirable as it moves away from constraining my path to the apples I want.\n\n### Strategic Goals\n1. **Prioritize Apples**: As I mentioned, I want to work towards the apple at (2, 5).\n2. **Maintain Flexibility**: While pursuing apples, I need to remain open to reacting to the enemy snake and ensuring I don't corner myself.\n3. **Control Board Space**: Move into areas where I can maximize choices in my next moves.\n\n### Decision\nMoving LEFT to (5, 4) establishes a more advantageous position for future turns, allowing me to strategize my moves better in pursuit of the apples without putting myself in danger from walls or the enemy snake.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: LEFT."

Therefore, I should go **UP** to (6, 5) this time, keeping future movement options more open.\n\n### My Strategy for Next Turn\n- Prioritize getting to (2, 5) by potentially checking what the next move will be after UP.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s movements to ensure I do not get cornered.\n\nDecided next move: **UP**."

They are quite far from my current position, which means I don't have to worry about them blocking my immediate moves.\n\n### Possible Moves\nFrom my current position **(5, 7)**, I consider the following options:\n1. **UP to (5, 8):** This position is free, but there are no apples nearby, and it may not provide strategic advantages.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 6):** This is also free but does not provide access to an apple.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 7):** This is moving backward to my previous position, which is not advantageous.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 7):** This is free but does not lead towards any apples.\n\n### Analysis\n- **UP** doesn\u2019t provide me direct access to an apple, and keeps me at the same column.\n- **DOWN** is clear, but I still don't get closer to any apples and may risk getting boxed out in a future turn.\n- **LEFT** is ineffective as it reverses my progress.\n- **RIGHT** allows movement, but again does not directly approach any apples.\n\n### Decision\nThe apple at **(5, 4)** is just one step down from my position, making **DOWN to (5, 6)** the most beneficial move. This would set me up to collect the apple at **(5, 4)** on my next turn.\n\n### Conclusion\nNext move: DOWN to (5, 6).\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

It leads me away from the apples.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 4):** This square is free, but also does not have an apple. \n4. **RIGHT to (6, 4):** This square is free, but again does not lead towards any apples.\n\n### Strategy and Decision Making\nSince moving **UP** is not possible and the moves **DOWN**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT** do not lead me toward collecting more apples, I need to carefully consider my next move.\n\n**Immediate Strategy:**\nI should consider trying to reposition towards the next viable apple target. The apple at (2, 5) is my next best option since it would be a step towards the left and up. However, the nearest accessible point heading towards that direction may require moving around the board effectively.\n\nAfter weighing my options:\n- \nMoving **LEFT to (4, 4)** does not facilitate immediate apple access, but it could open pathways in further turns without risking my current position against snakes.\n- \nMoving **RIGHT to (6, 4)** may reveal potential strategic positions that could lead towards the upper part of the board, since it gives me the flexibility to navigate upwards and towards the apple at (2, 5) later on.\n\nGiven that I want to keep my mobility open but also want to ensure I keep strategizing towards apple acquisition:\n\nDecided next move: **RIGHT** to (6, 4). \n\nThis allows me to grow my reach on the board, adjust positions, and reassess my next possible moves towards apples."

On the other hand, moving up and left towards the center of the board would give me more flexibility and room to maneuver in the future turns.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After getting the apple at (8, 0), I should focus on moving back towards the center of the board to maintain flexibility and avoid getting trapped in a corner.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

Since I am just one move away from (3, 7), I can either check or block the way for the enemy on my next move while staying attentive to movement opportunities.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nLEFT to (5, 7) to prepare for accessibility to move UP to (3, 7) in future turns.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

Cannot move here.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 4):** The square is free and contains an apple. This is the preferred move.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 5):** This square is free but does not lead towards an apple. \n4. **RIGHT to (6, 5):** This square is also free but similarly does not lead towards an apple.\n\n### Decision\nMoving **DOWN** to **(5, 4)** is the only move that allows me to collect an apple. This will enable me to grow my snake, increase my score, and make me stronger on future turns.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter collecting the apple at **(5, 4)**, I should assess my surroundings to see the best path towards other apples. The immediate next target could be the apple at **(2, 5)**, but I need to ensure I keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential conflict.\n\n### Conclusion\nDecided next move: DOWN"

The apple at (2, 5) is my next best option since it would be a step towards the left and up.

I had planned to move toward the apple locations while staying safe from enemy snakes.\n\n### Board State\n- My Position: (6, 4) (current position)\n- Apples: (0, 0), (3, 7), (2, 5), (9, 2), (8, 0)\n- Enemy Snake: (8, 1) with body at [(8, 0)]\n\n### Possible Moves from My Current Position (6, 4)\n1. **UP to (6, 5)**: This position is open but leads back to my previous position and doesn\u2019t advance toward apples.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 3)**: This is also open but does not move toward any apple.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 4)**: This is open and would move me into an area with more possibilities to reach the apple at (2, 5).\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 4)**: This position is open, but it moves away from the lower x-coordinates that could potentially access more apples.\n\n### Observations\n- The UP move doesn\u2019t help as it effectively keeps me in the same spot of the game.\n- DOWN is not beneficial since it puts me further away from apples.\n- LEFT is strategically useful as it gets me into a position where I can potentially move toward apples in the next turns without running into the enemy.\n- RIGHT is not desirable as it moves away from constraining my path to the apples I want.\n\n### Strategic Goals\n1. **Prioritize Apples**: As I mentioned, I want to work towards the apple at (2, 5).\n2. **Maintain Flexibility**: While pursuing apples, I need to remain open to reacting to the enemy snake and ensuring I don't corner myself.\n3. **Control Board Space**: Move into areas where I can maximize choices in my next moves.\n\n### Decision\nMoving LEFT to (5, 4) establishes a more advantageous position for future turns, allowing me to strategize my moves better in pursuit of the apples without putting myself in danger from walls or the enemy snake.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: LEFT."
