(Remember, even though our previous message mistakenly called (6,2) an apple, (6,2) is actually enemy snake #2\u2019s head.)\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances from (7,7):\n\u2022 (1,6): |7\u20131| + |7\u20136| = 6 + 1 = 7  \n\u2022 (2,5): |7\u20132| + |7\u20135| = 5 + 2 = 7  \n\u2022 (9,0): |7\u20139| + |7\u20130| = 2 + 7 = 9  \n\u2022 (1,2): |7\u20131| + |7\u20132| = 6 + 5 = 11  \n\u2022 (5,3): |7\u20135| + |7\u20133| = 2 + 4 = 6  \n\nThus, the apple at (5,3) is our closest target with a Manhattan distance 6.\n\nFrom (7,7) our legal moves (remember, we cannot reverse onto our own body \u2013 going UP would hit our neck at (7,8)) are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nLet\u2019s check the moves relative to our target (5,3):\n\n\u2022 DOWN to (7,6):\n\u2003Distance = |7\u20135| + |6\u20133| = 2 + 3 = 5  \n\u2022 LEFT to (6,7):\n\u2003Distance = |6\u20135| + |7\u20133| = 1 + 4 = 5  \n\u2022 RIGHT to (8,7):\n\u2003Distance = |8\u20135| + |7\u20133| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN reduce the Manhattan distance from 6 to 5; RIGHT increases it.\n\nThere are no nearby walls or enemy collisions in either (6,7) or (7,6). Choosing LEFT starts to reduce our horizontal gap toward (5,3) quicker (we need to cover a difference of 2 along x and 4 along y). With (7,7) going LEFT to (6,7) we cut the x gap to 1 while still keeping our vertical gap at 4 \u2013 a good step toward our target.\n\nThus, I decide to move LEFT.\n\nStrategic note for future turns:\n\u2022 Continue evaluating moves that reduce the distance to the nearest apple.\n\u2022 Keep an eye on enemy snake positions to avoid head-to-head risks.\n\u2022 Plan a route that allows steady closing of both the x and y gaps.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
