However, further moves would need to be navigated carefully, potentially DOWN thereafter to reach these apples.\n2. **Other Directions:**\n   - **UP**: Moving up to (9, 6) shifts away from strategically favorable positions relative to apples' locations.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving down from (9, 5) to (9, 4) doesn't bring the snake closer to any nearby apples.\n   - **RIGHT**: This direction is not feasible, as moving right would only involve hitting the wall at (10, 5).\n\n**Immediate Strategy:**\nFocus on securing the nearby apple at position (8, 2) while avoiding unnecessary movement away from apple-rich areas and maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. The best immediate move thus appears to be **LEFT**, bringing the snake into direct alignment with the apples at a lower y-coordinate.

However, further moves would need to be navigated carefully, potentially DOWN thereafter to reach these apples.\n2. **Other Directions:**\n   - **UP**: Moving up to (9, 6) shifts away from strategically favorable positions relative to apples' locations.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving down from (9, 5) to (9, 4) doesn't bring the snake closer to any nearby apples.\n   - **RIGHT**: This direction is not feasible, as moving right would only involve hitting the wall at (10, 5).\n\n**Immediate Strategy:**\nFocus on securing the nearby apple at position (8, 2) while avoiding unnecessary movement away from apple-rich areas and maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. The best immediate move thus appears to be **LEFT**, bringing the snake into direct alignment with the apples at a lower y-coordinate. Subsequent moves should then be DOWN to secure the apple at (8, 2) and possibly further DOWN to (8, 0). Monitor enemy activity to adjust plan as necessary.\n\n**Next Move Decision: LEFT** - This should ideally position the snake for subsequent efficient moves to capture the nearby apples while avoiding the enemy snake and board edges. Adjust tactics based on fresh positions and the enemy movements in the next turn update."
