This move also sets up the snake to move left on the subsequent turn to collect the apple at (5, 7). If Snake #1 moves left, right, or stays in place, the snake can still safely move to (5, 7) after moving down to (5, 9).\n\nIf Snake #1 moves down, the snake will need to reassess the situation. However, moving down to (5, 9) still keeps the snake safe for the next turn and allows for a flexible strategy.\n\nTherefore, the next move is:\n\nDOWN to position (5, 9). \n\nStrategy for the next turn: Move LEFT to collect the apple at (5, 7) unless Snake #1 moves in a way that would make this unsafe, in which case a new strategy will be needed."

The next move should be aimed at collecting the apple at (5, 7) while ensuring safety from Snake #1 and avoiding self-collision.\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 7) with its body at (5, 6). This means that if Snake #1 does not move, its head will occupy the space where the apple is located, making it unsafe for our snake to move there directly. However, if Snake #1 moves in any direction except up, it will vacate the space, allowing our snake to safely move to (5, 7) and collect the apple.\n\nSince we cannot predict the enemy snake's move, we should choose a move that maximizes our safety and potential apple collection while keeping our options open for the next turn. The best move in this situation is to position our snake one step away from the apple, allowing us to collect it on the next turn regardless of Snake #1's move, as long as it does not move directly into our path.\n\nTherefore, the next move is:\n\nDOWN to position (5, 8), which is directly above the apple at (5, 7). This move avoids any immediate collision with Snake #1 and sets up the snake to collect the apple on the next turn, regardless of whether Snake #1 moves left, right, or stays in place. If Snake #1 moves down into the space where our snake currently is, we can then move left to collect the apple, as Snake #1's body will no longer be in the way.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Move LEFT to collect the apple at (5, 7) if Snake #1 moves left, right, or stays in place. If Snake #1 moves down into our current position, move UP to collect the apple at (5, 7).\n\nEnding the response with the decided next move: DOWN."
