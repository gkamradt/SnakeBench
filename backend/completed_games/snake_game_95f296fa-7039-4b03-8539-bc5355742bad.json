However, moving to (5, 2) keeps my options open for the following moves since I could aim towards (6, 5) or (4, 4) on the next turn.\n\nI need to think about a longer-term strategy now. The best way to start would be to move up to (5, 2) to evaluate the board layout better and set myself up to aim toward the apples on the next turns.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move:\n**UP**."

I see a few apples nearby, but I also need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake #1 at (5, 1).\n\nMy initial thought is to try to get closer to the apples, but I don't want to risk going too far and getting into a corner where I'm trapped. I also don't want to go too close to the enemy snake, as that could be a recipe for disaster.\n\nI think I'll try to move... RIGHT. This will allow me to stay relatively safe and potentially get closer to the apples. I can reassess my options from there.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
