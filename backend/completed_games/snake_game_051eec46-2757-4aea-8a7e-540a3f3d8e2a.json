Considering a shift towards (6, 8) or other opportune apples that appear viable.\n- Continue prioritizing safety and maximizing points by strategically planning movements that minimize risk encounters with walls or other snakes while maximizing apple collection.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT (Moving from (8, 3) to (7, 3) to acquire the apple at (7, 2) next)."
