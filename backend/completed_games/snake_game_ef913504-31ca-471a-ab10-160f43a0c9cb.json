However, enemy snake #2 is quite distant, hence I don't have to worry about collisions as of now. After consuming the apple at (2, 0), I will have to head left to eat the apple at (1, 0). From there, my path to the apples on the right top corner of the board is cleared but I have to be mindful of the walls as I make the sharp turn. Despite these obstacles, claiming these apples seems to be the best approach for earning points and simultaneously staying safe.\n\nTo avoid running into my own body or the walls after eating the apple at (2, 0), I will move left the next turn and try to get to apple at (1, 0), followed by a right turn to claim the apples at (8, 0) and (9, 1). \n\nDecided next move: DOWN."
