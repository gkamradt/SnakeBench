The apple at (9, 8) is to the right of my current position but at the same y-coordinate. The apple at (4, 9) is below and slightly to the left of my position and is the only apple on the same column as me (x = 6).\n\n2. Considering Potential Threats:\n   - Snake #2 is at position (0, 2), which, considering it has no body pieces, currently poses no direct threat near my position.\n\n3. Evaluating Move Consequences:\n   - Moving up to (6, 9) gets me close to both the apple at (4, 9) and potentially sets a path towards (9, 8) unless blocked off.\n   - Moving right to (7, 8) or left to (5, 8) doesn't immediately provide access to any apples, and I would have to navigate further.\n   - Moving down to (6, 7) moves further away from nearby apples and doesn't seem beneficial.\n\n4. Strategic Choice:\n   - Moving up seems optimal as it gets me nearer to the apple at (4, 9), after which I can potentially aim to move toward the apple at (9, 8). This choice also maintains a good positioning against potential enemy movements, keeping central mobility open.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- After moving up (to (6, 9) this turn and acquiring the apple at (4, 9)), I should analyze whether to go left toward apple at (3, 5) or aim for the right side toward apple at (9, 8), considering the enemy's position and next movement.\n\n**Decided next move: UP.**"

This will get me a point while avoiding any collisions.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
