My main goal is to find an apple to grow and gain points.\n\nI see that there's an apple at (0, 1) which is relatively close to me. I can try to move towards it. However, I also need to consider the enemy snakes. Snake #1 is at (2, 1) and has no body, so it's not a threat. But I should be cautious of the other snakes.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the apple at (0, 1) while keeping an eye on the other snakes.\n\nMy decided next move is: RIGHT."
