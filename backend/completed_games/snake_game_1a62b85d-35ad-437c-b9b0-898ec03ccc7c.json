            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,6). There are apples at (8,8), (3,2), (6,8), (4,4), and (1,3). Enemy snake number 1 is at (0,2) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots (empty)\n\nRow 8: dots except at (8,8) and (9,8) which have apples\n\nRow 7: all dots\n\nRow 6: dots except at (7,7) which has my snake (2)\n\nRow 5: all dots\n\nRow 4: dots except at (4,4) which has an apple\n\nRow 3: dots except at (1,3) which has an apple\n\nRow 2: snake 1 at (0,2), apple at (3,2)\n\nRow 1: all dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board state you provided, it seems like the Y-axis increases upwards, with (0,0) at the bottom left.\n\nSo, the board looks like this:\n\n- Row 9 (top): all dots\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (8,8) and (6,8) which have apples\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots except at (7,6) which has my snake (2)\n\n- Row 5: all dots\n\n- Row 4: dots except at (4,4) which has an apple\n\n- Row 3: dots except at (1,3) which has an apple\n\n- Row 2: snake 1 at (0,2), apple at (3,2)\n\n- Row 1: all dots\n\n- Row 0: all dots\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,6), and there are apples at (8,8), (6,8), (4,4), (1,3), and (3,2). Enemy snake 1 is at (0,2).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple. My current position is (7,6). The apples are at:\n\n- (8,8): that's up and to the right\n\n- (6,8): up and to the left\n\n- (4,4): up and to the left\n\n- (1,3): up and to the left\n\n- (3,2): up and to the left\n\nWait, actually, let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (8,8): |8-7| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (6,8): |6-7| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (4,4): |4-7| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (1,3): |1-7| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (8,8) and (6,8), both with a distance of 3.\n\nNow, which one should I go for first? Maybe the one that's less crowded or closer to other apples.\n\nLooking at (8,8):\n\n- It's in the top-right corner.\n\n- There's another apple at (6,8), which is two steps left from there.\n\n- So, if I go to (8,8), I can potentially pick up (6,8) next by moving left.\n\nLooking at (6,8):\n\n- It's two steps up and one step left from my current position.\n\n- From there, I can go to (8,8) by moving right and up, but that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (4,4):\n\n- It's somewhat central, but farther away.\n\n- Might be better to go for the cluster of apples at (8,8) and (6,8) first.\n\nAlso, I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (0,2). It's on the left side of the board, and since its body is empty, it's just the head there.\n\nI need to make sure not to run into it. Hopefully, it won't be in my way as I go for the apples on the right.\n\nLet me think about possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Go for (8,8) first.\n\nFrom (7,6):\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move right to (8,7)\n\n- Move up to (8,8)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nThen, from (8,8), move left to (7,8), then (6,8) to pick up the other apple.\n\nWait, but (6,8) is at (6,8), which is left and up from my current position.\n\nWait, actually, from (8,8), to get to (6,8), I need to move left twice: to (7,8), then (6,8).\n\nSo, total moves: up, right, up, left, left.\n\nThat seems a bit long. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,8).\n\nFrom (7,6):\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move left to (6,7)\n\n- Move up to (6,8)\n\nThat's three moves as well.\n\nThen, from (6,8), I can go right to (7,8), then up to (8,8) to get the other apple.\n\nSo, total moves: up, left, up, right, up.\n\nStill five moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a path that allows me to pick up both apples in fewer moves.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I go to (6,8) first:\n\n- up to (7,7)\n\n- left to (6,7)\n\n- up to (6,8) -> pick up apple\n\n- right to (7,8)\n\n- up to (8,8) -> pick up apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nAlternatively, go to (8,8) first:\n\n- up to (7,7)\n\n- right to (8,7)\n\n- up to (8,8) -> pick up apple\n\n- left to (7,8)\n\n- left to (6,8) -> pick up apple\n\nAlso five moves.\n\nSo, similar in terms of move count.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is safer, in terms of avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0,2). It's quite far from where I am, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAssuming it moves towards me, but snakes can only move to adjacent cells, and they can't occupy the same cell as another snake.\n\nSo, as long as I don't move into its path, I should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can predict where it might go based on the apples.\n\nBut, given that it's just the head with no body, and it's at (0,2), while the apples are mostly on the right side, it might be trying to go for the apple at (3,2).\n\nIf it does, it would need to move right towards (3,2).\n\nBut, I'm on the right side, so maybe it won't interfere with my path immediately.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I can prioritize going for the apples on the right.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat apples, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to\u649e\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\n\nBut right now, I'm just the head, so no body to worry about yet.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, you leave a trail, and that becomes your body.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, you grow, meaning your tail doesn't retract.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can grow by eating apples, I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nBut in the initial state, I'm just the head at (7,6), so no body parts yet.\n\nAssuming that when I move, my head moves to a new cell, and the previous head cell becomes the new body part.\n\nIf I eat an apple, my tail stays the same, effectively making my snake longer.\n\nBut I need to confirm the exact mechanics.\n\nWait, in standard Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail does not retract, so your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, in this game, if I eat an apple, my snake will grow in length by one cell.\n\nTherefore, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body as I move.\n\nBut right now, since I'm just the head, I don't have any body parts yet.\n\nSo, for the first move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own body.\n\nOnly after I eat an apple will I have a body to watch out for.\n\nWait,"

So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots (empty)\n\nRow 8: dots except at (8,8) and (6,8) which have apples\n\nRow 7: all dots\n\nRow 6: dots except at (7,6) which has my snake (2)\n\nRow 5: all dots\n\nRow 4: dots except at (4,4) which has an apple\n\nRow 3: dots except at (1,3) which has an apple\n\nRow 2: snake 1 at (0,2), apple at (3,2)\n\nRow 1: all dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board state you provided, it seems like the Y-axis increases upwards, with (0,0) at the bottom left.\n\nSo, the board looks like this:\n\n- Row 9 (top): all dots\n\n- Row 8: dots except at (8,8) and (6,8) which have apples\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: dots except at (7,6) which has my snake (2)\n\n- Row 5: all dots\n\n- Row 4: dots except at (4,4) which has an apple\n\n- Row 3: dots except at (1,3) which has an apple\n\n- Row 2: snake 1 at (0,2), apple at (3,2)\n\n- Row 1: all dots\n\n- Row 0: all dots\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,6), and there are apples at (8,8), (6,8), (4,4), (1,3), and (3,2). Enemy snake 1 is at (0,2).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple. My current position is (7,6). The apples are at:\n\n- (8,8): that's up and to the right\n\n- (6,8): up and to the left\n\n- (4,4): up and to the left\n\n- (1,3): up and to the left\n\n- (3,2): up and to the left\n\nWait, actually, let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (8,8): |8-7| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (6,8): |6-7| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (4,4): |4-7| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (1,3): |1-7| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (8,8) and (6,8), both with a distance of 3.\n\nNow, which one should I go for first? Maybe the one that's less crowded or closer to other apples.\n\nLooking at (8,8):\n\n- It's in the top-right corner.\n\n- There's another apple at (6,8), which is two steps left from there.\n\n- So, if I go to (8,8), I can potentially pick up (6,8) next by moving left.\n\nLooking at (6,8):\n\n- It's two steps up and one step left from my current position.\n\n- From there, I can go to (8,8) by moving right and up, but that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (4,4):\n\n- It's somewhat central, but farther away.\n\n- Might be better to go for the cluster of apples at (8,8) and (6,8) first.\n\nAlso, I need to be careful of the enemy snake at (0,2). It's on the left side of the board, and since its body is empty, it's just the head there.\n\nI need to make sure not to run into it. Hopefully, it won't be in my way as I go for the apples on the right.\n\nLet me think about possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Go for (8,8) first.\n\nFrom (7,6):\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move right to (8,7)\n\n- Move up to (8,8)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nThen, from (8,8), move left to (7,8), then (6,8) to pick up the other apple.\n\nWait, but (6,8) is at (6,8), which is left and up from my current position.\n\nWait, actually, from (8,8), to get to (6,8), I need to move left twice: to (7,8), then (6,8).\n\nSo, total moves: up, right, up, left, left.\n\nThat seems a bit long. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,8).\n\nFrom (7,6):\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move left to (6,7)\n\n- Move up to (6,8)\n\nThat's three moves as well.\n\nThen, from (6,8), I can go right to (7,8), then up to (8,8) to get the other apple.\n\nSo, total moves: up, left, up, right, up.\n\nStill five moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a path that allows me to pick up both apples in fewer moves.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I go to (6,8) first:\n\n- up to (7,7)\n\n- left to (6,7)\n\n- up to (6,8) -> pick up apple\n\n- right to (7,8)\n\n- up to (8,8) -> pick up apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nAlternatively, go to (8,8) first:\n\n- up to (7,7)\n\n- right to (8,7)\n\n- up to (8,8) -> pick up apple\n\n- left to (7,8)\n\n- left to (6,8) -> pick up apple\n\nAlso five moves.\n\nSo, similar in terms of move count.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is safer, in terms of avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0,2). It's quite far from where I am, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAssuming it moves towards me, but snakes can only move to adjacent cells, and they can't occupy the same cell as another snake.\n\nSo, as long as I don't move into its path, I should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can predict where it might go based on the apples.\n\nBut, given that it's just the head with no body, and it's at (0,2), while the apples are mostly on the right side, it might be trying to go for the apple at (3,2).\n\nIf it does, it would need to move right towards (3,2).\n\nBut, I'm on the right side, so maybe it won't interfere with my path immediately.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I can prioritize going for the apples on the right.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat apples, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to\u649e\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\n\nBut right now, I'm just the head, so no body parts yet.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, you leave a trail, and that becomes your body.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, you grow, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can grow by eating apples, I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nBut in the initial state, I'm just the head at (7,6), so no body parts yet.\n\nAssuming that when I move, my head moves to a new cell, and the previous head cell becomes the new body part.\n\nIf I eat an apple, my tail stays the same, effectively making my snake longer.\n\nBut I need to confirm the exact mechanics.\n\nWait, in standard Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows in length by one cell.\n\nSo, in this game, if I eat an apple, my snake will grow in length by one cell.\n\nTherefore, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body as I move.\n\nBut right now, since I'm just the head, I don't have any body parts yet.\n\nSo, for the first move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own body.\n\nOnly after I eat an apple will I have a body to watch out for.\n\nWait, in the previous move, I"

It's quite far from where I am, and it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nAssuming it moves towards me, but snakes can only move to adjacent cells, and they can't occupy the same cell as another snake.\n\nSo, as long as I don't move into its path, I should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can predict where it might go based on the apples.\n\nBut, given that it's just the head with no body, and it's at (0,2), while the apples are mostly on the right side, it might be trying to go for the apple at (3,2).\n\nIf it does, it would need to move right towards (3,2).\n\nBut, I'm on the right side, so maybe it won't interfere with my path immediately.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I can prioritize going for the apples on the right.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat apples, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to\u649e\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\n\nBut right now, I'm just the head, so no body parts yet.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, you leave a trail, and that becomes your body.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, you grow, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can grow by eating apples, I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nBut in the initial state, I'm just the head at (7,6), so no body parts yet.\n\nAssuming that when I move, my head moves to a new cell, and the previous head cell becomes the new body part.\n\nIf I eat an apple, my tail stays the same, effectively making my snake longer.\n\nBut I need to confirm the exact mechanics.\n\nWait, in standard Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows in length by one cell.\n\nSo, in this game, if I eat an apple, my snake will grow in length by one cell.\n\nTherefore, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body as I move.\n\nBut right now, since I'm just the head, I don't have any body parts yet.\n\nSo, for the first move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own body.\n\nOnly after I eat an apple will I have a body to watch out for.\n\nWait, in the previous move, I"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,6), and it's snake number 2. There are apples at (8,8), (6,8), (4,4), (1,3), and (3,2). There's also an enemy snake at (0,2), which is snake number 1, and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nI need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat as many apples as possible without dying, which means not running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nI'm at (7,6). The apples are at:\n\n- (8,8): that's up and to the right\n\n- (6,8): up and to the left\n\n- (4,4): up and to the left\n\n- (1,3): up and to the left\n\n- (3,2): up and to the left\n\nWait, actually, let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple to see which one is closest.\n\n- (8,8): |8-7| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (6,8): |6-7| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (4,4): |4-7| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (1,3): |1-7| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (3,2): |3-7| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (8,8) and (6,8), both with a distance of 3.\n\nNow, I need to decide which one to go for first. Maybe I should go for the one that's less crowded or the one that can lead me closer to other apples.\n\nLooking at (8,8):\n\n- It's in the top-right corner.\n\n- There's another apple at (6,8), which is two steps left from there.\n\n- So, if I go to (8,8), I can potentially pick up (6,8) next by moving left.\n\nAlternatively, going to (6,8) first:\n\n- It's up and to the left.\n\n- From there, I can go to (8,8) by moving right and up.\n\nHmm, both paths seem similar in terms of move counts.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0,2), which is on the left side of the board. Since it's just the head and no body parts, it's probably not a immediate threat, but I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for the apples on the right side first would be safer, as the enemy is on the left.\n\nSo, let's consider going for (8,8) first.\n\nFrom (7,6):\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move right to (8,7)\n\n- Move up to (8,8)\n\nThat's three moves to get to (8,8).\n\nThen, from (8,8), I can move left to (7,8), then (6,8) to pick up the other apple.\n\nSo, total moves to get both (8,8) and (6,8) would be five moves.\n\nAlternatively, going for (6,8) first:\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move left to (6,7)\n\n- Move up to (6,8)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nThen, from (6,8), move right to (7,8), then up to (8,8).\n\nAgain, five moves in total.\n\nSo, in terms of move count, both paths are equal.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path has fewer obstacles or is safer.\n\nGiven that the enemy is on the left, going right might be safer initially.\n\nBut, I also need to think about the longer term.\n\nAfter eating (8,8) and (6,8), the next closest apple is at (4,4), which is at a distance of 5 from my current position.\n\nWait, from (6,8), the distance to (4,4) is:\n\n|4-6| + |4-8| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, it's a bit farther.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,8), the distance to (4,4) is:\n\n|4-8| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nWhich is even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nPerhaps go for (6,8), then (8,8), then (4,4).\n\nLet's calculate the total moves:\n\n- From (7,6) to (6,8): up to (7,7), left to (6,7), up to (6,8) -> 3 moves\n\n- From (6,8) to (8,8): right to (7,8), up to (8,8) -> 2 moves\n\n- From (8,8) to (4,4): down to (8,7), left to (7,7), down to (7,6), left to (6,6), down to (6,5), left to (5,5), down to (5,4), left to (4,4) -> that's 8 moves\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 2 + 8 = 13 moves\n\nAlternatively, go for (8,8) first:\n\n- From (7,6) to (8,8): up to (7,7), right to (8,7), up to (8,8) -> 3 moves\n\n- From (8,8) to (6,8): left to (7,8), left to (6,8) -> 2 moves\n\n- From (6,8) to (4,4): down to (6,7), left to (5,7), down to (5,6), left to (4,6), down to (4,5), left to (3,5), down to (3,4), left to (2,4), down to (2,3), left to (1,3), down to (1,2), left to (0,2) -> that's 11 moves\n\nWait, that seems too many. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (6,8) to (4,4):\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Left to (5,7)\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\n- Down to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Left to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Left to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Left to (0,2)\n\nYes, that's 11 moves.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,8) to (4,4):\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Left to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\n- Down to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Left to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Left to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Left to (0,2)\n\nStill 11 moves.\n\nHmm, perhaps going for (4,4) earlier would be better.\n\nLet me consider going for (4,4) first.\n\nFrom (7,6):\n\n- Up to (7,7)\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Up to (6,8)\n\n- Left to (5,8)\n\n- Down to (5,7)\n\n- Left to (4,7)\n\n- Down to (4,6)\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5)\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Left to (1,4)\n\n- Down to (1,3) -> that's 12 moves\n\nThat's a lot of moves. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, go for (1,3):\n\n- Up to (7,7)\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Left to (5,6)\n\n- Down to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Down to (4,4)\n\n- Left to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (1,3) -> that's 10 moves\n\nStill quite a few moves.\n\nIt seems that the apples on the right are closer, so maybe prioritizing those is better.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI have apples at (8,8), (6,8), (4,4), ("
