            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I want to figure out my next move. Let me look at the information I have here. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (9,6). \n\nThere are some apples on the board at the following positions: (8,9), (3,4), (5,9), (0,8), and (7,1). My snake is at (9,6), and there's another enemy snake, ID 2, at (0,6) with an empty body. The board state shows where the apples and snakes are placed.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move next. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I have to be careful not to hit any walls, the other snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should plot the positions to get a better visual. My snake is at (9,6), which is the rightmost column (x=9) and row 6. Looking at the apples, the closest ones might be the best targets to go after. Let me list them:\n\n- (8,9): That's two units up and one to the left from my current position.\n- (3,4): That's far to the left and down, which might be too far.\n- (5,9): That's even further left but up.\n- (0,8): That's way to the left and up, which is probably too far.\n- (7,1): That's to the left and way down.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be at (8,9). It's one step to the left and two steps up from my current position. That might be a good target to move towards.\n\nBut wait, moving from (9,6) to (8,9) would require going left once and up twice. Alternatively, I can go up first and then left, but I need to be careful about the walls and any possible collisions.\n\nLet me think about the directions:\n\n- Moving UP from (9,6) would take me to (9,7). That's safe because there's no wall there; the top wall is at y=9.\n- Moving RIGHT would take me to (10,6), which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. I can't move right; it's blocked.\n- Moving DOWN would take me to (9,5). That's possible, but I don't see an apple there.\n- Moving LEFT would take me to (8,6). That's within the board, and (8,9) is an apple two steps up from there.\n\nSo, moving left to (8,6) seems like a good first step because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,9). From there, I can proceed upwards towards the apple.\n\nWait, but what about the other apples? The apple at (3,4) is quite far. I should focus on the nearest one because moving towards it would give me a point quickly and help me grow, which is better for future moves.\n\nAlso, I should check if there's any enemy snake nearby that might block me. Snake #2 is at (0,6), which is far away on the left side at the same y-coordinate. So, it's not in my immediate path towards (8,9). Therefore, I don't have to worry about it right now.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the wall. Moving right from (9,6) would make me go to (10,6), which is outside the board. So I must avoid moving right.\n\nSo, the plan is to move left to (8,6), then up to (8,7), and then up again to (8,8), and then up to (8,9) to get the apple. That's four moves, but I need to make sure each move is safe.\n\nWait, but my next move is just the first step. So, in this turn, I should move LEFT to (8,6). \n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any obstacle between (9,6) and (8,6)? According to the board state, at (9,6) there's my snake, and at (8,6) the board shows a '.' which means it's empty. So, it's safe to move left.\n\nI should also consider that moving left might bring me closer to the enemy snake if it moves, but since it's at (0,6), it's too far away to interfere in the next move.\n\nAnother thing: growing by eating apples helps me gain points, so I should prioritize moving towards the nearest apple each time to maximize points.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following moves, I can go up towards (8,9).\n</think>\n\nThe next move is LEFT to position (8,6), moving closer to the apple at (8,9).\n\n**DECIDED NEXT MOVE:** LEFT"

This is quite far.\n   - **(5,9):** Four steps left and three steps up. Also far.\n   - **(0,8):** Nine steps left and two steps up. Very far.\n   - **(7,1):** Two steps left and five steps down. Not the closest.\n\n   The closest apple is at (8,9).\n\n4. **Potential Path to (8,9):**\n   - Moving left from (9,6) to (8,6) is safe since there are no obstacles mentioned at (8,6).\n   - From (8,6), moving up three times will reach (8,9), where the apple is located.\n\n5. **Considering Walls and Obstacles:**\n   - Moving right from (9,6) is impossible as it goes beyond the board.\n   - Moving down could take me away from the apple at (8,9) without any benefits.\n   - Moving left is safe and brings me closer to the target apple.\n\n6. **Enemy Snake Position:**\n   - Snake #2 is at (0,7), which is far to the left and not in my immediate path towards (8,9). Therefore, it doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The best move is to go left to (8,6), as it directly leads me towards the nearest apple at (8,9).\n   - This move is safe and strategic for growth and points.\n\n**DECIDED NEXT MOVE:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I want to figure out my next move. Let me look at the information I have here. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (9,6). \n\nThere are some apples on the board at the following positions: (8,9), (3,4), (5,9), (0,8), and (7,1). My snake is at (9,6), and there's another enemy snake, ID 2, at (0,6) with an empty body. The board state shows where the apples and snakes are placed.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move next. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I have to be careful not to hit any walls, the other snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should plot the positions to get a better visual. My snake is at (9,6), which is the rightmost column (x=9) and row 6. Looking at the apples, the closest ones might be the best targets to go after. Let me list them:\n\n- (8,9): That's two units up and one to the left from my current position.\n- (3,4): That's far to the left and down, which might be too far.\n- (5,9): That's even further left but up.\n- (0,8): That's way to the left and up, which is probably too far.\n- (7,1): That's to the left and way down.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be at (8,9). It's one step to the left and two steps up from my current position. That might be a good target to move towards.\n\nBut wait, moving from (9,6) to (8,9) would require going left once and up twice. Alternatively, I can go up first and then left, but I need to be careful about the walls and any possible collisions.\n\nLet me think about the directions:\n\n- Moving UP from (9,6) would take me to (9,7). That's safe because there's no wall there; the top wall is at y=9.\n- Moving RIGHT would take me to (10,6), which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. I can't move right; it's blocked.\n- Moving DOWN would take me to (9,5). That's possible, but I don't see an apple there.\n- Moving LEFT would take me to (8,6). That's within the board, and (8,9) is an apple two steps up from there.\n\nSo, moving left to (8,6) seems like a good first step because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,9). From there, I can proceed upwards towards the apple.\n\nWait, but what about the other apples? The apple at (3,4) is quite far. I should focus on the nearest one because moving towards it would give me a point quickly and help me grow, which is better for future moves.\n\nAlso, I should check if there's any enemy snake nearby that might block me. Snake #2 is at (0,6), which is far away on the left side at the same y-coordinate. So, it's not in my immediate path towards (8,9). Therefore, I don't have to worry about it right now.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the wall. Moving right from (9,6) would make me go to (10,6), which is outside the board. So I must avoid moving right.\n\nSo, the plan is to move left to (8,6), then up to (8,7), and then up again to (8,8), and then up to (8,9) to get the apple. That's four moves, but I need to make sure each move is safe.\n\nWait, but my next move is just the first step. So, in this turn, I should move LEFT to (8,6). \n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any obstacle between (9,6) and (8,6)? According to the board state, at (9,6) there's my snake, and at (8,6) the board shows a '.' which means it's empty. So, it's safe to move left.\n\nI should also consider that moving left might bring me closer to the enemy snake if it moves, but since it's at (0,6), it's too far away to interfere in the next move.\n\nAnother thing: growing by eating apples helps me gain points, so I should prioritize moving towards the nearest apple each time to maximize points.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following moves, I can go up towards (8,9).\n</think>\n\nThe next move is LEFT to position (8,6), moving closer to the apple at (8,9).\n\n**DECIDED NEXT MOVE:** LEFT"

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the apples are located at (8,9), (3,4), (5,9), (7,1), and (5,5). I need to figure out which one is closest and whether moving towards it is feasible.\n\nStarting with the distances:\n\n1. Apple at (8,9): To get here, I need to move left from (9,6) to (8,6), and then up three times to (8,9). That's a total of four moves: LEFT once and then UP three times. It's pretty straightforward and seems close.\n\n2. Apple at (3,4): This is much farther. From (9,6), moving left six times to (3,6) and then down twice to (3,4). That's eight moves, which is quite a bit. Plus, moving that far left might risk running into the edge or other snakes.\n\n3. Apple at (5,9): To reach here, I'd have to move left four times to (5,6) and then up three times to (5,9). That's seven moves. While not as close as the first apple, it's still manageable but longer.\n\n4. Apple at (7,1): This would require moving left twice to (7,6) and then down five times to (7,1). That's seven moves as well. It's a bit of a journey and moving down five times might risk hitting the bottom wall or another snake.\n\n5. Apple at (5,5): Moving left four times to (5,6) and then down once to (5,5). That's five moves. Closer than the second and third options but still farther than the first apple.\n\nSo, the closest apple is clearly at (8,9). Now, checking the board for any obstacles:\n\n- My last position was (9,6). Moving LEFT to (8,6) is safe because there's no wall or enemy snake there. Enemy Snake #2 is at (0,7) with a body at (0,6), which is far away from my path.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (8,6) is the best next step. From there, I can continue moving UP towards (8,9) to grab the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger. Since the enemy snake is at (0,7), which is on the opposite side of the board, I don't have to worry about it blocking my path this time.\n\nSo, the plan is to move LEFT to (8,6) and then proceed to move UP towards (8,9) in the subsequent moves.\n</think>\n\nTo capture the apple at (8,9), I will continue moving left towards (8,6) next.\n\n**DECIDED NEXT MOVE:** LEFT"
