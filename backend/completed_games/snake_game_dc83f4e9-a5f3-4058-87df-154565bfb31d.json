My previous move was UP, resulting in no change, keeping me safe in the current position.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake\u2019s Threat**: The enemy Snake #2 is at (7, 8) with its body at (6, 8), (6, 7), and (6, 6). Moving closer to this snake risks encroaching on its path. Approaching that section poses a high likelihood of collision.\n\n3. **Apple Locations**:\n   - (1, 2)\n   - (2, 1)\n   - (0, 9)\n   - (5, 6) - currently too dangerous due to nearby enemy presence.\n   - (9, 1) - nearest apple in the opposite direction, providing a potential target for future turns.\n\n4. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **UP** to (8, 9): It is a valid empty spot above me, however, in terms of strategy, I would still be far from apples.\n   - **DOWN** to (8, 7): This would mean I am moving back, which is not advisable.\n   - **LEFT** to (7, 8): Not valid as there's the enemy snake.\n   - **RIGHT** to (9, 8): This moves me closer to the edge, but remains an open space.\n\n5. **Strategic Consideration**: Moving to (8, 9) seems to be safe as it\u2019s directly upward but offers no immediate benefits towards apples. Moving to (9, 8) also provides an option to explore the board without risking collision with enemy snakes. \n\nGiven that I need to maximize my chances of encountering apples without risking my position, I will choose to move RIGHT to (9, 8). From this position, I can evaluate my future moves towards apples while keeping a safe distance from enemy Snake #2.\n\nNext Move: RIGHT"

Although the enemy snake blocks direct access from the top (with pieces at (8,8), (8,7), and (8,6)), we can go down from (7,8) and then work our way right at a lower row.
