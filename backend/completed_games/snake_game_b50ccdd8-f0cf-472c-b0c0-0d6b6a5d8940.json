I don't want to run into it, so I'll try to stay away from its current position.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move up to (4, 8) and then assess the situation.

However, we should also be mindful of the enemy snake's position at (4, 9) and try to avoid it.\n\nFor now, let's focus on moving towards the apple at (3, 2). To do this, we need to move left and up. Since we can only move in one direction at a time, let's start by moving left.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (3, 2) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
