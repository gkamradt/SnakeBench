This allows me to gain a point quickly, grow my snake, and position myself advantageously for future movements.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving **RIGHT** to (4, 1) and collecting the apple, my immediate goal will be to navigate towards the apple at **(3, 5)**. I will aim to move **UP** in subsequent turns to approach it while ensuring that I maintain a safe distance from enemy snakes and avoid potential collisions.

To avoid this potential collision, I should move LEFT before reaching the apple. So, my strategy for the next turn is to move LEFT to (-2, 1), then DOWN to (0, 1), and finally LEFT to (-3, 1) to position myself closer to the apple at (1, 1) for the next turn.\n\nNext move: LEFT, LEFT, DOWN."

Moving here would result in a collision and death.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n   - **Safety:** This move is safe with no immediate obstacles.\n   - **Strategy:** Positions you closer to the apple at (5, 7) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\n3. **UP to (2, 6):**\n   - **Safety:** This move is safe.\n   - **Strategy:** Moves you towards higher y-coordinates, but doesn't directly align with any nearby apples.\n\n4. **DOWN to (2, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** This move is safe.\n   - **Strategy:** Moves you away from current apple locations and doesn't provide a clear path to any apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (3, 5) is the most strategic choice.
