Moving RIGHT to (2,4) means we grab that apple immediately and grow in length. There are no enemy bodies or walls in that direction, and it\u2019s a guaranteed boost to our score.\n\nLooking ahead, choosing RIGHT also keeps us in a safe zone, as the enemy snake is still far away in the upper regions of the board with its head at (0,9). After taking the apple, we can reassess and plan towards other apples like the one at (3,5) or (0,6) in subsequent moves.\n\nThus, our next move is: RIGHT."
