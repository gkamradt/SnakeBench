However, it does not bring me closer to the apples but keeps me in a low-risk zone.\n- **Move LEFT (3, 8)**: This position is empty and safe as well. It's another possibility, but also doesn't provide a direct path to any apples.\n- **Move RIGHT (5, 8)**: This would land on the enemy snake, which would result in my death.\n\nConsidering these moves, moving down to (4, 7) keeps me safe while allowing me the flexibility to maneuver towards a better position for the next turn. I need to prioritize staying away from enemies while positioning myself towards reachable apples.\n\nFor my next strategy, I'll evaluate my options to approach (7, 7) next without running into traps or other snakes.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my decided next move is: DOWN."
