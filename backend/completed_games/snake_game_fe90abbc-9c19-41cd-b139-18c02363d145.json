Moving down would take the snake away from the nearest apple, so it's not the best move. Moving left or right would keep the snake in a position to eventually reach the apple at (4, 6).\n\nSince the snake is currently at (8, 6), moving left would bring it closer to the apple at (4, 6) and avoid the enemy snake. Moving right would also avoid the enemy snake but would not bring the snake closer to the nearest apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving left until the snake is in line with the apple at (4, 6), then move up to reach the apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
