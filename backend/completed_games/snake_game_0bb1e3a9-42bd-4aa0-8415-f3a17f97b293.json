Going up or down will result in a collision with the boundary of the board, which I definitely don't want.\n\nSo, going right seems the best option right now, even though it initially appears to take me farther from the nearest apple. But if I go right, it would keep every option open to change direction to any side in the next move.\n\nHowever, an important note is, going right will put me at the edge of the board. So the next turn, I will need to either move Down or Left to avoid colliding with the board edge.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

However, going for that apple might not be the best move right now because it's close to the enemy snake at (9, 8). If I go for that apple, I risk the enemy snake cutting me off or trapping me.\n\nThe apple at (1, 7) is also relatively close, and it's a safer option since the enemy snake is far away from it. By going for this apple, I can grow my snake and increase my points without putting myself in immediate danger.\n\nAfter getting the apple at (1, 7), I should focus on the apples at (0, 8) and (6, 1), as they are far from the enemy snake and will allow me to grow further.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (1, 7), prioritize the apples at (0, 8) and (6, 1) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adjust my path accordingly to avoid being trapped or cut off.\n\nMy next move: LEFT."
