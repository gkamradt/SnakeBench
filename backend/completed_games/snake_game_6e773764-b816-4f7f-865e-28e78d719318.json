Looking over the board, the closest apple appears to be at (9,4) because it\u2019s only 3 moves away (for example, from (8,2) I can move RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3), and finally UP to (9,4) where the apple is located). Other apples are much farther away (for instance, (0,2) requires 8 moves, (1,0) 9 moves, etc.).\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve checked that moving RIGHT from (8,2) isn\u2019t immediately dangerous. The square (9,2) is free according to the board, and while being on the board\u2019s edge, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m colliding with a wall. From (9,2) I can proceed upward toward (9,4) without hitting obstacles.\n\nGiven that my snake needs a safe and reasonably quick way to an apple and considering the obstacle layout (e.g. the cell above (8,2) is blocked by a T at (8,3)), the best next move is to start heading toward (9,4) by moving RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

By moving RIGHT, we steer our snake toward the open area where we can later maneuver downward and rightward, which looks promising for accessing the apples at (8,1) and (7,0). It also avoids the narrow passage and the dense obstacles on row6.\n\nGiven these options, moving RIGHT maximizes our future mobility and keeps us in a more open area of the board with better prospects for reaching our apple targets.\n\nTherefore, I decide that our next move is: RIGHT."

From (4,2) we can gradually approach those apples while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nConsidering both safety and progress toward the more lucrative apple cluster, my next move is: UP."

However, while moving down might seem to head toward apple (0,7) on row7, our board shows a blocking obstacle at (4,8) already to our left (and more T\u2019s nearby), which would make any leftward maneuver risky. Plus, heading directly down from (5,8) risks getting trapped due to the contiguous line of obstacles along row6 (columns 2\u20137), which would make future navigation difficult.\n\n\u2022 LEFT to (4,8) is not an option since (4,8) is occupied by an obstacle.\n\n\u2022 RIGHT to (6,8): This square is free and lies in an open section of row8 (columns 5 through 9 are clear). By moving RIGHT, we steer our snake toward the open area where we can later maneuver downward and rightward, which looks promising for accessing the apples at (8,1) and (7,0). It also avoids the narrow passage and the dense obstacles on row6.\n\nGiven these options, moving RIGHT maximizes our future mobility and keeps us in a more open area of the board with better prospects for reaching our apple targets.\n\nTherefore, I decide that our next move is: RIGHT."

It\u2019s just one move down and one move to the right from our current head if we position ourselves correctly.\n\u2003\u2013 The other apples are farther away.\n\n\u2022 From (2,9) our safe moves are LEFT or RIGHT.
