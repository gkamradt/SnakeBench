            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,8). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (9,5), (6,2), and (1,4). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm up near the top at (5,8). Let me sketch a small mental map:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 4: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nWhere 2 is me, 1 is the enemy snake, A's are apples, and '.' are empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity, danger, and potential paths.\n\nLet's list the apples and their distances from my current position:\n\n1. (2,0): That's quite far. Horizontal distance: |5-2|=3, vertical distance: |8-0|=8. So, about 11 moves away, assuming a straight path.\n\n2. (4,6): Horizontal: |5-4|=1, vertical: |8-6|=2. About 3 moves away.\n\n3. (9,5): Horizontal: |5-9|=4, vertical: |8-5|=3. About 7 moves away.\n\n4. (6,2): Horizontal: |5-6|=1, vertical: |8-2|=6. About 7 moves away.\n\n5. (1,4): Horizontal: |5-1|=4, vertical: |8-4|=4. About 8 moves away.\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,6) and (6,2), both around 7 moves away, but (4,6) is actually closer at 3 moves. However, I need to consider if there are any obstacles or risks in those paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider (4,6). It's close, only 3 moves away. Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (5,8):\n\n- Down to (5,7)\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\nSeems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in this path. Let's check if the enemy snake could interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), and its body is empty, so it's just the head at (9,4). If I move towards (4,6), the enemy is down at (9,4), so it's not in my way immediately. However, I need to consider if the enemy could move towards me in the next few turns.\n\nBut for now, the path seems clear. After eating the apple at (4,6), I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position would be (4,6), and my tail would have extended. Since I grew, my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next. Let's see the next closest apple after (4,6).\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,0): Still far.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |4-9|=5, vertical: |6-5|=1. About 6 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |4-6|=2, vertical: |6-2|=4. About 6 moves.\n\n- (1,4): Horizontal: |4-1|=3, vertical: |6-4|=2. About 5 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is now the closest at about 5 moves.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,6) to (1,4):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Down to (2,5)\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 moves, which matches my earlier estimate.\n\nI need to ensure that this path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,4), which is quite far horizontally, and assuming it moves towards me, it would take several moves to reach me. Meanwhile, I can reach (1,4) in 5 moves, so hopefully, I can get there before the enemy poses a threat.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that my own tail doesn't block my path. Since I'm growing, my tail will be extending, so I need to keep track of its positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (6,2) instead of (1,4) after (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves to (6,2), which is similar to going to (1,4).\n\nBut perhaps (6,2) is a better choice because it's further from the enemy's current position at (9,4).\n\nWait, but (6,2) is closer to the enemy than (1,4) is. The enemy is at (9,4), which is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (6,2):\n\nHorizontal: |9-6|=3, vertical: |4-2|=2. Total: 5 moves.\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (1,4):\n\nHorizontal: |9-1|=8, vertical: |4-4|=0. Total: 8 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4). Therefore, going to (1,4) might be safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,4), the next closest apple would be (2,0), which is still far, or (9,5), which is closer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (1,4), the remaining apples are:\n\n- (2,0): Horizontal: |1-2|=1, vertical: |4-0|=4. About 5 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |1-9|=8, vertical: |4-5|=1. About 9 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |1-6|=5, vertical: |4-2|=2. About 7 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Already considered.\n\nSo, (2,0) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nPath from (1,4) to (2,0):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,0), I would grow again, and then I can aim for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (9,5) after (4,6), even though it's farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (9,5):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\n- Right to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nBut the enemy is at (9,4), which is adjacent to (9,5). So, if I go to (9,5), the enemy might be able to reach me faster.\n\nPerhaps it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,2) after (4,6), even though the enemy is closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (6,2):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4), which is horizontally distant, so it would take some moves to reach me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,5) first, then (6,2), then (2,0),"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nThere are apples located at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). Also, there's an enemy snake at (9,5), with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top. Columns are from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (5,7), which is column 5, row 7.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,0): column 2, row 0\n\n- (4,6): column 4, row 6\n\n- (6,2): column 6, row 2\n\n- (1,4): column 1, row 4\n\n- (0,6): column 0, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,5), column 9, row 5, with its body at (9,4).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider which one is closest and safest to reach without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the distances from my current position (5,7) to each apple.\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-2| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-0| = 7\n\n- Total estimated moves: 3 + 7 = 10\n\n2. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-4| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-6| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-2| = 5\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-1| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-4| = 3\n\n- Total estimated moves: 4 + 3 = 7\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-0| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just 2 moves away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or my own tail.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (9,5), which is quite far from my current position and the apple at (4,6). So, it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the path to the apple.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Move down to (5,6)\n\n- Move left to (4,6)\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position is (4,6), and my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (4,6) to the remaining apples:\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-2| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-0| = 6\n\n- Total: 8 moves\n\n2. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-6| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-2| = 4\n\n- Total: 6 moves\n\n3. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Vertical: |6-4| = 2\n\n- Total: 5 moves\n\n4. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-0| = 4\n\n- Vertical: |6-6| = 0\n\n- Total: 4 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple from (4,6) is at (0,6), which is 4 moves away.\n\nLet me plan the path to (0,6):\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Left to (1,6)\n\n- Left to (0,6)\n\nThat's 4 moves to the left.\n\nI need to ensure that there are no obstacles in this path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), which is far away, and assuming no other snakes are in the way, this path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,6), I will grow again, so my tail will extend further.\n\nThen, I can aim for the next closest apple.\n\nLet's see from (0,6):\n\n- Apple at (1,4): 2 moves down and 1 to the right\n\n- Apple at (2,0): 6 moves down and 2 to the right\n\n- Apple at (4,6): already eaten\n\n- Apple at (6,2): 6 moves to the right and 4 down\n\nSo, the closest would be (1,4), which is 2 moves down and 1 to the right.\n\nFrom (0,6):\n\n- Down to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nThen, after eating (1,4), I can aim for (2,0), which is a bit farther, or (6,2).\n\nBut I think it's better to go for (2,0) next, as it's closer.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for (6,2) next, but that's farther.\n\nSo, sticking with (2,0) after (1,4) makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the enemy snake.\n\nIts head is at (9,5), and its body is at (9,4). So, it's likely to move up or down.\n\nI need to make sure that its path doesn't intersect with mine as I go for the apples.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), and I'm at (5,7), moving to (4,6) and then to (0,6), it seems like the enemy is on the opposite side of the board.\n\nAs long as I keep moving left and down, away from the enemy, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements in subsequent turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the apple at (4,6) seems like the best immediate action.\n\nSo, to reach (4,6) from (5,7), I need to move down to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the last move information, it seems that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nWait, no, according to the last move information:\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, it seems like there's some confusion here. Let me read the last move information again.\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,7). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\n...\n\nSo, in the last move, I decided to move down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nNow, considering that, and assuming that move has already been executed, my current position should be (5,6).\n\nBut in the board state provided, it shows me at (5,7), which might be a confusion.\n\nWait, in the board state:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . .

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,8). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (9,5), (6,2), and (1,4). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm up near the top at (5,8). Let me sketch a small mental map:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . .

A . . . . . . .\n\nWhere 2 is me, 1 is the enemy snake, A's are apples, and '.' are empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity, danger, and potential paths.\n\nLet's list the apples and their distances from my current position:\n\n1. (2,0): That's quite far. Horizontal distance: |5-2|=3, vertical distance: |8-0|=8. So, about 11 moves away, assuming a straight path.\n\n2. (4,6): Horizontal: |5-4|=1, vertical: |8-6|=2. About 3 moves away.\n\n3. (9,5): Horizontal: |5-9|=4, vertical: |8-5|=3. About 7 moves away.\n\n4. (6,2): Horizontal: |5-6|=1, vertical: |8-2|=6. About 7 moves away.\n\n5. (1,4): Horizontal: |5-1|=4, vertical: |8-4|=4. About 8 moves away.\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,6) and (6,2), both around 7 moves away, but (4,6) is actually closer at 3 moves. However, I need to consider if there are any obstacles or risks in those paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider (4,6). It's close, only 3 moves away. Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (5,8):\n\n- Down to (5,7)\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\nSeems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in this path. Let's check if the enemy snake could interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), and its body is empty, so it's just the head at (9,4). If I move towards (4,6), the enemy is down at (9,4), so it's not in my way immediately. However, I need to consider if the enemy could move towards me in the next few turns.\n\nBut for now, the path seems clear. After eating the apple at (4,6), I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position would be (4,6), and my tail would have extended. Since I grew, my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next. Let's see the next closest apple after (4,6).\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,0): Still far.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |4-9|=5, vertical: |6-5|=1. About 6 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |4-6|=2, vertical: |6-2|=4. About 6 moves.\n\n- (1,4): Horizontal: |4-1|=3, vertical: |6-4|=2. About 5 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is now the closest at about 5 moves.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,6) to (1,4):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Down to (2,5)\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 moves, which matches my earlier estimate.\n\nI need to ensure that this path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,4), which is quite far horizontally, and assuming it moves towards me, it would take several moves to reach me. Meanwhile, I can reach (1,4) in 5 moves, so hopefully, I can get there before the enemy poses a threat.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that my own tail doesn't block my path. Since I'm growing, my tail will be extending, so I need to keep track of its positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (6,2) instead of (1,4) after (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves to (6,2), which is similar to going to (1,4).\n\nBut perhaps (6,2) is a better choice because it's further from the enemy's current position at (9,4).\n\nWait, but (6,2) is closer to the enemy than (1,4) is. The enemy is at (9,4), which is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (6,2):\n\nHorizontal: |9-6|=3, vertical: |4-2|=2. Total: 5 moves.\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (1,4):\n\nHorizontal: |9-1|=8, vertical: |4-4|=0. Total: 8 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4). Therefore, going to (1,4) might be safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,4), the next closest apple would be (2,0), which is still far, or (9,5), which is closer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (1,4), the remaining apples are:\n\n- (2,0): Horizontal: |1-2|=1, vertical: |4-0|=4. About 5 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |1-9|=8, vertical: |4-5|=1. About 9 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |1-6|=5, vertical: |4-2|=2. About 7 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Already considered.\n\nSo, (2,0) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nPath from (1,4) to (2,0):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,0), I would grow again, and then I can aim for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (9,5) after (4,6), even though it's farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (9,5):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\n- Right to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nBut the enemy is at (9,4), which is adjacent to (9,5). So, if I go to (9,5), the enemy might be able to reach me faster.\n\nPerhaps it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,2) after (4,6), even though the enemy is closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (6,2):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4), which is horizontally distant, so it would take some moves to reach me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,5) first, then (6,2), then (2,0),"

So, it's likely to move up or down.\n\nI need to make sure that its path doesn't intersect with mine as I go for the apples.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), and I'm at (5,7), moving to (4,6) and then to (0,6), it seems like the enemy is on the opposite side of the board.\n\nAs long as I keep moving left and down, away from the enemy, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements in subsequent turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the apple at (4,6) seems like the best immediate action.\n\nSo, to reach (4,6) from (5,7), I need to move down to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the last move information, it seems that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nWait, no, according to the last move information:\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, it seems like there's some confusion here. Let me read the last move information again.\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,7). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\n...\n\nSo, in the last move, I decided to move down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nNow, considering that, and assuming that move has already been executed, my current position should be (5,6).\n\nBut in the board state provided, it shows me at (5,7), which might be a confusion.\n\nWait, in the board state:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . .

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move next in this snake game. Let's recap the current situation.\n\nMy snake, number 2, is currently at position (5,6) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). There's an enemy snake at (9,5) with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (4,6), which is just one step to the left from my current position at (5,6). After eating that apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move left from (5,6) to (4,6) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. After eating the apple, I need to decide where to go next. The next closest apple would be at (0,6), which is directly to the left.\n\n3. From (4,6), I can move left to (3,6), then to (2,6), then to (1,6), and finally to (0,6).\n\n4. After eating the apple at (0,6), I should look for the next apple. The one at (1,4) seems accessible by moving down to (0,5), then (0,4), then right to (1,4).\n\n5. Finally, I can aim for the apple at (2,0), moving down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and then right to (2,0).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path. The enemy is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path immediately. However, I need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I don't run into my own tail as I grow longer. After eating the first apple at (4,6), my tail will extend, so I have to plan my moves to avoid it.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves in more detail:\n\n- Move left from (5,6) to (4,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (4,6).\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will remain at (5,6).\n\n- Move left from (4,6) to (3,6):\n\n  - No apple here, just moving.\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will be at (4,6).\n\n- Move left from (3,6) to (2,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (3,6).\n\n- Move left from (2,6) to (1,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (2,6).\n\n- Move left from (1,6) to (0,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (0,6).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,6) to (0,5):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,5) to (0,4):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,5).\n\n- Move right from (0,4) to (1,4):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (1,4).\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,4) to (1,3):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,3) to (1,2):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,3).\n\n- Move down from (1,2) to (1,1):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,2).\n\n- Move down from (1,1) to (1,0):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,1).\n\n- Move right from (1,0) to (2,0):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (2,0).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,0).\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan, assuming no obstacles or enemy interference.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a more efficient path or if I might be cutting off my own escape route.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving all the way to the left side of the board might put me closer to the enemy snake, which is currently at (9,5). If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape plan.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (4,6), I could consider going for the apple at (6,2), which is also relatively close.\n\nLet me compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1: (4,6) -> (0,6) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 1 (to 4,6) + 4 (to 0,6) + 3 (to 1,4) + 5 (to 2,0) = 13 moves\n\nPath 2: (4,6) -> (6,2) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 moves to (6,2)\n\nThen, from (6,2):\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (2,4)\n\n- Up to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\n- Left to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9 moves to (1,4)\n\nThen, from (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 4 + 1 = 5 moves to (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 9 + 5 = 19 moves\n\nComparing to Path 1, which is 13 moves, Path 1 is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, I should stick with Path 1.\n\nNow, considering that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6), and now I'm at (5,6), my next move should be to the left to (4,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut wait, in the board state, it shows me at (5,6), but according to the last move, I moved down to (5,6). So, assuming that move has been executed, my current position is (5,6).\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the left to (4,6).\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . T\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nFrom (5,6), moving left to (4,6), which has an apple.\n\nNo obstacles in the way.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so (5,6) will still be occupied by my tail.\n\nThen, moving left to (3,6), then (2,6), then (1,6), then (0,6), eating the apple there.\n\nFrom (0,6), moving down to (0,5), then (0,4), then right to (1,4), eating the apple.\n\nThen, moving down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), then right to (2,0), eating the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), and assuming it moves up or down, it's unlikely to interfere with my path to (0,6).\n\nHowever, I need to monitor its movement in future turns.\n\nFor now, my immediate move should be to the left to (4,6).\n\nBut wait, I need to consider if moving left to (4,6) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nAt (4,6), there's an apple, which I need to eat.\n\nAfter eating it, my tail will extend, so (5,6) will still be occupied by my tail.\n\nThen, moving left to (3,6):\n\n- (4,6) to (3,6)\n\n- (3,6) to (2,6)\n\n- (2,6) to (1,6)\n\n- ("

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,8). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (9,5), (6,2), and (1,4). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm up near the top at (5,8). Let me sketch a small mental map:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 4: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nWhere 2 is me, 1 is the enemy snake, A's are apples, and '.' are empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity, danger, and potential paths.\n\nLet's list the apples and their distances from my current position:\n\n1. (2,0): That's quite far. Horizontal distance: |5-2|=3, vertical distance: |8-0|=8. So, about 11 moves away, assuming a straight path.\n\n2. (4,6): Horizontal: |5-4|=1, vertical: |8-6|=2. About 3 moves away.\n\n3. (9,5): Horizontal: |5-9|=4, vertical: |8-5|=3. About 7 moves away.\n\n4. (6,2): Horizontal: |5-6|=1, vertical: |8-2|=6. About 7 moves away.\n\n5. (1,4): Horizontal: |5-1|=4, vertical: |8-4|=4. About 8 moves away.\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,6) and (6,2), both around 7 moves away, but (4,6) is actually closer at 3 moves. However, I need to consider if there are any obstacles or risks in those paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider (4,6). It's close, only 3 moves away. Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (5,8):\n\n- Down to (5,7)\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\nSeems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in this path. Let's check if the enemy snake could interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), and its body is empty, so it's just the head at (9,4). If I move towards (4,6), the enemy is down at (9,4), so it's not in my way immediately. However, I need to consider if the enemy could move towards me in the next few turns.\n\nBut for now, the path seems clear. After eating the apple at (4,6), I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position would be (4,6), and my tail would have extended. Since I grew, my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next. Let's see the next closest apple after (4,6).\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,0): Still far.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |4-9|=5, vertical: |6-5|=1. About 6 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |4-6|=2, vertical: |6-2|=4. About 6 moves.\n\n- (1,4): Horizontal: |4-1|=3, vertical: |6-4|=2. About 5 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is now the closest at about 5 moves.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,6) to (1,4):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Down to (2,5)\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 moves, which matches my earlier estimate.\n\nI need to ensure that this path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,4), which is quite far horizontally, and assuming it moves towards me, it would take several moves to reach me. Meanwhile, I can reach (1,4) in 5 moves, so hopefully, I can get there before the enemy poses a threat.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that my own tail doesn't block my path. Since I'm growing, my tail will be extending, so I need to keep track of its positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (6,2) instead of (1,4) after (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves to (6,2), which is similar to going to (1,4).\n\nBut perhaps (6,2) is a better choice because it's further from the enemy's current position at (9,4).\n\nWait, but (6,2) is closer to the enemy than (1,4) is. The enemy is at (9,4), which is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (6,2):\n\nHorizontal: |9-6|=3, vertical: |4-2|=2. Total: 5 moves.\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (1,4):\n\nHorizontal: |9-1|=8, vertical: |4-4|=0. Total: 8 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4). Therefore, going to (1,4) might be safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,4), the next closest apple would be (2,0), which is still far, or (9,5), which is closer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (1,4), the remaining apples are:\n\n- (2,0): Horizontal: |1-2|=1, vertical: |4-0|=4. About 5 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |1-9|=8, vertical: |4-5|=1. About 9 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |1-6|=5, vertical: |4-2|=2. About 7 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Already considered.\n\nSo, (2,0) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nPath from (1,4) to (2,0):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,0), I would grow again, and then I can aim for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (9,5) after (4,6), even though it's farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (9,5):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\n- Right to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nBut the enemy is at (9,4), which is adjacent to (9,5). So, if I go to (9,5), the enemy might be able to reach me faster.\n\nPerhaps it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,2) after (4,6), even though the enemy is closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (6,2):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4), which is horizontally distant, so it would take some moves to reach me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,5) first, then (6,2), then (2,0),"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nThere are apples located at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). Also, there's an enemy snake at (9,5), with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top. Columns are from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (5,7), which is column 5, row 7.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,0): column 2, row 0\n\n- (4,6): column 4, row 6\n\n- (6,2): column 6, row 2\n\n- (1,4): column 1, row 4\n\n- (0,6): column 0, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,5), column 9, row 5, with its body at (9,4).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider which one is closest and safest to reach without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the distances from my current position (5,7) to each apple.\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-2| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-0| = 7\n\n- Total estimated moves: 3 + 7 = 10\n\n2. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-4| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-6| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-2| = 5\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-1| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-4| = 3\n\n- Total estimated moves: 4 + 3 = 7\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-0| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just 2 moves away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or my own tail.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (9,5), which is quite far from my current position and the apple at (4,6). So, it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the path to the apple.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Move down to (5,6)\n\n- Move left to (4,6)\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position is (4,6), and my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (4,6) to the remaining apples:\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-2| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-0| = 6\n\n- Total: 8 moves\n\n2. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-6| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-2| = 4\n\n- Total: 6 moves\n\n3. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Vertical: |6-4| = 2\n\n- Total: 5 moves\n\n4. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-0| = 4\n\n- Vertical: |6-6| = 0\n\n- Total: 4 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple from (4,6) is at (0,6), which is 4 moves away.\n\nLet me plan the path to (0,6):\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Left to (1,6)\n\n- Left to (0,6)\n\nThat's 4 moves to the left.\n\nI need to ensure that there are no obstacles in this path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), which is far away, and assuming no other snakes are in the way, this path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,6), I will grow again, so my tail will extend further.\n\nThen, I can aim for the next closest apple.\n\nLet's see from (0,6):\n\n- Apple at (1,4): 2 moves down and 1 to the right\n\n- Apple at (2,0): 6 moves down and 2 to the right\n\n- Apple at (4,6): already eaten\n\n- Apple at (6,2): 6 moves to the right and 4 down\n\nSo, the closest would be (1,4), which is 2 moves down and 1 to the right.\n\nFrom (0,6):\n\n- Down to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nThen, after eating (1,4), I can aim for (2,0), which is a bit farther, or (6,2).\n\nBut I think it's better to go for (2,0) next, as it's closer.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for (6,2) next, but that's farther.\n\nSo, sticking with (2,0) after (1,4) makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the enemy snake.\n\nIts head is at (9,5), and its body is at (9,4). So, it's likely to move up or down.\n\nI need to make sure that its path doesn't intersect with mine as I go for the apples.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), and I'm at (5,7), moving to (4,6) and then to (0,6), it seems like the enemy is on the opposite side of the board.\n\nAs long as I keep moving left and down, away from the enemy, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements in subsequent turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the apple at (4,6) seems like the best immediate action.\n\nSo, to reach (4,6) from (5,7), I need to move down to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the last move information, it seems that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nWait, no, according to the last move information:\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, it seems like there's some confusion here. Let me read the last move information again.\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,7). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\n...\n\nSo, in the last move, I decided to move down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nNow, considering that, and assuming that move has already been executed, my current position should be (5,6).\n\nBut in the board state provided, it shows me at (5,7), which might be a confusion.\n\nWait, in the board state:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . .

Moving left would put me in direct conflict with the enemy snake, which could result in a game over if we collide. The apple at (6,2) is also a good target, but moving towards it would require me to go down first, which would put me at risk of the enemy snake moving up. The apple at (0,6) is to my left and up, but moving towards it would require me to go around the enemy snake, which could be risky. The apple at (1,4) is to my left and down, but moving towards it would require me to go around the enemy snake, which could be risky.

Let's recap the current situation.\n\nMy snake, number 2, is currently at position (5,6) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). There's an enemy snake at (9,5) with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (4,6), which is just one step to the left from my current position at (5,6). After eating that apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move left from (5,6) to (4,6) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. After eating the apple, I need to decide where to go next. The next closest apple would be at (0,6), which is directly to the left.\n\n3. From (4,6), I can move left to (3,6), then to (2,6), then to (1,6), and finally to (0,6).\n\n4. After eating the apple at (0,6), I should look for the next apple. The one at (1,4) seems accessible by moving down to (0,5), then (0,4), then right to (1,4).\n\n5. Finally, I can aim for the apple at (2,0), moving down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and then right to (2,0).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path. The enemy is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path immediately. However, I need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I don't run into my own tail as I grow longer. After eating the first apple at (4,6), my tail will extend, so I have to plan my moves to avoid it.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves in more detail:\n\n- Move left from (5,6) to (4,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (4,6).\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will remain at (5,6).\n\n- Move left from (4,6) to (3,6):\n\n  - No apple here, just moving.\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will be at (4,6).\n\n- Move left from (3,6) to (2,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (3,6).\n\n- Move left from (2,6) to (1,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (2,6).\n\n- Move left from (1,6) to (0,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (0,6).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,6) to (0,5):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,5) to (0,4):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,5).\n\n- Move right from (0,4) to (1,4):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (1,4).\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,4) to (1,3):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,3) to (1,2):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,3).\n\n- Move down from (1,2) to (1,1):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,2).\n\n- Move down from (1,1) to (1,0):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,1).\n\n- Move right from (1,0) to (2,0):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (2,0).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,0).\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan, assuming no obstacles or enemy interference.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a more efficient path or if I might be cutting off my own escape route.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving all the way to the left side of the board might put me closer to the enemy snake, which is currently at (9,5). If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape plan.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (4,6), I could consider going for the apple at (6,2), which is also relatively close.\n\nLet me compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1: (4,6) -> (0,6) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 1 (to 4,6) + 4 (to 0,6) + 3 (to 1,4) + 5 (to 2,0) = 13 moves\n\nPath 2: (4,6) -> (6,2) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 moves to (6,2)\n\nThen, from (6,2):\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (2,4)\n\n- Up to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\n- Left to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9 moves to (1,4)\n\nThen, from (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 4 + 1 = 5 moves to (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 9 + 5 = 19 moves\n\nComparing to Path 1, which is 13 moves, Path 1 is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, I should stick with Path 1.\n\nNow, considering that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6), and now I'm at (5,6), my next move should be to the left to (4,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut wait, in the board state, it shows me at (5,6), but according to the last move, I moved down to (5,6). So, assuming that move has been executed, my current position is (5,6).\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the left to (4,6).\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . .

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,8). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (9,5), (6,2), and (1,4). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm up near the top at (5,8). Let me sketch a small mental map:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 4: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nWhere 2 is me, 1 is the enemy snake, A's are apples, and '.' are empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity, danger, and potential paths.\n\nLet's list the apples and their distances from my current position:\n\n1. (2,0): That's quite far. Horizontal distance: |5-2|=3, vertical distance: |8-0|=8. So, about 11 moves away, assuming a straight path.\n\n2. (4,6): Horizontal: |5-4|=1, vertical: |8-6|=2. About 3 moves away.\n\n3. (9,5): Horizontal: |5-9|=4, vertical: |8-5|=3. About 7 moves away.\n\n4. (6,2): Horizontal: |5-6|=1, vertical: |8-2|=6. About 7 moves away.\n\n5. (1,4): Horizontal: |5-1|=4, vertical: |8-4|=4. About 8 moves away.\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,6) and (6,2), both around 7 moves away, but (4,6) is actually closer at 3 moves. However, I need to consider if there are any obstacles or risks in those paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider (4,6). It's close, only 3 moves away. Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (5,8):\n\n- Down to (5,7)\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\nSeems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in this path. Let's check if the enemy snake could interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), and its body is empty, so it's just the head at (9,4). If I move towards (4,6), the enemy is down at (9,4), so it's not in my way immediately. However, I need to consider if the enemy could move towards me in the next few turns.\n\nBut for now, the path seems clear. After eating the apple at (4,6), I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position would be (4,6), and my tail would have extended. Since I grew, my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next. Let's see the next closest apple after (4,6).\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,0): Still far.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |4-9|=5, vertical: |6-5|=1. About 6 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |4-6|=2, vertical: |6-2|=4. About 6 moves.\n\n- (1,4): Horizontal: |4-1|=3, vertical: |6-4|=2. About 5 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is now the closest at about 5 moves.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,6) to (1,4):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Down to (2,5)\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 moves, which matches my earlier estimate.\n\nI need to ensure that this path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,4), which is quite far horizontally, and assuming it moves towards me, it would take several moves to reach me. Meanwhile, I can reach (1,4) in 5 moves, so hopefully, I can get there before the enemy poses a threat.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that my own tail doesn't block my path. Since I'm growing, my tail will be extending, so I need to keep track of its positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (6,2) instead of (1,4) after (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves to (6,2), which is similar to going to (1,4).\n\nBut perhaps (6,2) is a better choice because it's further from the enemy's current position at (9,4).\n\nWait, but (6,2) is closer to the enemy than (1,4) is. The enemy is at (9,4), which is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (6,2):\n\nHorizontal: |9-6|=3, vertical: |4-2|=2. Total: 5 moves.\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (1,4):\n\nHorizontal: |9-1|=8, vertical: |4-4|=0. Total: 8 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4). Therefore, going to (1,4) might be safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,4), the next closest apple would be (2,0), which is still far, or (9,5), which is closer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (1,4), the remaining apples are:\n\n- (2,0): Horizontal: |1-2|=1, vertical: |4-0|=4. About 5 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |1-9|=8, vertical: |4-5|=1. About 9 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |1-6|=5, vertical: |4-2|=2. About 7 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Already considered.\n\nSo, (2,0) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nPath from (1,4) to (2,0):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,0), I would grow again, and then I can aim for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (9,5) after (4,6), even though it's farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (9,5):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\n- Right to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nBut the enemy is at (9,4), which is adjacent to (9,5). So, if I go to (9,5), the enemy might be able to reach me faster.\n\nPerhaps it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,2) after (4,6), even though the enemy is closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (6,2):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4), which is horizontally distant, so it would take some moves to reach me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,5) first, then (6,2), then (2,0),"

So, let's see the current situation.\n\nI'm controlling snake number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,7). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nThere are apples located at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). Also, there's an enemy snake at (9,5), with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top. Columns are from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (5,7), which is column 5, row 7.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,0): column 2, row 0\n\n- (4,6): column 4, row 6\n\n- (6,2): column 6, row 2\n\n- (1,4): column 1, row 4\n\n- (0,6): column 0, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,5), column 9, row 5, with its body at (9,4).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider which one is closest and safest to reach without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the distances from my current position (5,7) to each apple.\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-2| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-0| = 7\n\n- Total estimated moves: 3 + 7 = 10\n\n2. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-4| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-6| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-2| = 5\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-1| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-4| = 3\n\n- Total estimated moves: 4 + 3 = 7\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-0| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just 2 moves away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or my own tail.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (9,5), which is quite far from my current position and the apple at (4,6). So, it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the path to the apple.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Move down to (5,6)\n\n- Move left to (4,6)\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position is (4,6), and my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (4,6) to the remaining apples:\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-2| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-0| = 6\n\n- Total: 8 moves\n\n2. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-6| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-2| = 4\n\n- Total: 6 moves\n\n3. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Vertical: |6-4| = 2\n\n- Total: 5 moves\n\n4. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-0| = 4\n\n- Vertical: |6-6| = 0\n\n- Total: 4 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple from (4,6) is at (0,6), which is 4 moves away.\n\nLet me plan the path to (0,6):\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Left to (1,6)\n\n- Left to (0,6)\n\nThat's 4 moves to the left.\n\nI need to ensure that there are no obstacles in this path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), which is far away, and assuming no other snakes are in the way, this path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,6), I will grow again, so my tail will extend further.\n\nThen, I can aim for the next closest apple.\n\nLet's see from (0,6):\n\n- Apple at (1,4): 2 moves down and 1 to the right\n\n- Apple at (2,0): 6 moves down and 2 to the right\n\n- Apple at (4,6): already eaten\n\n- Apple at (6,2): 6 moves to the right and 4 down\n\nSo, the closest would be (1,4), which is 2 moves down and 1 to the right.\n\nFrom (0,6):\n\n- Down to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nThen, after eating (1,4), I can aim for (2,0), which is a bit farther, or (6,2).\n\nBut I think it's better to go for (2,0) next, as it's closer.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for (6,2) next, but that's farther.\n\nSo, sticking with (2,0) after (1,4) makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the enemy snake.\n\nIts head is at (9,5), and its body is at (9,4). So, it's likely to move up or down.\n\nI need to make sure that its path doesn't intersect with mine as I go for the apples.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), and I'm at (5,7), moving to (4,6) and then to (0,6), it seems like the enemy is on the opposite side of the board.\n\nAs long as I keep moving left and down, away from the enemy, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements in subsequent turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the apple at (4,6) seems like the best immediate action.\n\nSo, to reach (4,6) from (5,7), I need to move down to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the last move information, it seems that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nWait, no, according to the last move information:\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, it seems like there's some confusion here. Let me read the last move information again.\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,8). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (9,5), (6,2), and (1,4). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm up near the top at (5,8). Let me sketch a small mental map:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 4: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nWhere 2 is me, 1 is the enemy snake, A's are apples, and '.' are empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity, danger, and potential paths.\n\nLet's list the apples and their distances from my current position:\n\n1. (2,0): That's quite far. Horizontal distance: |5-2|=3, vertical distance: |8-0|=8. So, about 11 moves away, assuming a straight path.\n\n2. (4,6): Horizontal: |5-4|=1, vertical: |8-6|=2. About 3 moves away.\n\n3. (9,5): Horizontal: |5-9|=4, vertical: |8-5|=3. About 7 moves away.\n\n4. (6,2): Horizontal: |5-6|=1, vertical: |8-2|=6. About 7 moves away.\n\n5. (1,4): Horizontal: |5-1|=4, vertical: |8-4|=4. About 8 moves away.\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,6) and (6,2), both around 7 moves away, but (4,6) is actually closer at 3 moves. However, I need to consider if there are any obstacles or risks in those paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider (4,6). It's close, only 3 moves away. Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (5,8):\n\n- Down to (5,7)\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\nSeems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in this path. Let's check if the enemy snake could interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), and its body is empty, so it's just the head at (9,4). If I move towards (4,6), the enemy is down at (9,4), so it's not in my way immediately. However, I need to consider if the enemy could move towards me in the next few turns.\n\nBut for now, the path seems clear. After eating the apple at (4,6), I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position would be (4,6), and my tail would have extended. Since I grew, my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next. Let's see the next closest apple after (4,6).\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,0): Still far.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |4-9|=5, vertical: |6-5|=1. About 6 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |4-6|=2, vertical: |6-2|=4. About 6 moves.\n\n- (1,4): Horizontal: |4-1|=3, vertical: |6-4|=2. About 5 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is now the closest at about 5 moves.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,6) to (1,4):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Down to (2,5)\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 moves, which matches my earlier estimate.\n\nI need to ensure that this path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,4), which is quite far horizontally, and assuming it moves towards me, it would take several moves to reach me. Meanwhile, I can reach (1,4) in 5 moves, so hopefully, I can get there before the enemy poses a threat.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that my own tail doesn't block my path. Since I'm growing, my tail will be extending, so I need to keep track of its positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (6,2) instead of (1,4) after (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves to (6,2), which is similar to going to (1,4).\n\nBut perhaps (6,2) is a better choice because it's further from the enemy's current position at (9,4).\n\nWait, but (6,2) is closer to the enemy than (1,4) is. The enemy is at (9,4), which is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (6,2):\n\nHorizontal: |9-6|=3, vertical: |4-2|=2. Total: 5 moves.\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (1,4):\n\nHorizontal: |9-1|=8, vertical: |4-4|=0. Total: 8 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4). Therefore, going to (1,4) might be safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,4), the next closest apple would be (2,0), which is still far, or (9,5), which is closer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (1,4), the remaining apples are:\n\n- (2,0): Horizontal: |1-2|=1, vertical: |4-0|=4. About 5 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |1-9|=8, vertical: |4-5|=1. About 9 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |1-6|=5, vertical: |4-2|=2. About 7 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Already considered.\n\nSo, (2,0) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nPath from (1,4) to (2,0):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,0), I would grow again, and then I can aim for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (9,5) after (4,6), even though it's farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (9,5):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\n- Right to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nBut the enemy is at (9,4), which is adjacent to (9,5). So, if I go to (9,5), the enemy might be able to reach me faster.\n\nPerhaps it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,2) after (4,6), even though the enemy is closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (6,2):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4), which is horizontally distant, so it would take some moves to reach me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,5) first, then (6,2), then (2,0),"

So, let's see the current situation.\n\nI'm controlling snake number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,7). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nThere are apples located at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). Also, there's an enemy snake at (9,5), with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top. Columns are from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (5,7), which is column 5, row 7.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,0): column 2, row 0\n\n- (4,6): column 4, row 6\n\n- (6,2): column 6, row 2\n\n- (1,4): column 1, row 4\n\n- (0,6): column 0, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,5), column 9, row 5, with its body at (9,4).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider which one is closest and safest to reach without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the distances from my current position (5,7) to each apple.\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-2| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-0| = 7\n\n- Total estimated moves: 3 + 7 = 10\n\n2. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-4| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-6| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-2| = 5\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-1| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-4| = 3\n\n- Total estimated moves: 4 + 3 = 7\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-0| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just 2 moves away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or my own tail.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (9,5), which is quite far from my current position and the apple at (4,6). So, it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the path to the apple.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Move down to (5,6)\n\n- Move left to (4,6)\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position is (4,6), and my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (4,6) to the remaining apples:\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-2| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-0| = 6\n\n- Total: 8 moves\n\n2. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-6| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-2| = 4\n\n- Total: 6 moves\n\n3. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Vertical: |6-4| = 2\n\n- Total: 5 moves\n\n4. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-0| = 4\n\n- Vertical: |6-6| = 0\n\n- Total: 4 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple from (4,6) is at (0,6), which is 4 moves away.\n\nLet me plan the path to (0,6):\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Left to (1,6)\n\n- Left to (0,6)\n\nThat's 4 moves to the left.\n\nI need to ensure that there are no obstacles in this path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), which is far away, and assuming no other snakes are in the way, this path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,6), I will grow again, so my tail will extend further.\n\nThen, I can aim for the next closest apple.\n\nLet's see from (0,6):\n\n- Apple at (1,4): 2 moves down and 1 to the right\n\n- Apple at (2,0): 6 moves down and 2 to the right\n\n- Apple at (4,6): already eaten\n\n- Apple at (6,2): 6 moves to the right and 4 down\n\nSo, the closest would be (1,4), which is 2 moves down and 1 to the right.\n\nFrom (0,6):\n\n- Down to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nThen, after eating (1,4), I can aim for (2,0), which is a bit farther, or (6,2).\n\nBut I think it's better to go for (2,0) next, as it's closer.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for (6,2) next, but that's farther.\n\nSo, sticking with (2,0) after (1,4) makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the enemy snake.\n\nIts head is at (9,5), and its body is at (9,4). So, it's likely to move up or down.\n\nI need to make sure that its path doesn't intersect with mine as I go for the apples.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), and I'm at (5,7), moving to (4,6) and then to (0,6), it seems like the enemy is on the opposite side of the board.\n\nAs long as I keep moving left and down, away from the enemy, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements in subsequent turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the apple at (4,6) seems like the best immediate action.\n\nSo, to reach (4,6) from (5,7), I need to move down to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the last move information, it seems that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nWait, no, according to the last move information:\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, it seems like there's some confusion here. Let me read the last move information again.\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid.

Let's recap the current situation.\n\nMy snake, number 2, is currently at position (5,6) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). There's an enemy snake at (9,5) with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (4,6), which is just one step to the left from my current position at (5,6). After eating that apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move left from (5,6) to (4,6) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. After eating the apple, I need to decide where to go next. The next closest apple would be at (0,6), which is directly to the left.\n\n3. From (4,6), I can move left to (3,6), then to (2,6), then to (1,6), and finally to (0,6).\n\n4. After eating the apple at (0,6), I should look for the next apple. The one at (1,4) seems accessible by moving down to (0,5), then (0,4), then right to (1,4).\n\n5. Finally, I can aim for the apple at (2,0), moving down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and then right to (2,0).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path. The enemy is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path immediately. However, I need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I don't run into my own tail as I grow longer. After eating the first apple at (4,6), my tail will extend, so I have to plan my moves to avoid it.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves in more detail:\n\n- Move left from (5,6) to (4,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (4,6).\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will remain at (5,6).\n\n- Move left from (4,6) to (3,6):\n\n  - No apple here, just moving.\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will be at (4,6).\n\n- Move left from (3,6) to (2,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (3,6).\n\n- Move left from (2,6) to (1,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (2,6).\n\n- Move left from (1,6) to (0,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (0,6).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,6) to (0,5):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,5) to (0,4):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,5).\n\n- Move right from (0,4) to (1,4):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (1,4).\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,4) to (1,3):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,3) to (1,2):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,3).\n\n- Move down from (1,2) to (1,1):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,2).\n\n- Move down from (1,1) to (1,0):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,1).\n\n- Move right from (1,0) to (2,0):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (2,0).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,0).\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan, assuming no obstacles or enemy interference.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a more efficient path or if I might be cutting off my own escape route.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving all the way to the left side of the board might put me closer to the enemy snake, which is currently at (9,5).

Assuming it can only move up, down, left, or right, and it's trying to eat apples or reach me, I need to predict its movements.\n\nBut for now, since it's on the opposite side of the board, I can focus on getting the closest apples first.\n\nSo, starting with (2,6):\n\n- Move up to (3,6).\n\n- Left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Left to (1,6).\n\n- Left to (0,6) to eat another apple.\n\n- Down to (0,5).\n\n- Down to (0,4).\n\n- Right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Down to (1,3).\n\n- Down to (1,2).\n\n- Down to (1,1).\n\n- Down to (1,0).\n\n- Right to (2,0) to eat the last apple.\n\nThat seems like a lot of moves, but it should work if I plan it carefully.\n\nWait, but I need to consider that after eating each apple, my tail grows, so I have to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the first few moves:\n\n- Move up from (3,5) to (3,6).\n\n- Now, I've moved into (3,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then, move left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Now, my tail is at (3,6).\n\n- Move left to (1,6).\n\n- Now, my tail is at (2,6).\n\n- Move left to (0,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Now, my tail is at (1,6).\n\n- Move down to (0,5).\n\n- Tail is at (0,6).\n\n- Move down to (0,4).\n\n- Tail is at (0,5).\n\n- Move right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Tail is at (0,4).\n\n- Move down to (1,3).\n\n- Tail is at (1,4).\n\n- Move down to (1,2).\n\n- Tail is at (1,3).\n\n- Move down to (1,1).\n\n- Tail is at (1,2).\n\n- Move down to (1,0).\n\n- Tail is at (1,1).\n\n- Move right to (2,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- Tail is at (1,0).\n\nThis seems manageable, as long as I don't make any mistakes.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake is at (7,7), and its body is at (8,7). Assuming it can only move in the four cardinal directions, it might try to move towards the remaining apples, like the one at (6,2).\n\nIf it moves left to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc., it might try to reach the apple at (6,2).\n\nBut for now, it's far away, so I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nI should focus on getting to (2,6), then (0,6), then (1,4), and finally (2,0).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (3,6).\n\nThen, left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, looking back, in the last move, I moved down to (3,5), and now I need to move up to (3,6). That seems a bit inefficient, but it's necessary to reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a better path.\n\nWait, from (3,5), I could move left to (2,5), then up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThat might be a better approach, as it's still two moves to the apple, but might be more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\n- Move left to (2,5).\n\n- Move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, left to (1,6), left to (0,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, down to (0,5), down to (0,4), right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), right to (2,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems similar to the previous path, but perhaps slightly more efficient in terms of direction changes.\n\nI need to make sure that moving left to (2,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (2,5) is empty, so it's safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,6), my tail will extend, so I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nOverall, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left to (2,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, continue left to (1,6), then (0,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, move down to (0,5), (0,4), right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and right to (2,0) to eat the last apple.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail during this process.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left to (2,5).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,8). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (9,5), (6,2), and (1,4). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm up near the top at (5,8). Let me sketch a small mental map:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 4: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nWhere 2 is me, 1 is the enemy snake, A's are apples, and '.' are empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity, danger, and potential paths.\n\nLet's list the apples and their distances from my current position:\n\n1. (2,0): That's quite far. Horizontal distance: |5-2|=3, vertical distance: |8-0|=8. So, about 11 moves away, assuming a straight path.\n\n2. (4,6): Horizontal: |5-4|=1, vertical: |8-6|=2. About 3 moves away.\n\n3. (9,5): Horizontal: |5-9|=4, vertical: |8-5|=3. About 7 moves away.\n\n4. (6,2): Horizontal: |5-6|=1, vertical: |8-2|=6. About 7 moves away.\n\n5. (1,4): Horizontal: |5-1|=4, vertical: |8-4|=4. About 8 moves away.\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,6) and (6,2), both around 7 moves away, but (4,6) is actually closer at 3 moves. However, I need to consider if there are any obstacles or risks in those paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider (4,6). It's close, only 3 moves away. Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (5,8):\n\n- Down to (5,7)\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\nSeems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in this path. Let's check if the enemy snake could interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), and its body is empty, so it's just the head at (9,4). If I move towards (4,6), the enemy is down at (9,4), so it's not in my way immediately. However, I need to consider if the enemy could move towards me in the next few turns.\n\nBut for now, the path seems clear. After eating the apple at (4,6), I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position would be (4,6), and my tail would have extended. Since I grew, my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next. Let's see the next closest apple after (4,6).\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,0): Still far.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |4-9|=5, vertical: |6-5|=1. About 6 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |4-6|=2, vertical: |6-2|=4. About 6 moves.\n\n- (1,4): Horizontal: |4-1|=3, vertical: |6-4|=2. About 5 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is now the closest at about 5 moves.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,6) to (1,4):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Down to (2,5)\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 moves, which matches my earlier estimate.\n\nI need to ensure that this path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,4), which is quite far horizontally, and assuming it moves towards me, it would take several moves to reach me. Meanwhile, I can reach (1,4) in 5 moves, so hopefully, I can get there before the enemy poses a threat.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that my own tail doesn't block my path. Since I'm growing, my tail will be extending, so I need to keep track of its positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (6,2) instead of (1,4) after (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves to (6,2), which is similar to going to (1,4).\n\nBut perhaps (6,2) is a better choice because it's further from the enemy's current position at (9,4).\n\nWait, but (6,2) is closer to the enemy than (1,4) is. The enemy is at (9,4), which is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (6,2):\n\nHorizontal: |9-6|=3, vertical: |4-2|=2. Total: 5 moves.\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (1,4):\n\nHorizontal: |9-1|=8, vertical: |4-4|=0. Total: 8 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4). Therefore, going to (1,4) might be safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,4), the next closest apple would be (2,0), which is still far, or (9,5), which is closer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (1,4), the remaining apples are:\n\n- (2,0): Horizontal: |1-2|=1, vertical: |4-0|=4. About 5 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |1-9|=8, vertical: |4-5|=1. About 9 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |1-6|=5, vertical: |4-2|=2. About 7 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Already considered.\n\nSo, (2,0) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nPath from (1,4) to (2,0):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,0), I would grow again, and then I can aim for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (9,5) after (4,6), even though it's farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (9,5):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\n- Right to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nBut the enemy is at (9,4), which is adjacent to (9,5). So, if I go to (9,5), the enemy might be able to reach me faster.\n\nPerhaps it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,2) after (4,6), even though the enemy is closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (6,2):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4), which is horizontally distant, so it would take some moves to reach me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,5) first, then (6,2), then (2,0),"

So, let's see the current situation.\n\nI'm controlling snake number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,7).

Also, there's an enemy snake at (9,5), with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top. Columns are from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (5,7), which is column 5, row 7.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,0): column 2, row 0\n\n- (4,6): column 4, row 6\n\n- (6,2): column 6, row 2\n\n- (1,4): column 1, row 4\n\n- (0,6): column 0, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,5), column 9, row 5, with its body at (9,4).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider which one is closest and safest to reach without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the distances from my current position (5,7) to each apple.\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-2| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-0| = 7\n\n- Total estimated moves: 3 + 7 = 10\n\n2. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-4| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-6| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-2| = 5\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-1| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-4| = 3\n\n- Total estimated moves: 4 + 3 = 7\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-0| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just 2 moves away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or my own tail.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (9,5), which is quite far from my current position and the apple at (4,6). So, it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the path to the apple.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Move down to (5,6)\n\n- Move left to (4,6)\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position is (4,6), and my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (4,6) to the remaining apples:\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-2| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-0| = 6\n\n- Total: 8 moves\n\n2. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-6| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-2| = 4\n\n- Total: 6 moves\n\n3. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Vertical: |6-4| = 2\n\n- Total: 5 moves\n\n4. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-0| = 4\n\n- Vertical: |6-6| = 0\n\n- Total: 4 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple from (4,6) is at (0,6), which is 4 moves away.\n\nLet me plan the path to (0,6):\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Left to (1,6)\n\n- Left to (0,6)\n\nThat's 4 moves to the left.\n\nI need to ensure that there are no obstacles in this path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), which is far away, and assuming no other snakes are in the way, this path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,6), I will grow again, so my tail will extend further.\n\nThen, I can aim for the next closest apple.\n\nLet's see from (0,6):\n\n- Apple at (1,4): 2 moves down and 1 to the right\n\n- Apple at (2,0): 6 moves down and 2 to the right\n\n- Apple at (4,6): already eaten\n\n- Apple at (6,2): 6 moves to the right and 4 down\n\nSo, the closest would be (1,4), which is 2 moves down and 1 to the right.\n\nFrom (0,6):\n\n- Down to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nThen, after eating (1,4), I can aim for (2,0), which is a bit farther, or (6,2).\n\nBut I think it's better to go for (2,0) next, as it's closer.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for (6,2) next, but that's farther.\n\nSo, sticking with (2,0) after (1,4) makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the enemy snake.\n\nIts head is at (9,5), and its body is at (9,4). So, it's likely to move up or down.\n\nI need to make sure that its path doesn't intersect with mine as I go for the apples.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), and I'm at (5,7), moving to (4,6) and then to (0,6), it seems like the enemy is on the opposite side of the board.\n\nAs long as I keep moving left and down, away from the enemy, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements in subsequent turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the apple at (4,6) seems like the best immediate action.\n\nSo, to reach (4,6) from (5,7), I need to move down to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the last move information, it seems that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nWait, no, according to the last move information:\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, it seems like there's some confusion here. Let me read the last move information again.\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid.

The apple at (0,6) is to my left and up, but moving towards it would require me to go around the enemy snake, which could be risky. The apple at (1,4) is to my left and down, but moving towards it would require me to go around the enemy snake, which could be risky. The apple at (2,0) is to my left and down, but moving towards it would require me to go around the enemy snake, which could be risky. My best option is to move up to (9,7) and then left to (8,7) to avoid the enemy snake and head towards the apple at (6,2). My strategy for the next turn will be to continue looking for the closest apples and avoid any potential threats.\n\nNext move: UP"

There's an enemy snake at (9,5) with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (4,6), which is just one step to the left from my current position at (5,6). After eating that apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves:\n\n1.

Finally, I can aim for the apple at (2,0), moving down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and then right to (2,0).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path. The enemy is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path immediately. However, I need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I don't run into my own tail as I grow longer. After eating the first apple at (4,6), my tail will extend, so I have to plan my moves to avoid it.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves in more detail:\n\n- Move left from (5,6) to (4,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (4,6).\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will remain at (5,6).\n\n- Move left from (4,6) to (3,6):\n\n  - No apple here, just moving.\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will be at (4,6).\n\n- Move left from (3,6) to (2,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (3,6).\n\n- Move left from (2,6) to (1,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (2,6).\n\n- Move left from (1,6) to (0,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (0,6).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,6) to (0,5):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,5) to (0,4):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,5).\n\n- Move right from (0,4) to (1,4):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (1,4).\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,4) to (1,3):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,3) to (1,2):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,3).\n\n- Move down from (1,2) to (1,1):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,2).\n\n- Move down from (1,1) to (1,0):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,1).\n\n- Move right from (1,0) to (2,0):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (2,0).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,0).\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan, assuming no obstacles or enemy interference.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a more efficient path or if I might be cutting off my own escape route.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving all the way to the left side of the board might put me closer to the enemy snake, which is currently at (9,5). If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape plan.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (4,6), I could consider going for the apple at (6,2), which is also relatively close.\n\nLet me compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1: (4,6) -> (0,6) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 1 (to 4,6) + 4 (to 0,6) + 3 (to 1,4) + 5 (to 2,0) = 13 moves\n\nPath 2: (4,6) -> (6,2) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 moves to (6,2)\n\nThen, from (6,2):\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (2,4)\n\n- Up to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\n- Left to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9 moves to (1,4)\n\nThen, from (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 4 + 1 = 5 moves to (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 9 + 5 = 19 moves\n\nComparing to Path 1, which is 13 moves, Path 1 is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, I should stick with Path 1.\n\nNow, considering that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6), and now I'm at (5,6), my next move should be to the left to (4,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut wait, in the board state, it shows me at (5,6), but according to the last move, I moved down to (5,6).

Let's recap the current situation.\n\nMy snake, number 2, is currently at position (3,5) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (2,0), (6,2), (1,4), (0,6), and (2,6). There's an enemy snake at (7,7) with its body at (8,7).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (2,6), which is just one step to the left from my current position at (3,5). Wait, actually, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 1 T .\n\nRow 6: A . A T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: .

So, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves:\n\n1. From (3,5), I can move up to (3,6).\n\n2. Then left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n3. Then left to (1,6), then left to (0,6) to eat another apple.\n\n4. Then down to (0,5), down to (0,4), then right to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\n5. Then down to (1,3), down to (1,2), down to (1,1), down to (1,0), then right to (2,0) to eat the last apple.\n\nThis seems like a possible path, but I need to make sure it's safe and efficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (6,2), but that seems farther away, involving moving right to (4,5), up to (4,6), etc., which might take more moves and potentially put me in the path of the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, sticking to the closer apples seems better.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake. It's at (7,7), and its body is at (8,7). Assuming it can only move up, down, left, or right, and it's trying to eat apples or reach me, I need to predict its movements.\n\nBut for now, since it's on the opposite side of the board, I can focus on getting the closest apples first.\n\nSo, starting with (2,6):\n\n- Move up to (3,6).\n\n- Left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Left to (1,6).\n\n- Left to (0,6) to eat another apple.\n\n- Down to (0,5).\n\n- Down to (0,4).\n\n- Right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Down to (1,3).\n\n- Down to (1,2).\n\n- Down to (1,1).\n\n- Down to (1,0).\n\n- Right to (2,0) to eat the last apple.\n\nThat seems like a lot of moves, but it should work if I plan it carefully.\n\nWait, but I need to consider that after eating each apple, my tail grows, so I have to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the first few moves:\n\n- Move up from (3,5) to (3,6).\n\n- Now, I've moved into (3,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then, move left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Now, my tail is at (3,6).\n\n- Move left to (1,6).\n\n- Now, my tail is at (2,6).\n\n- Move left to (0,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Now, my tail is at (1,6).\n\n- Move down to (0,5).\n\n- Tail is at (0,6).\n\n- Move down to (0,4).\n\n- Tail is at (0,5).\n\n- Move right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Tail is at (0,4).\n\n- Move down to (1,3).\n\n- Tail is at (1,4).\n\n- Move down to (1,2).\n\n- Tail is at (1,3).\n\n- Move down to (1,1).\n\n- Tail is at (1,2).\n\n- Move down to (1,0).\n\n- Tail is at (1,1).\n\n- Move right to (2,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- Tail is at (1,0).\n\nThis seems manageable, as long as I don't make any mistakes.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake is at (7,7), and its body is at (8,7). Assuming it can only move in the four cardinal directions, it might try to move towards the remaining apples, like the one at (6,2).\n\nIf it moves left to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc., it might try to reach the apple at (6,2).\n\nBut for now, it's far away, so I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nI should focus on getting to (2,6), then (0,6), then (1,4), and finally (2,0).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (3,6).\n\nThen, left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, looking back, in the last move, I moved down to (3,5), and now I need to move up to (3,6). That seems a bit inefficient, but it's necessary to reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a better path.\n\nWait, from (3,5), I could move left to (2,5), then up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThat might be a better approach, as it's still two moves to the apple, but might be more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\n- Move left to (2,5).\n\n- Move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, left to (1,6), left to (0,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, down to (0,5), down to (0,4), right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), right to (2,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems similar to the previous path, but perhaps slightly more efficient in terms of direction changes.\n\nI need to make sure that moving left to (2,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (2,5) is empty, so it's safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,6), my tail will extend, so I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nOverall, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left to (2,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, continue left to (1,6), then (0,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, move down to (0,5), (0,4), right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and right to (2,0) to eat the last apple.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail during this process.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left to (2,5).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (1,4), but that's somewhat in the middle of my path after getting the apples at (2,6) and (0,6).\n\nLet me think about potential obstacles.\n\nFirst, after eating the apple at (2,6), my tail extends to (2,5).\n\nThen, moving left to (1,6), tail extends to (2,6).\n\nNext, left to (0,6), tail extends to (1,6).\n\nThen down to (0,5), tail extends to (0,6).\n\nDown to (0,4), tail extends to (0,5).\n\nRight to (1,4), tail extends to (0,4).\n\nDown to (1,3), tail extends to (1,4).\n\nDown to (1,2), tail extends to (1,3).\n\nDown to (1,1), tail extends to (1,2).\n\nDown to (1,0), tail extends to (1,1).\n\nRight to (2,0), tail extends to (1,0).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me into my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (6,7) with its body at (7,7). It's on the opposite side, so it shouldn't interfere with my path for now.\n\nI need to be cautious as I grow and make sure my path doesn't lead me into a dead end or into my own tail.\n\nLet me visualize the path:\n\n1. Up to (2,6) - eat apple\n\n2. Left to (1,6)\n\n3. Left to (0,6) - eat apple\n\n4. Down to (0,5)\n\n5. Down to (0,4)\n\n6. Right to (1,4) - eat apple\n\n7. Down to (1,3)\n\n8. Down to (1,2)\n\n9.

Right to (2,0) - eat apple\n\nI should check if any of these positions are occupied by my future tail.\n\nFor example, when I move to (1,6), my tail is at (2,6). Then moving to (0,6), tail is at (1,6), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my head moves into where my tail is about to be.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky, but if I follow the path step by step, it should be manageable.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I grow, the board space becomes more constrained, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should keep an eye on the enemy snake's possible movements. If it starts moving towards my path, I may need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the closest apples first seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nWait a minute, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,5). If I move up now to (2,6), I need to make sure that my tail extends correctly.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,6), my tail will be at (2,5).\n\nThen, moving left to (1,6), tail extends to (2,6).\n\nThen left to (0,6), tail extends to (1,6).\n\nThen down to (0,5), tail extends to (0,6).\n\nThen down to (0,4), tail extends to (0,5).\n\nThen right to (1,4), tail extends to (0,4).\n\nThen down to (1,3), tail extends to (1,4).\n\nThen down to (1,2), tail extends to (1,3).\n\nThen down to (1,1), tail extends to (1,2).\n\nThen down to (1,0), tail extends to (1,1).\n\nThen right to (2,0), tail extends to (1,0).\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (6,7), so it's not in my path.\n\nMy own tail will be growing, but as long as I follow this path, I shouldn't run into it.\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I should move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,8). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (9,5), (6,2), and (1,4). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm up near the top at (5,8). Let me sketch a small mental map:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . A . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n- Row 4: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nWhere 2 is me, 1 is the enemy snake, A's are apples, and '.' are empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity, danger, and potential paths.\n\nLet's list the apples and their distances from my current position:\n\n1. (2,0): That's quite far. Horizontal distance: |5-2|=3, vertical distance: |8-0|=8. So, about 11 moves away, assuming a straight path.\n\n2. (4,6): Horizontal: |5-4|=1, vertical: |8-6|=2. About 3 moves away.\n\n3. (9,5): Horizontal: |5-9|=4, vertical: |8-5|=3. About 7 moves away.\n\n4. (6,2): Horizontal: |5-6|=1, vertical: |8-2|=6. About 7 moves away.\n\n5. (1,4): Horizontal: |5-1|=4, vertical: |8-4|=4. About 8 moves away.\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,6) and (6,2), both around 7 moves away, but (4,6) is actually closer at 3 moves. However, I need to consider if there are any obstacles or risks in those paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider (4,6). It's close, only 3 moves away. Let's see the path:\n\nFrom (5,8):\n\n- Down to (5,7)\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Left to (4,6)\n\nSeems straightforward. No immediate obstacles in this path. Let's check if the enemy snake could interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,4), and its body is empty, so it's just the head at (9,4). If I move towards (4,6), the enemy is down at (9,4), so it's not in my way immediately. However, I need to consider if the enemy could move towards me in the next few turns.\n\nBut for now, the path seems clear. After eating the apple at (4,6), I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't bump into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position would be (4,6), and my tail would have extended. Since I grew, my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next. Let's see the next closest apple after (4,6).\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,0): Still far.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |4-9|=5, vertical: |6-5|=1. About 6 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |4-6|=2, vertical: |6-2|=4. About 6 moves.\n\n- (1,4): Horizontal: |4-1|=3, vertical: |6-4|=2. About 5 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is now the closest at about 5 moves.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,6) to (1,4):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Down to (2,5)\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 moves, which matches my earlier estimate.\n\nI need to ensure that this path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,4), which is quite far horizontally, and assuming it moves towards me, it would take several moves to reach me. Meanwhile, I can reach (1,4) in 5 moves, so hopefully, I can get there before the enemy poses a threat.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that my own tail doesn't block my path. Since I'm growing, my tail will be extending, so I need to keep track of its positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (6,2) instead of (1,4) after (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves to (6,2), which is similar to going to (1,4).\n\nBut perhaps (6,2) is a better choice because it's further from the enemy's current position at (9,4).\n\nWait, but (6,2) is closer to the enemy than (1,4) is. The enemy is at (9,4), which is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (6,2):\n\nHorizontal: |9-6|=3, vertical: |4-2|=2. Total: 5 moves.\n\nDistance from enemy at (9,4) to (1,4):\n\nHorizontal: |9-1|=8, vertical: |4-4|=0. Total: 8 moves.\n\nSo, the enemy is closer to (6,2) than to (1,4). Therefore, going to (1,4) might be safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,4), the next closest apple would be (2,0), which is still far, or (9,5), which is closer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom (1,4), the remaining apples are:\n\n- (2,0): Horizontal: |1-2|=1, vertical: |4-0|=4. About 5 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Horizontal: |1-9|=8, vertical: |4-5|=1. About 9 moves.\n\n- (6,2): Horizontal: |1-6|=5, vertical: |4-2|=2. About 7 moves.\n\n- (9,5): Already considered.\n\nSo, (2,0) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nPath from (1,4) to (2,0):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,0), I would grow again, and then I can aim for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (9,5) after (4,6), even though it's farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (9,5):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\n- Right to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nBut the enemy is at (9,4), which is adjacent to (9,5). So, if I go to (9,5), the enemy might be able to reach me faster.\n\nPerhaps it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,2) after (4,6), even though the enemy is closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (6,2):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4), which is horizontally distant, so it would take some moves to reach me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,5) first, then (6,2), then (2,0),"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this snake game. So, let's see the current situation.\n\nI'm controlling snake number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,7). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nThere are apples located at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). Also, there's an enemy snake at (9,5), with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top. Columns are from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (5,7), which is column 5, row 7.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,0): column 2, row 0\n\n- (4,6): column 4, row 6\n\n- (6,2): column 6, row 2\n\n- (1,4): column 1, row 4\n\n- (0,6): column 0, row 6\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,5), column 9, row 5, with its body at (9,4).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider which one is closest and safest to reach without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me think about the distances from my current position (5,7) to each apple.\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-2| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-0| = 7\n\n- Total estimated moves: 3 + 7 = 10\n\n2. Apple at (4,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-4| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-6| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-2| = 5\n\n- Total estimated moves: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-1| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-4| = 3\n\n- Total estimated moves: 4 + 3 = 7\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |5-0| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |7-6| = 1\n\n- Total estimated moves: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6), which is just 2 moves away. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or my own tail.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (9,5), which is quite far from my current position and the apple at (4,6). So, it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the path to the apple.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Move down to (5,6)\n\n- Move left to (4,6)\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that in the next moves, I don't accidentally run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,6), my new position is (4,6), and my tail will have an additional segment.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (4,6) to the remaining apples:\n\n1. Apple at (2,0):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-2| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-0| = 6\n\n- Total: 8 moves\n\n2. Apple at (6,2):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-6| = 2\n\n- Vertical: |6-2| = 4\n\n- Total: 6 moves\n\n3. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Vertical: |6-4| = 2\n\n- Total: 5 moves\n\n4. Apple at (0,6):\n\n- Horizontal: |4-0| = 4\n\n- Vertical: |6-6| = 0\n\n- Total: 4 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple from (4,6) is at (0,6), which is 4 moves away.\n\nLet me plan the path to (0,6):\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Left to (3,6)\n\n- Left to (2,6)\n\n- Left to (1,6)\n\n- Left to (0,6)\n\nThat's 4 moves to the left.\n\nI need to ensure that there are no obstacles in this path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), which is far away, and assuming no other snakes are in the way, this path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,6), I will grow again, so my tail will extend further.\n\nThen, I can aim for the next closest apple.\n\nLet's see from (0,6):\n\n- Apple at (1,4): 2 moves down and 1 to the right\n\n- Apple at (2,0): 6 moves down and 2 to the right\n\n- Apple at (4,6): already eaten\n\n- Apple at (6,2): 6 moves to the right and 4 down\n\nSo, the closest would be (1,4), which is 2 moves down and 1 to the right.\n\nFrom (0,6):\n\n- Down to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Right to (1,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nThen, after eating (1,4), I can aim for (2,0), which is a bit farther, or (6,2).\n\nBut I think it's better to go for (2,0) next, as it's closer.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for (6,2) next, but that's farther.\n\nSo, sticking with (2,0) after (1,4) makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the enemy snake.\n\nIts head is at (9,5), and its body is at (9,4). So, it's likely to move up or down.\n\nI need to make sure that its path doesn't intersect with mine as I go for the apples.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (9,5), and I'm at (5,7), moving to (4,6) and then to (0,6), it seems like the enemy is on the opposite side of the board.\n\nAs long as I keep moving left and down, away from the enemy, I should be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements in subsequent turns.\n\nFor now, focusing on eating the apple at (4,6) seems like the best immediate action.\n\nSo, to reach (4,6) from (5,7), I need to move down to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the last move information, it seems that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nWait, no, according to the last move information:\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, it seems like there's some confusion here. Let me read the last move information again.\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,7). There are apples at (2,0), (4,6), (6,2), (1,4), and (0,6). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\n...\n\nSo, in the last move, I decided to move down from (5,7) to (5,6).\n\nNow, considering that, and assuming that move has already been executed, my current position should be (5,6).\n\nBut in the board state provided, it shows me at (5,7), which might be a confusion.\n\nWait, in the board state:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . .

There's an enemy snake at (9,5) with its body at (9,4).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (4,6), which is just one step to the left from my current position at (5,6). After eating that apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move left from (5,6) to (4,6) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. After eating the apple, I need to decide where to go next. The next closest apple would be at (0,6), which is directly to the left.\n\n3.

The enemy is at (9,5), which is on the opposite side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path immediately. However, I need to keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I don't run into my own tail as I grow longer. After eating the first apple at (4,6), my tail will extend, so I have to plan my moves to avoid it.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves in more detail:\n\n- Move left from (5,6) to (4,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (4,6).\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will remain at (5,6).\n\n- Move left from (4,6) to (3,6):\n\n  - No apple here, just moving.\n\n  - My tail will extend, so the last segment will be at (4,6).\n\n- Move left from (3,6) to (2,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (3,6).\n\n- Move left from (2,6) to (1,6):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (2,6).\n\n- Move left from (1,6) to (0,6):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (0,6).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,6) to (0,5):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,6).\n\n- Move down from (0,5) to (0,4):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,5).\n\n- Move right from (0,4) to (1,4):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (1,4).\n\n  - Tail extends to (0,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,4) to (1,3):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,4).\n\n- Move down from (1,3) to (1,2):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,3).\n\n- Move down from (1,2) to (1,1):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,2).\n\n- Move down from (1,1) to (1,0):\n\n  - No apple here.\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,1).\n\n- Move right from (1,0) to (2,0):\n\n  - Eat the apple at (2,0).\n\n  - Tail extends to (1,0).\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan, assuming no obstacles or enemy interference.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's a more efficient path or if I might be cutting off my own escape route.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving all the way to the left side of the board might put me closer to the enemy snake, which is currently at (9,5). If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape plan.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (4,6), I could consider going for the apple at (6,2), which is also relatively close.\n\nLet me compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1: (4,6) -> (0,6) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 1 (to 4,6) + 4 (to 0,6) + 3 (to 1,4) + 5 (to 2,0) = 13 moves\n\nPath 2: (4,6) -> (6,2) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 moves to (6,2)\n\nThen, from (6,2):\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (2,4)\n\n- Up to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\n- Left to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9 moves to (1,4)\n\nThen, from (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 4 + 1 = 5 moves to (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 9 + 5 = 19 moves\n\nComparing to Path 1, which is 13 moves, Path 1 is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, I should stick with Path 1.\n\nNow, considering that in the last move, I moved down from (5,7) to (5,6), and now I'm at (5,6), my next move should be to the left to (4,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut wait, in the board state, it shows me at (5,6), but according to the last move, I moved down to (5,6). So, assuming that move has been executed, my current position is (5,6).\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the left to (4,6).\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . .

If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape plan.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (2,6), I could consider going for the apple at (6,2), which is also relatively close.\n\nLet me compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1: (2,6) -> (0,6) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 2 (to 2,6) + 2 (to 0,6) + 3 (to 1,4) + 5 (to 2,0) = 12 moves\n\nPath 2: (2,6) -> (6,2) -> (1,4) -> (2,0)\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\n- Right to (3,6)\n\n- Right to (4,6)\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\n- Down to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\nThat's 4 + 3 = 7 moves to (6,2)\n\nThen, from (6,2):\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (2,4)\n\n- Up to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\n- Left to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9 moves to (1,4)\n\nThen, from (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\nThat's 4 + 1 = 5 moves to (2,0)\n\nTotal moves: 7 + 9 + 5 = 21 moves\n\nComparing to Path 1, which is 12 moves, Path 1 is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, I should stick with Path 1.\n\nNow, considering that in the last move, I moved left from (5,6) to (4,6), and now I'm at (4,6), my next move should be to the left to (3,6).\n\nBut wait, in the board state, it shows me at (4,6), and there's an apple at (2,6).

So, I need to confirm the current positions.\n\nWait, in the initial board state, it shows my snake at (4,6), and apples at (2,0), (6,2), (1,4), (0,6), and (2,6).\n\nSo, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6), then to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,6), I need to move left to (1,6), then to (0,6) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, move down to (0,5), then (0,4), then right to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nFinally, move down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), then right to (2,0) to eat the last apple.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't going to interfere. Given that the enemy is at (9,7), and assuming it moves upwards or stays put, it shouldn't block my path to the left.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, my immediate move should be to the left to (3,6), progressing towards the apple at (2,6).\n\nBut, I need to confirm if moving left from (4,6) to (3,6) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . .

It's at (7,7), and its body is at (8,7). Assuming it can only move up, down, left, or right, and it's trying to eat apples or reach me, I need to predict its movements.\n\nBut for now, since it's on the opposite side of the board, I can focus on getting the closest apples first.\n\nSo, starting with (2,6):\n\n- Move up to (3,6).\n\n- Left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Left to (1,6).\n\n- Left to (0,6) to eat another apple.\n\n- Down to (0,5).\n\n- Down to (0,4).\n\n- Right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Down to (1,3).\n\n- Down to (1,2).\n\n- Down to (1,1).\n\n- Down to (1,0).\n\n- Right to (2,0) to eat the last apple.\n\nThat seems like a lot of moves, but it should work if I plan it carefully.\n\nWait, but I need to consider that after eating each apple, my tail grows, so I have to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the first few moves:\n\n- Move up from (3,5) to (3,6).\n\n- Now, I've moved into (3,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then, move left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Now, my tail is at (3,6).\n\n- Move left to (1,6).\n\n- Now, my tail is at (2,6).\n\n- Move left to (0,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Now, my tail is at (1,6).\n\n- Move down to (0,5).\n\n- Tail is at (0,6).\n\n- Move down to (0,4).\n\n- Tail is at (0,5).\n\n- Move right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Tail is at (0,4).\n\n- Move down to (1,3).\n\n- Tail is at (1,4).\n\n- Move down to (1,2).\n\n- Tail is at (1,3).\n\n- Move down to (1,1).\n\n- Tail is at (1,2).\n\n- Move down to (1,0).\n\n- Tail is at (1,1).\n\n- Move right to (2,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- Tail is at (1,0).\n\nThis seems manageable, as long as I don't make any mistakes.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake is at (7,7), and its body is at (8,7). Assuming it can only move in the four cardinal directions, it might try to move towards the remaining apples, like the one at (6,2).\n\nIf it moves left to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc., it might try to reach the apple at (6,2).\n\nBut for now, it's far away, so I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nI should focus on getting to (2,6), then (0,6), then (1,4), and finally (2,0).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (3,6).\n\nThen, left to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, looking back, in the last move, I moved down to (3,5), and now I need to move up to (3,6). That seems a bit inefficient, but it's necessary to reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a better path.\n\nWait, from (3,5), I could move left to (2,5), then up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThat might be a better approach, as it's still two moves to the apple, but might be more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\n- Move left to (2,5).\n\n- Move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, left to (1,6), left to (0,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, down to (0,5), down to (0,4), right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), right to (2,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems similar to the previous path, but perhaps slightly more efficient in terms of direction changes.\n\nI need to make sure that moving left to (2,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (2,5) is empty, so it's safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,6), my tail will extend, so I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nOverall, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left to (2,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, continue left to (1,6), then (0,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, move down to (0,5), (0,4), right to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and right to (2,0) to eat the last apple.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail during this process.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left to (2,5).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,5), which is column 2, row 5.\n\nThe apple at (2,6) is directly above me at column 2, row 6.\n\nSo, from (2,5), I can move up to (2,6) to eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll grow, so my tail will be at (2,5).\n\nNext, I can move left to (1,6), then to (0,6) to eat another apple there.\n\nThen, I can move down to (0,5), then to (0,4), then right to (1,4) to eat the apple at (1,4).\n\nThen, move down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and finally right to (2,0) to eat the last apple there.\n\nThis seems like a feasible path, but I need to make sure it's safe and efficient.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (6,2), but that's farther away, and moving towards it might put me in the path of the enemy snake, which is at (6,7). I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (1,4), but that's somewhat in the middle of my path after getting the apples at (2,6) and (0,6).\n\nLet me think about potential obstacles.\n\nFirst, after eating the apple at (2,6), my tail extends to (2,5).\n\nThen, moving left to (1,6), tail extends to (2,6).\n\nNext, left to (0,6), tail extends to (1,6).\n\nThen down to (0,5), tail extends to (0,6).\n\nDown to (0,4), tail extends to (0,5).\n\nRight to (1,4), tail extends to (0,4).\n\nDown to (1,3), tail extends to (1,4).\n\nDown to (1,2), tail extends to (1,3).\n\nDown to (1,1), tail extends to (1,2).\n\nDown to (1,0), tail extends to (1,1).\n\nRight to (2,0), tail extends to (1,0).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me into my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (6,7) with its body at (7,7). It's on the opposite side, so it shouldn't interfere with my path for now.\n\nI need to be cautious as I grow and make sure my path doesn't lead me into a dead end or into my own tail.\n\nLet me visualize the path:\n\n1. Up to (2,6) - eat apple\n\n2. Left to (1,6)\n\n3. Left to (0,6) - eat apple\n\n4. Down to (0,5)\n\n5. Down to (0,4)\n\n6. Right to (1,4) - eat apple\n\n7. Down to (1,3)\n\n8. Down to (1,2)\n\n9. Down to (1,1)\n\n10. Down to (1,0)\n\n11. Right to (2,0) - eat apple\n\nI should check if any of these positions are occupied by my future tail.\n\nFor example, when I move to (1,6), my tail is at (2,6). Then moving to (0,6), tail is at (1,6), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my head moves into where my tail is about to be.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky, but if I follow the path step by step, it should be manageable.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I grow, the board space becomes more constrained, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should keep an eye on the enemy snake's possible movements. If it starts moving towards my path, I may need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the closest apples first seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nWait a minute, but in the last move, I moved left to (2,5). If I move up now to (2,6), I need to make sure that my tail extends correctly.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,6), my tail will be at (2,5).\n\nThen, moving left to (1,6), tail extends to (2,6).\n\nThen left to (0,6), tail extends to (1,6).\n\nThen down to (0,5), tail extends to (0,6).\n\nThen down to (0,4), tail extends to (0,5).\n\nThen right to (1,4), tail extends to (0,4).\n\nThen down to (1,3), tail extends to (1,4).\n\nThen down to (1,2), tail extends to (1,3).\n\nThen down to (1,1), tail extends to (1,2).\n\nThen down to (1,0), tail extends to (1,1).\n\nThen right to (2,0), tail extends to (1,0).\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (6,7), so it's not in my path.\n\nMy own tail will be growing, but as long as I follow this path, I shouldn't run into it.\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I should move up to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

Moving towards (6,2) would require me to go right, but I need to be cautious of any potential moves from the enemy snake.

Let's recap the current situation.\n\nMy snake, number 2, is currently at position (2,6) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (2,0), (6,2), (1,4), (0,6), and (9,4). There's an enemy snake at (5,7) with its body at (6,7).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,6), which is just two steps to the left from my current position at (2,6).

I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (1,4), which is somewhat in the middle of my path after getting the apples at (0,6) and (2,6).\n\nLet me think about potential obstacles.\n\nFirst, after eating the apple at (0,6), my tail extends to (1,6).\n\nThen, moving down to (0,5), tail extends to (0,6).\n\nNext, down to (0,4), tail extends to (0,5).\n\nThen right to (1,4), tail extends to (0,4).\n\nThen down to (1,3), tail extends to (1,4).\n\nThen down to (1,2), tail extends to (1,3).\n\nThen down to (1,1), tail extends to (1,2).\n\nThen down to (1,0), tail extends to (1,1).\n\nThen right to (2,0), tail extends to (1,0).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these moves put me into my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (5,7), which is on the opposite side, so it shouldn't interfere with my path for now.\n\nI need to be cautious as I grow and make sure my path doesn't lead me into a dead end or into my own tail.\n\nLet me visualize the path:\n\n1.
