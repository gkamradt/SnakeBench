            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nThe board is a 10x10 grid, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, ID 1, is currently at (9,0). So that's the very bottom right corner. The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (8,1), which is just above me. It doesn't have any body segments listed, so I guess it's just the head.\n\nLooking at the apples, they're at positions (2,4), (7,0), (4,2), (9,7), and (6,2). My immediate thought is to check which of these are closest to me because I want to collect an apple to grow and score points.\n\nLet me list out the distances from my current position (9,0) to each apple:\n\n1. (2,4): The x distance is 9-2=7, and the y distance is 4-0=4. So, total distance is 11 steps.\n2. (7,0): x distance is 9-7=2, y distance is 0-0=0. So, 2 steps. That's really close.\n3. (4,2): x distance is 9-4=5, y distance is 2-0=2. Total 7 steps.\n4. (9,7): That's straight up from me, y distance 7-0=7. So, 7 steps.\n5. (6,2): x distance 9-6=3, y distance 2-0=2. Total 5 steps.\n\nSo the closest apples are (7,0) and (9,7). (7,0) is only two steps away, which is great. But I need to think about the possible risks.\n\nMy snake is at (9,0). To get to (7,0), I'd have to move LEFT twice. But moving left from (9,0) would take me to (8,0), then (7,0). However, I should check if there's anything in those positions. From the board state, the row 0 has my snake at (9,0), and enemy snake 2 is at (8,1). So, (8,0) isn't mentioned, so probably empty. So moving left twice would get me to (7,0), where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nBut wait, enemy snake 2 is at (8,1). If I move left to (8,0), that's adjacent to enemy's position (8,1). But the rules say that if two snakes collide, they both die. So I have to be careful. However, since I'm moving into (8,0) and enemy is at (8,1), it's only in the adjacent cell, not the same. So that might not be a problem unless the enemy moves into (8,0) as well, but I don't have info on the enemy's next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving UP to (9,1), then LEFT to (8,1), but wait, enemy is at (8,1). So that would be dangerous because I'd be moving into their position, which would cause a collision, and I'd die. So that's not a good idea.\n\nSo, the safest bet is to move LEFT twice to reach (7,0) and collect the apple. Let me see if that's possible without hitting anything. Moving left once from (9,0) is to (8,0), which is empty. Then left again to (7,0), which is the apple. So that should be safe.\n\nI should also consider the other apples. (9,7) is seven steps up, but maybe that's too far. Also, there's an enemy at (8,1); if I start moving up, I might be in the same column as the enemy, but they're a row above. As long as I don't run into them, I should be fine.\n\nWait, but if I go for (7,0) first, I can grow and then maybe go for another apple. Collecting (7,0) would give me the point, and I'd be at (7,0), which is a better position to then go for other apples.\n\nSo, the plan is to move LEFT twice to get to (7,0). But since the game is turn-based, I can't move twice in one turn. So my next move should be LEFT, which would take me from (9,0) to (8,0). Then, in the next turn, another LEFT to (7,0).\n\nBut wait, after moving to (8,0), I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving into that spot in the same turn. If the enemy moves down to (8,0), then I'd collide. But I don't know where the enemy is moving. Since their last position was (8,1), they might be moving down to (8,0), which would block me. So, perhaps I should check if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving away, but without knowing, I have to be cautious. Maybe moving UP once to (9,1) isn't too bad, but then I'm moving into a spot that's adjacent to the enemy. Not sure if that's better.\n\nWait, let me recheck the board. The enemy is at (8,1), which is the cell up and to the left of me. If I move left once to (8,0), and the enemy moves down to (8,0), we would collide. Therefore, it's possible that the enemy could be moving into (8,0). So, I have to consider that risk.\n\nIs there another direction I can move to avoid that? If I move DOWN from (9,0), I can't because that would go out of the board (y would be -1, which is invalid). So, moving DOWN is impossible. So, my only options are LEFT, UP, or RIGHT (but RIGHT would be into (9,1), which is same as moving UP).\n\nWait, (9,0)'s RIGHT would be into (9,1), but actually, no, moving RIGHT from (9,0) in x-direction isn't possible because x ranges from 0-9, so x=9 is the max. So, moving RIGHT from (9,0) would take me out of the board, causing me to die. So, I cannot move RIGHT.\n\nSo, the available directions are LEFT (to (8,0)) or UP (to (9,1)).\n\nIf I move LEFT, I risk the enemy moving into (8,0) and causing a collision. Alternatively, moving UP to (9,1) is safe because there's no one there as per the board state. Also, moving up might position me better for reaching the apple at (9,7) later.\n\nWait, let's think again. The apple at (7,0) is at y=0, same as my current position. So, if I move left twice, I can get there. But if I move up, I'm moving away from that apple. Maybe it's better to go for (7,0) because it's closer.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,1) is safe, and from there, I can consider moving left to (8,1) but the enemy is there, so that's dangerous. So, perhaps after moving up to (9,1), my next move could be to move left to (8,1), but that's where the enemy is, so that's not allowed unless the enemy moves away.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me try to outline the options:\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (8,0). Potential risk if enemy moves down to (8,0), leading to collision.\n\nOption 2: Move UP to (9,1). Safe, as no one is there.\n\nIf I choose Option 1, I might get the apple at (7,0) next turn, but with some risk of collision. If I choose Option 2, I avoid the risk but don't get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, maybe moving UP to (9,1) is safer, and then I can move LEFT to (8,1) if the enemy isn't there. But that's a risk too. Alternatively, from (9,1), I can then move LEFT to (8,1), which is where the enemy is, so that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, after moving UP to (9,1), I can move LEFT once to (8,1) only if the enemy isn't there anymore. But since I don't know where the enemy is moving, that's a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy is at (8,1). What can they do? They can move in any direction, but since they have no body, perhaps they can go anywhere without dying except into walls or their own body.\n\nIf the enemy moves down to (8,0), that's possible. Then, moving LEFT to (8,0) would collide with them. So, in that case, moving LEFT would be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy could be moving up, right, or left. But without knowing, I have to assume they might move in any direction.\n\nSo, perhaps moving UP to (9,1) is safer because I don't have to go into (8,0). Then, from (9,1), perhaps I can move LEFT to (8,1) if the enemy isn't there, but that's risky because they might be moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is trying to get to an apple as well. The closest apple to them at (8,1) is (7,0), which is nearby. So, maybe the enemy is moving towards that.\n\nBut without knowing, I have to weigh the options. Moving LEFT to (8,0) could be safe if the enemy isn't moving into that spot. But moving UP to (9,1) is definitely safe because there's no one there.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to move UP to (9,1). Then, in the next move, I can evaluate again. Alternatively, if I move UP, I can start moving towards (9,7), which is an apple, but that's 7 steps up. Alternatively, perhaps I can move LEFT from (9,1) to (8,1), but that's where the enemy is. So, that's not a good idea unless the enemy has moved away.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the board again. The board shows:\n\nAt y=0, my snake is at (9,0). Enemy is at (8,1). So, moving up would take me to (9,1), which is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP seems safe. Once at (9,1), I can then consider moving LEFT to (8,1), but only if the enemy isn't there. But that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1), I can continue moving UP towards (9,7). That's a straight line, no obstacles in between, so that seems possible. But that would take 6 more steps upward, and I don't know if the enemy would get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1), I could move LEFT to (8,1), but if the enemy is there, I'd die. So, perhaps that's too risky.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (8,1). So, when I move to (9,1), the enemy is at (8,1), which is to the left of me. So, in the next move, if the enemy moves down to (8,0), that's possible, but maybe they won't. Or they might move left, right, or up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (7,0) despite the risk. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,0), and the enemy moves down to (8,0), we collide and I die. That's a 50% chance, but maybe they don't move there. Maybe I should take the risk because the apple is close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the enemy is trying to go for the apple at (7,0) as well, so they might move towards it.\n\nHmm, it's a tough choice. Let me think about the possible outcomes.\n\nIf I move LEFT:\n\n- If enemy doesn't move to (8,0) in their next move, I'm safe and can proceed to (7,0) next move.\n\n- If enemy does move to (8,0), I die.\n\nIf I move UP:\n\n- I'm safe, but I'm moving away from the closest apple.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP is safer, even if it takes me away from the immediate apple. Then, from (9,1), I can consider moving towards (9,7) or maybe go left to (8,1) if the enemy isn't there anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the positions of the other apples. The apple at (9,7) is on the same x-coordinate as me, so moving up to that would be straightforward if I can get there without being blocked.\n\nSo, moving up to (9,1) is safe. Then, from there, I can keep moving up to (9,2), (9,3), etc., towards (9,7). But that's a longer path, but maybe it's safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,0) is riskier but gives me the apple sooner.\n\nI think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,0). The risk is that the enemy might be moving to (8,0), but it's possible they aren't. Alternatively, perhaps the enemy is moving towards another apple.\n\nAdditionally, if I move LEFT to (8,0), I can then proceed to (7,0) next turn, which is the apple. So, it's two steps, but the first step is potentially risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,1) is safer. Then, in the next move, I can decide whether to move left towards the enemy or continue up.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline the priorities:\n\n1. Stay alive.\n\n2. Collect the closest apple.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (7,0). To get there, I need to move LEFT twice. But the first move, to (8,0), may be risky if the enemy moves into that spot.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's move, I have to make a decision. I think moving LEFT is the way to go because (7,0) is very close. So, I'll proceed.\n\nNext move: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,0), aiming to collect the apple at (7,0) while being cautious of the enemy's possible movement to the same spot.\n\nLEFT"

Alternatively, from (9,1), I can then move LEFT to (8,1), which is where the enemy is, so that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, after moving UP to (9,1), I can move LEFT once to (8,1) only if the enemy isn't there anymore. But since I don't know where the enemy is moving, that's a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy is at (8,1). What can they do? They can move in any direction, but since they have no body, perhaps they can go anywhere without dying except into walls or their own body.\n\nIf the enemy moves down to (8,0), that's possible. Then, moving LEFT to (8,0) would collide with them. So, in that case, moving LEFT would be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy could be moving up, right, or left. But without knowing, I have to assume they might move in any direction.\n\nSo, perhaps moving UP to (9,1) is safer because I don't have to go into (8,0). Then, from (9,1), perhaps I can move LEFT to (8,1) if the enemy isn't there, but that's risky because they might be moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is trying to get to an apple as well. The closest apple to them at (8,1) is (7,0), which is nearby. So, maybe the enemy is moving towards that.\n\nBut without knowing, I have to weigh the options. Moving LEFT to (8,0) could be safe if the enemy isn't moving into that spot. But moving UP to (9,1) is definitely safe because there's no one there.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to move UP to (9,1). Then, in the next move, I can evaluate again. Alternatively, if I move UP, I can start moving towards (9,7), which is an apple, but that's 7 steps up. Alternatively, perhaps I can move LEFT from (9,1) to (8,1), but that's where the enemy is. So, that's not a good idea unless the enemy has moved away.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the board again. The board shows:\n\nAt y=0, my snake is at (9,0). Enemy is at (8,1). So, moving up would take me to (9,1), which is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP seems safe. Once at (9,1), I can then consider moving LEFT to (8,1), but only if the enemy isn't there. But that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1), I can continue moving UP towards (9,7). That's a straight line, no obstacles in between, so that seems possible. But that would take 6 more steps upward, and I don't know if the enemy would get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,1), I could move LEFT to (8,1), but if the enemy is there, I'd die. So, perhaps that's too risky.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (8,1). So, when I move to (9,1), the enemy is at (8,1), which is to the left of me. So, in the next move, if the enemy moves down to (8,0), that's possible, but maybe they won't. Or they might move left, right, or up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (7,0) despite the risk. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,0), and the enemy moves down to (8,0), we collide and I die. That's a 50% chance, but maybe they don't move there. Maybe I should take the risk because the apple is close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the enemy is trying to go for the apple at (7,0) as well, so they might move towards it.\n\nHmm, it's a tough choice. Let me think about the possible outcomes.\n\nIf I move LEFT:\n\n- If enemy doesn't move to (8,0) in their next move, I'm safe and can proceed to (7,0) next move.\n\n- If enemy does move to (8,0), I die.\n\nIf I move UP:\n\n- I'm safe, but I'm moving away from the closest apple.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP is safer, even if it takes me away from the immediate apple. Then, from (9,1), I can consider moving towards (9,7) or maybe go left to (8,1) if the enemy isn't there anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the positions of the other apples. The apple at (9,7) is on the same x-coordinate as me, so moving up to that would be straightforward if I can get there without being blocked.\n\nSo, moving up to (9,1) is safe. Then, from there, I can keep moving up to (9,2), (9,3), etc., towards (9,7). But that's a longer path, but maybe it's safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,0) is riskier but gives me the apple sooner.\n\nI think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,0). The risk is that the enemy might be moving to (8,0), but it's possible they aren't. Alternatively, perhaps the enemy is moving towards another apple.\n\nAdditionally, if I move LEFT to (8,0), I can then proceed to (7,0) next turn, which is the apple. So, it's two steps, but the first step is potentially risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,1) is safer. Then, in the next move, I can decide whether to move left towards the enemy or continue up.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline the priorities:\n\n1. Stay alive.\n\n2. Collect the closest apple.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (7,0). To get there, I need to move LEFT twice. But the first move, to (8,0), may be risky if the enemy moves into that spot.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's move, I have to make a decision. I think moving LEFT is the way to go because (7,0) is very close. So, I'll proceed.\n\nNext move: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,0), aiming to collect the apple at (7,0) while being cautious of the enemy's possible movement to the same spot.\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (8,1).\n\n**Apples Available:**\n1. (2,4)\n2. (7,0)\n3. (4,2)\n4. (9,7)\n5. (6,2)\n\n**Immediate Goal:**\nCollect the closest apple, which is at (7,0). It's just one step to the LEFT from my current position (8,0).\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- Moving LEFT to (7,0) is safe if the enemy doesn't move into that spot. However, the enemy is at (8,1), which is adjacent. If the enemy moves DOWN to (8,0), that would block my path, but since I've already moved to (8,0) in my last turn, the enemy can't be there now because their move would have been processed after mine. Therefore, moving to (7,0) should be safe now.\n\n**Alternative Considerations:**\n- Moving UP to (8,1) would take me directly into the enemy's current position, which would cause a collision and result in death. So, that's not an option.\n- Moving RIGHT back to (9,0) would take me away from the apple and isn't beneficial.\n- Moving DOWN is impossible as it would take me out of the board.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe safest and most rewarding move is to proceed LEFT to collect the apple at (7,0). This will increase my score, and since the enemy is at (8,1), moving to (7,0) doesn't risk collision this turn.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"
