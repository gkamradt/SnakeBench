There are apples at (5, 4), (5, 2), (3, 1), (8, 6), (6, 5). The closest one appears to be at (6, 5). Snake #2 is at (4, 4). I need to avoid the enemy snake and my body.\n\nIf I move right, I will move to (5, 6).\nIf I move up, I will move to (4, 7).\nIf I move down, I will move to (4, 5).\nIf I move left, I will move to (3, 6), which is my body, so I can't move left.\n\nMoving right to (5, 6) is a good option because it is not blocked. It helps me approach the apple at (6, 5).\n\nMy plan is:\nMove: RIGHT\nNext move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "Analyzing the current situation, my snake is positioned at (4, 4) after my last move. The body of my snake is at (4, 5). Here\u2019s a breakdown of my next potential moves based on my current coordinates:\n\n1. **Current Position**: I am at (4, 4) with the head of the snake. My body at (4, 5) restricts my movements somewhat.\n  \n2. **Apples**: The nearest apples are:\n   - (5, 4): Directly above me, I can eat this apple by moving UP.\n   - (5, 2), (3, 1), (8, 6): Further away and not my immediate concern.\n\n3. **Move Options**:\n   - **UP to (5, 4)**: This space is occupied by an apple, which is a beneficial move because I will grow my snake and gain a point. This is the best move available.\n   - **DOWN to (4, 3)**: This is a valid move, but doesn't lead to an apple.\n   - **LEFT to (3, 4)**: Also doesn't lead to an apple.\n   - **RIGHT to (5, 4)**: Again, this is the same space as above, which is occupied by the apple.\n\n4. **Strategic Move**: Given that moving UP to (5, 4) will allow me to collect an apple, it is clearly the optimal move. Not only will I gain a point, but my tail will potentially shift and allow more options for subsequent moves.\n\n5. **Body Restriction**: After this move, my new position will be (5, 4) and my body will be updated to reflect that.\n\nNext turns will focus on positioning and preparing to eat another apple, considering the proximity of apples and possible enemy movements.\n\nDecided next move: UP."
