An apple lies straight ahead at (9, 9), which would require a continuation of the current trajectory RIGHT to gather it, maximizing efficiency and score. However, since a turn cannot be skipped, and moving endlessly RIGHT would eventually lead to collision with the boundary, post-apple collection at (9, 9), a directional change will become mandatory.\n\nConsidering other apples' locations, the nearest reachable apple following the one at (9, 9) is at (8, 6). Therefore, after moving RIGHT this turn and consuming the top-right corner apple, the logical subsequent move would be to head DOWN to position the snake for the next apple. This path would entail a directional shift to DOWN for three consecutive turns without risks of self-collision or running into boundaries.\n\nEnemy snake #2 positioned at (3, 1) is currently distant and solely located far across the board with no body, suggesting minimal immediate collision risk. This tranquility provides an advantageous span for focusing on apple collection and strategic positioning on the board.\n\nPlan Summary:\n1. Move RIGHT this turn to consume the apple at (9, 9).\n2. Change direction to DOWN the following turn aiming for the apple at (8, 6).\n3. Keep an eye on the movement of Snake #2 for any sudden changes or threats and adjust the strategy accordingly.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

Since I am currently at the edge of the board at (9, 9), I cannot continue RIGHT but need to start moving DOWN to aim for the next closest apple.\n\nFor future moves:\n1. This turn, maneuver DOWN to start the approach to the apple located at (8, 6).\n2. Continue moving DOWN to eventually adjust the x-coordinate when directly aligned with (8, 6).\n3. Observe Snake #2 for potential threat interactions or opportunities, particularly if it moves towards a less crowded area of the board or near the apples at the bottom.
