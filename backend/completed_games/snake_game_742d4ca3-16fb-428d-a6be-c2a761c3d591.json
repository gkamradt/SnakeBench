Approaching these apples does not present an immediate threat from the enemy snake #2, whose closest body part is behind and to the left at (7, 6).\n\n3. **Strategic Objectives**:\n   - The primary strategy remains to gather the apples at (9, 3) and (9, 2) by moving DOWN consecutively. This reduces the distance to these targets and utilizes the current strategic position at the far right edge, minimizing potential interaction with the enemy snake.\n\n4. **Considerations for Future Moves**:\n   - After collecting the apples at (9, 3) and (9, 2), consider turning UP to potentially aim for the apple at (3, 9) which will require navigating across the board. Adjust planning with respect to enemy snake's movements and positions of other apples.\n   \n**Decided Next Move**:\n- **DOWN** to approach the nearest apples efficiently and minimize risk."

Review of Options from Current Position:\n   - Move UP to (9, 9): This makes sense only if there's an apple in that position, which is not the case. Hence, it's not beneficial now.\n   - Move DOWN to (9, 7): This move positions the snake closer to the apples at coordinates (9, 3) and (9, 2). These are within reach given consecutive downward moves after this.\n   - Move LEFT to (8, 8): This would take the snake away from the side containing more apples (right side 9-th column). This doesn't maximize the potential of gathering apples quickly.\n   - Move RIGHT to (10, 8): This move is impossible as it goes beyond the board limits, causing death.\n\n2. Consideration of Nearby Threats:\n   - Enemy Snake #2 is positioned at (7, 6). Current direction down or up doesn't directly conflict with this threat. However, substantial movement leftward could increase risk of nearing the enemy snake depending on its movement.\n\n3. Strategic Objective:\n   - The goal is evidently to gather the two nearby apples at coordinates (9, 2) and (9, 3). Moving DOWN repeatedly after this turn will lead directly to these apples, effectively enhancing points and snake size without directly courting danger.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\n- Assuming successful collection of apples (9, 3) and (9, 2), reassess the board, particularly for enemy snake movements. If further path clearing persists downwards without threat, maintain the course or potentially alter to left/right based on available apples' positions across the board.\n\nDecided Next Move:\n- DOWN"

Approaching these apples does not present an immediate threat from the enemy snake #2, whose closest body part is behind and to the left at (7, 6).\n\n3. **Strategic Objectives**:\n   - The primary strategy remains to gather the apples at (9, 3) and (9, 2) by moving DOWN consecutively. This reduces the distance to these targets and utilizes the current strategic position at the far right edge, minimizing potential interaction with the enemy snake.\n\n4. **Considerations for Future Moves**:\n   - After collecting the apples at (9, 3) and (9, 2), consider turning UP to potentially aim for the apple at (3, 9) which will require navigating across the board. Adjust planning with respect to enemy snake's movements and positions of other apples.\n   \n**Decided Next Move**:\n- **DOWN** to approach the nearest apples efficiently and minimize risk."
