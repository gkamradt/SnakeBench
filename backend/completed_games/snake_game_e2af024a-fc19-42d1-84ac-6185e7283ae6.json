Since moving back upward (which would be our previous cell) counts as going backwards and isn\u2019t allowed, we need to choose between LEFT and DOWN. \n\nIf we move LEFT, we go from (3,4) to (2,4). That directly sets our x-coordinate to 2\u2014the same as our apple\u2019s x\u2014and from there we can plan to move down along column 2 toward (2,1). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (3,3) would be equally safe but then we\u2019d have to later move left. \n\nGiven that (2,4) is a free, safe cell and it positions us closer horizontally to the apple, my strategy is to head LEFT. \n\nNext move: LEFT."

The closest apple is at (8, 7), which is directly above my current position. I'll evaluate this option first.\n\n3. **Possible Moves Analysis:**\n   - **UP:** Moving to (8, 6) will bring me one step closer to the apple at (8, 7). This move helps progress toward collecting the nearest apple and is safe, as no walls or opponents are in this immediate path.\n   - **DOWN:** Moving to (8, 4) seems counterproductive as it moves away from the nearest apple target.\n   - **LEFT:** Moving to (7, 5) does not bring me closer to any apple and will divert my path unnecessarily.\n   - **RIGHT:** Not preferred since it would take me back to the previous position, not advancing my goal toward apples. Also, it\u2019s the direction we just moved away from.\n\n4. **Target Apple:**\n   - The apple at (8, 7) remains the best target at this time. Moving UP aligns with this goal and is a logical step in advancing toward this apple in subsequent turns.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations:**\n   - Moving UP is safe as there are no snakes or walls directly in the intended path. I will also remain aware of any movement from Snake #2, although it is currently not nearby.\n\n6. **Strategy for Next Turns:**\n   - Continue monitoring the locations and movements of the opponent snake and avoid the edges of the board where possible to prevent getting cornered. Adjust strategy based on the opponent's moves and location of new apples that may come into play.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving UP to (8, 6) keeps my snake safe and in a direct path toward the closest apple at (8, 7). This move sets me up well for capturing the apple in a future turn.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP"

Since (3,4) is lower than (2,6), dropping down helps align us vertically sooner. There are no obstacles in the (2,5) cell, and the enemy snake at (6,6) is safely away.\n\nThus, our strategy is to move DOWN, then plan to adjust horizontally (to the RIGHT) on future moves if needed to complete our approach to the apple at (3,4).\n\nNext move: DOWN."
