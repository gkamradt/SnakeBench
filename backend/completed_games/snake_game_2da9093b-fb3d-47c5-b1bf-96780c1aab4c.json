Now that I've collected that apple, I will be larger, and I've gained 1 point. My new position is (3, 6).\n\nNext, let\u2019s evaluate my current position (3, 6) to determine my options:\n\n1. **UP (3, 7)**: This position is empty, but it doesn\u2019t lead directly to an apple.\n2. **DOWN (3, 5)**: This position is empty, and I would not be getting closer to any apples.\n3. **LEFT (2, 6)**: This is my last position, which isn't a good move since it takes me back.\n4. **RIGHT (4, 6)**: This position is currently empty but keeps me moving to the right. However, there are no apples directly to the right or near this position.\n\nCurrently, there are apples at:\n- (4, 7) \n- (8, 0) \n- (8, 8) \n- (0, 4) \n- (6, 5)\n\nOut of all the directions, UP and RIGHT are reasonable to move towards, but since I can't collect an apple going straight these ways, I will look for positioning for my next moves.\n\nSince moving LEFT is not ideal, and DOWN also has no immediate benefits, I see that the best option is to go **UP (3, 7)**\u2014it allows me to potentially access the apple at (4, 7) next turn depending on where the enemy snake moves.\n\nMy strategy moving forward will be to prioritize surrounding apples while keeping distance from the enemy snake. I'll have to be careful not to block myself off or end up in a position where I cannot make a safe move.\n\nSo, for this turn, I choose to move: UP."

After my next move, depending on the snake movement, I want to make sure that I can continue towards that apple.\n\nNow let\u2019s break down the next possible moves:\n\n1. If I move **DOWN to (5, 6)**:\n   - My next potential moves would be:\n     - **UP (5, 7)** (invalid, return to previous position)\n     - **DOWN (5, 5)** (empty)\n     - **LEFT (4, 6)** (empty)\n     - **RIGHT (6, 6)** (empty)\n\n2. If I move **RIGHT to (6, 7)**:\n   - My next potential moves would be:\n     - **UP (6, 8)** (empty)\n     - **DOWN (6, 6)** (empty)\n     - **LEFT (5, 7)** (invalid, return to previous position)\n     - **RIGHT (7, 7)** (empty)\n\nConsidering that the apple at (6, 5) is below my current position, moving DOWN first would be the most direct route towards the apple. While I can also find alternatives like moving RIGHT, that would lengthen my path and provide extra steps before I can make a downward move.\n\nGiven that moving DOWN doesn't come with immediate threats since the enemy snake (2) is not in this area based on known positions, I will proceed.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: DOWN."

This is the best option.\n- **LEFT (5, 6)**: This position is where I just came from, which means it's not a valid move as I would be reversing direction.\n- **RIGHT (7, 6)**: This position is empty, but again, it does not help in achieving the goal of gaining points.\n\nBased on this analysis, my strategy is clear: I should prioritize gaining points by moving to (6, 5) where the apple is located. This will also position me better for potentially reaching other apples in the next moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n1. Move down to (6, 5), eat the apple, grow my snake, and gain an additional point.\n2. After eating the apple, I should reassess any potential new positions for the next turn and look for the nearest apple.\n\nDecided next move: **DOWN**."

            "rationale": "Thinking out loud: After my last move, I am now at (3, 6) and have gained a point by eating the apple at (3, 5). I am closer to the apple at (2, 6), but moving towards it would bring me closer to enemy snake #1, which is currently at (2, 7) with its body at [(1, 7), (1, 6)]. If I move towards the apple at (2, 6), I will be moving closer to snake #1. However, I am currently one step ahead of it, so I can potentially outmaneuver it by moving diagonally or quickly eating the apple and moving away.\n\nOn the other hand, the apple at (6, 5) is not too far, and it could be a good long-term strategy to move towards it. However, moving towards it now would mean moving away from the apple at (2, 6) and potentially losing the opportunity to eat it.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I will move towards the apple at (2, 6) to potentially gain another point. This move will also keep me away from the apple at (6, 5) for now, allowing me to potentially move towards it later. If I move diagonally, I might be able to avoid snake #1 altogether.\n\nIf I move diagonally right up, I will be moving towards the apple at (2, 6) while also keeping me one step ahead of snake #1. If I move diagonally, I might be able to avoid snake #1 altogether.\n\nNext move: DIAGONAL RIGHT UP. This move will take me towards the apple at (2, 6) while also keeping me one step ahead of snake #1. If I move diagonally, I might be able to avoid snake #1 altogether.\n\nUP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT: DIAGONAL RIGHT UP."
