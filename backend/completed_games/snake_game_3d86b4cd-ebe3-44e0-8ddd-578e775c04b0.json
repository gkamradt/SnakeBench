I should prioritize moving towards these apples to increase my score.\n\nHowever, I also need to be cautious of Snake #2, which is at (8, 9). If I move too close to it, I risk colliding with it and losing points.\n\nConsidering my current position and the available apples, my next move should be to move towards the apple at (5, 8). This will allow me to collect the apple and potentially gain more points.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I will try to move towards the apple at (5, 8) while keeping an eye on Snake #2 to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Moving right would allow me to eat the apple at (9, 9) next turn, but it would also bring me closer to snake #1. Moving up would allow me to eat the apple at (8, 8) next turn, but it would also bring me closer to the wall.\n\nGiven that I'm currently at the top of the board, it might be safer to move up and eat the apple at (8, 8) next turn, then decide on a strategy to avoid snake #1 and continue moving towards other apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to avoid snake #1 and move towards the apples at (6, 5) and (5, 6).\n\nNext move: UP"
