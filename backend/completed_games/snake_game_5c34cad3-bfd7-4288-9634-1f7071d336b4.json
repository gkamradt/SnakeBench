The closest apple to my current position at (8, 3) is at (7, 3), which is directly to my left. However, moving left would put me in a position where I have limited escape routes if the enemy snake at (5, 4) decides to move towards me.\n\nTherefore, I will prioritize safety and aim for the apple at (5, 8) as it is still a relatively close target and moving towards it will maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake. The enemy snake's possible moves are limited since it's close to the bottom edge of the board, which means it cannot move down without dying.\n\nTo reach the apple at (5, 8), I should move up to (8, 2), then continue moving left to align with the apple's y-coordinate, and finally move up to collect the apple. This route minimizes the risk of being blocked by the enemy snake, as it would have to move up three times to reach the same row as the apple at (5, 8), which is unlikely given its current position and the fact that it would be moving towards my snake.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's potential moves, it is less likely to move left or right since those directions do not lead to any apples. It might consider moving up towards the apple at (5, 8), but it would take several moves for it to reach that apple, during which time I can adjust my path accordingly.\n\nBased on this analysis, my next move should be:\n\nUP to position (8, 2).\n\nAs a strategy for the next turn, I will continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust my path to avoid any potential collisions. If the enemy snake moves up, I may need to move left earlier than planned to avoid a collision. If it moves right or stays in place, I can continue moving up to collect the apple at (5, 8)."

However, I must ensure that the enemy snake, Snake #1, which is currently at (5, 8) and moving upwards, does not pose a threat to my next move.\n\nIf Snake #1 continues to move upwards, it will be two moves away from reaching the apple at (7, 0) and will then likely change direction. Given that Snake #1's body segment is at (5, 7), it is unlikely that it will move left immediately after collecting the apple because it would risk colliding with its own body. Therefore, Snake #1 is expected to move either up or right after reaching (7, 0).\n\nTo ensure safety, I should move up to collect the apple at (7, 9) before Snake #1 has a chance to move up again after reaching (7, 0). This will give me the maximum distance from Snake #1 and secure the apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (7, 9), I will have to reassess the situation. The next closest apple is at (4, 5), but moving towards it immediately would put me in potential danger of colliding with Snake #1, depending on its next move.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be:\n\nUP to position (8, 8) to collect the apple at (7, 9) on the subsequent turn.\n\nI will also need to be prepared for my next move after collecting the apple.

After moving up to collect the apple at (7, 9), I need to consider my next move carefully.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #1, is currently at (6, 8) and moving upwards. It is two moves away from the apple at (7, 0). After collecting that apple, Snake #1 is likely to move either up or right, as moving left would cause it to collide with its own body. Therefore, I should avoid moving into a position where Snake #1 could potentially corner me or cut off my path after it collects the apple at (7, 0).\n\nThe next closest apple is at (4, 5), but moving towards it immediately is risky because it would bring me close to Snake #1's potential path. Instead, I should consider moving towards the apples at (7, 7) or (7, 3) after collecting the apple at (7, 9). These apples are in a straight line with my current trajectory, and moving towards them would keep me at a safe distance from Snake #1.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (7, 9), I will have the option to move either left or down on my next turn. Moving left would position me to collect the apple at (7, 7) on the subsequent turn, while moving down would allow me to collect the apple at (7, 3) after that.
