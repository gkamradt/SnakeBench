It doesn't lead to an apple but places me one step closer vertically. The Y-coordinate increases, keeping in mind we may reach apples higher up.\n  \n2. **DOWN (3,0):** This is out of bounds of permissible play because anything below Y=0 is invalid.\n\n3. **LEFT (2,1):** This square is empty but doesn't further my goal of collecting apples immediately; I wouldn\u2019t hit an apple moving in this direction.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4,1):** This square is occupied by an apple! Moving here will allow me to collect it and grow.\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n- The most immediate benefit is to move RIGHT to (4, 1) where I can collect an apple.\n- This also puts me in a better position to evaluate further moves in subsequent turns. After this apple, I can plan around the positions of both myself and the enemy snake.\n\n### Concern for Enemy:\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 1) keeps distance from Snake #2 at (4, 3). My Y-coordinate would remain lower, so I'm technically safe from running into its close vicinity this turn.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering all these factors, my next move is clear.

It doesn't lead to an apple but places me one step closer vertically. The Y-coordinate increases, keeping in mind we may reach apples higher up.\n  \n2. **DOWN (3,0):** This is out of bounds of permissible play because anything below Y=0 is invalid.\n\n3. **LEFT (2,1):** This square is empty but doesn't further my goal of collecting apples immediately; I wouldn\u2019t hit an apple moving in this direction.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4,1):** This square is occupied by an apple! Moving here will allow me to collect it and grow.\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n- The most immediate benefit is to move RIGHT to (4, 1) where I can collect an apple.\n- This also puts me in a better position to evaluate further moves in subsequent turns. After this apple, I can plan around the positions of both myself and the enemy snake.\n\n### Concern for Enemy:\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 1) keeps distance from Snake #2 at (4, 3). My Y-coordinate would remain lower, so I'm technically safe from running into its close vicinity this turn.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering all these factors, my next move is clear.

It doesn't lead to an apple but places me one step closer vertically. The Y-coordinate increases, keeping in mind we may reach apples higher up.\n  \n2. **DOWN (3,0):** This is out of bounds of permissible play because anything below Y=0 is invalid.\n\n3. **LEFT (2,1):** This square is empty but doesn't further my goal of collecting apples immediately; I wouldn\u2019t hit an apple moving in this direction.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4,1):** This square is occupied by an apple! Moving here will allow me to collect it and grow.\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n- The most immediate benefit is to move RIGHT to (4, 1) where I can collect an apple.\n- This also puts me in a better position to evaluate further moves in subsequent turns. After this apple, I can plan around the positions of both myself and the enemy snake.\n\n### Concern for Enemy:\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 1) keeps distance from Snake #2 at (4, 3). My Y-coordinate would remain lower, so I'm technically safe from running into its close vicinity this turn.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering all these factors, my next move is clear. I will move to the apple at (4, 1) because it allows me to grow and potentially avoids confrontation with the enemy snake at (4, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"

It doesn't lead to an apple but places me one step closer vertically. The Y-coordinate increases, keeping in mind we may reach apples higher up.\n  \n2. **DOWN (3,0):** This is out of bounds of permissible play because anything below Y=0 is invalid.\n\n3. **LEFT (2,1):** This square is empty but doesn't further my goal of collecting apples immediately; I wouldn\u2019t hit an apple moving in this direction.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4,1):** This square is occupied by an apple! Moving here will allow me to collect it and grow.\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n- The most immediate benefit is to move RIGHT to (4, 1) where I can collect an apple.\n- This also puts me in a better position to evaluate further moves in subsequent turns. After this apple, I can plan around the positions of both myself and the enemy snake.\n\n### Concern for Enemy:\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 1) keeps distance from Snake #2 at (4, 3). My Y-coordinate would remain lower, so I'm technically safe from running into its close vicinity this turn.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering all these factors, my next move is clear.
