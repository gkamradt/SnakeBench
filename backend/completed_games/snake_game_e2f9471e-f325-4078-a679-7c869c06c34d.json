However, it doesn't help me collect any apples.\n\nMoving left would take me to (4, 9), where there's no apple but also no other snakes or walls.\n\nMoving right would take me to (6, 9), where there's an apple. However, this move would put me closer to snake #1, which might be a risk if it starts moving towards me.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions, I'll prioritize moving towards the apples.
