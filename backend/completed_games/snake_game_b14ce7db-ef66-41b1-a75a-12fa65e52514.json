The enemy is fairly far away from my position at (5, 2), so I have room to maneuver and pursue apples without immediate threats.\n\n### Possible Moves from (5, 2):\n1. **UP to (5, 3)**: Will not affect my goal immediately, but I need to keep track of my new length as the head position.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 1)**: This would mean going back and doesn't help in gathering another apple.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 2)**: There\u2019s no apple here, nor am I making progress toward the remaining apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 2)**: This still won\u2019t fetch any fruit, and it goes sideways.\n\n### Evaluation:\nThe **most strategic move now** is UP to (5, 3) since it keeps me positioned well towards the remaining apples, particularly (5, 6) which is still two moves away. Moving UP seems prudent since it progresses my position towards apple concentration.\n\n### Next Strategy:\n- As I continue to grow, I\u2019ll need to keep enemy snakes and walls in mind while focusing on maximizing my apple collection.\n- I'll plan to seek out the apple at (5, 6) next after making this move.\n\n**Next move: UP.**"

Moving UP seems prudent since it progresses my position towards apple concentration.\n\n### Next Strategy:\n- As I continue to grow, I\u2019ll need to keep enemy snakes and walls in mind while focusing on maximizing my apple collection.\n- I'll plan to seek out the apple at (5, 6) next after making this move.\n\n**Next move: UP.**"
