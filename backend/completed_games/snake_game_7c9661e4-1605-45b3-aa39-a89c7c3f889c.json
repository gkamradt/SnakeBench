Moving left first mitigates this risk.\n* **Future Turn Strategy Reminder**:\n\t- After securing the apple at (5, 3), reassess the board for the next optimal apple, considering both distance and risk factors associated with Snake #1's movements.\n\t- Be prepared to adjust direction swiftly if Snake #1 shows signs of competing for the same resources.\n\n**Decided Next Move**:\nLEFT\n\n(This move prioritizes safe alignment with the nearest apple at (5, 3), minimizing potential conflict with Snake #1.)"
