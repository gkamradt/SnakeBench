            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #2 in this game, and I need to figure out where to move next. Let me start by looking at the current board state. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nMy snake is at (7,6). I need to check where the apples are and where the enemy snake is. The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), and (3,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (8,0), and the board shows that my position is near the middle of the board.\n\nI should list the apples and my position to visualize better. My snake is at (7,6). The closest apples to me seem to be at (5,6) and (4,2), (3,2). But wait, (5,6) is right next to me, just one step to the west. Hmm, that's very close. The other apples are further away, but maybe I should check if moving towards any of them is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see that in row 6, column 5, there's an apple. Since my current position is (7,6), moving left to column 6 would take me to (6,6), which isn't an apple. Wait, actually, looking back, the board shows that at row 6, column 5 is an apple, but wait, the coordinates are (x,y). So (5,6) is the apple, right? Because in the board, it's represented as row 6, column 5. So yes, (5,6) is the position.\n\nSo from (7,6), if I move left, I can go to (6,6), then to (5,6) to get that apple. That seems promising because it's very close. Alternatively, moving up would take me to (7,7), which doesn't have an apple, but moving down to (7,5) also doesn't have an apple.\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions. From the problem statement: Apples at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), (3,5). So (5,6) is indeed there. That's right next to me. So moving left twice would get me to that apple.\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any obstacles or if moving that way would cause me to collide with myself or the wall.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is only at (7,6). I don't have any body parts listed, so I assume it's just the head. So moving left to (6,6) and then to (5,6) should be possible without hitting anything unless enemy snake or another part is there. Enemy snake is at (8,0), which is far away near the bottom right corner.\n\nSo the plan is to move left towards (5,6) to get that apple, which would make me grow and gain a point.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other closer apples or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,1) is far away on the bottom left. (3,2) and (4,2) are also on the lower part of the board, which would require me to move down a lot, which might not be the best move right now.\n\nSo the closest and safest move is to go left towards (5,6). Therefore, my next move should be LEFT.\n\nI should also consider the direction. Moving left decreases the x-coordinate, so from (7,6) to (6,6). That's correct.\n\nWait, but before moving, I should ensure that moving left is possible. My snake's head is at (7,6). If I move left, I'll be at (6,6). Are there any obstacles there? Looking at the board, the only other thing in row 6 is the apple at (5,6). So (6,6) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose another direction, I could check up, down, or right, but those don't seem as beneficial. Moving right would take me to (8,6), which is empty, but there's no apple there. Moving up would take me to (7,7), which is empty. Moving down would take me to (7,5), which is also empty. So LEFT is the best move.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is at (8,0). It's far away, so I don't have to worry about it right now. My priority is to collect the nearby apple to gain points and grow.\n\nSo, to sum up, the next move should be LEFT to move towards the apple at (5,6). That way, in the next step, I can collect the apple and possibly have more options afterward.\n</think>\n\nI should move left to collect the apple at (5,6), as it's the closest and safest option. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 2 in this game. My current position is (5,6). I just moved left, and my last rationale was about collecting the nearest apple safely. Let me look at the board state again.\n\nThe apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), and (3,4). So, looking at the board, let me plot these points. I'm at (5,6), which is on the right side of the board, around the middle. \n\nLast move I went left to (5,6) from (6,6), so my next move is supposed to be left again. Wait, but if I go left from (5,6), I'll end up at (4,6). Let me check what's there. Looking at the board state, at y=6, the only thing is snake 2 at (5,6). So (4,6) is empty. Is that a safe move?\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,2). That's far away from me, so for now, maybe I don't have to worry about it. My main concern is avoiding walls and myself. Since I was moving left, my body is behind me. I need to make sure I don't turn into myself.\n\nSo, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) seems possible. But what's my next goal? The nearest apple. Looking at the list, the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), (3,4). So let's calculate the distance from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,6), the distance to each apple:\n\n- (4,2): That's 1 left and 4 down. So distance is 5.\n- (3,2): 2 left and 4 down, distance 6.\n- (0,1): 5 left and 5 down, distance 10.\n- (3,5): 2 left and 1 down, distance 3.\n- (3,4): 2 left and 2 down, distance 4.\n\nSo the nearest apple is (3,5), which is 3 units away. Then (3,4) is 4 units, (4,2) is 5 units, etc.\n\nSo I should aim for (3,5) or (3,4). Let's see. From (5,6), to get to (3,5), I can go left twice and down once. Or, perhaps, take a different path.\n\nWait, but if I move left again, I'll be at (4,6), which is one step closer. Then from there, I can decide the next moves. Alternatively, maybe moving up or down first would be better.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (5,6) to (4,6) is fine. Now, from (4,6), what's next? To get to (3,5), I can go left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5). Or from (4,6), go down to (4,5), then left twice to (3,4), but that's a different apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,5) is at y=5, so one down from (3,6). So perhaps from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5) would be ideal. Alternatively, from (5,6), maybe going down first would be better.\n\nWait, if I'm at (5,6), moving down would take me to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then left again to (3,5), which is an apple. That's a possible path. Alternatively, going left first to (4,6), then down twice to (4,4), then left to (3,4), which is another apple.\n\nHmm, so which path is safer? Let's check the board for obstacles. There's an enemy snake at (8,2), which is far away. My own body, since I just moved left, my previous position was (6,6), so I don't have a long body yet. So moving left then down should be safe.\n\nSo, my current position is (5,6). Next move is to go left to (4,6). Then, from there, I can go left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move left from (5,6) to (4,6), that's one step. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) is another step. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) to collect the apple. That would be three moves in total to reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I first go down to (5,5), then left twice to (3,5). That would also take three moves.\n\nWhich is better? Let me think about potential obstacles. From (5,6), going down to (5,5) seems safe because there's nothing there. Then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). That would get me to the apple in three steps.\n\nBut perhaps the path going left first allows me to approach from the top, which might be safer, but I don't see any enemies nearby.\n\nWait, also, there's an apple at (3,4), which is just below (3,5). So after collecting (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) for another apple. That would be a good plan.\n\nBut first, I need to get to (3,5). So, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6), then left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5). That's one way.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). Both paths are similar in steps.\n\nI think either way is fine. Since my last move was LEFT, and I intended to collect the nearest apple safely, I should continue in that direction.\n\nBut wait, the next move is LEFT, as per my last move information. So, I can't change direction yet because I decided to go left again. So from (5,6), the next move is LEFT to (4,6). Then, from there, I can decide whether to go left again or down.\n\nBut perhaps moving left again from (4,6) to (3,6) is possible, and then down to (3,5) for the apple. So my next move would be LEFT.\n\nWait, but if I go left from (5,6) to (4,6), then perhaps the next move should be LEFT again to (3,6), but is that possible? Or is there a wall or something?\n\nLooking at the board state, the point (3,6) is empty. So yes, it's safe to move there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving down first. But I think sticking to the left movement for now is better to reach the apple at (3,5).\n\nSo, my next move will be LEFT to (4,6). Then, in the following move, I'll go LEFT again to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5) to collect the apple.\n\nBut wait, what's the board look like? Let me visualize it again.\n\nAt y=6, the positions are:\n\n(5,6) is me.\n\nNow, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6). That's clear. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6). That's also clear. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) where the apple is.\n\nSo, that's a solid plan. I don't see any immediate threats, so this path should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with moving LEFT again to (4,6).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #2 in this game, and I need to figure out where to move next. Let me start by looking at the current board state. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nMy snake is at (7,6). I need to check where the apples are and where the enemy snake is. The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), and (3,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (8,0), and the board shows that my position is near the middle of the board.\n\nI should list the apples and my position to visualize better. My snake is at (7,6). The closest apples to me seem to be at (5,6) and (4,2), (3,2). But wait, (5,6) is right next to me, just one step to the west. Hmm, that's very close. The other apples are further away, but maybe I should check if moving towards any of them is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see that in row 6, column 5, there's an apple. Since my current position is (7,6), moving left to column 6 would take me to (6,6), which isn't an apple. Wait, actually, looking back, the board shows that at row 6, column 5 is an apple, but wait, the coordinates are (x,y). So (5,6) is the apple, right? Because in the board, it's represented as row 6, column 5. So yes, (5,6) is the position.\n\nSo from (7,6), if I move left, I can go to (6,6), then to (5,6) to get that apple. That seems promising because it's very close. Alternatively, moving up would take me to (7,7), which doesn't have an apple, but moving down to (7,5) also doesn't have an apple.\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions. From the problem statement: Apples at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), (3,5). So (5,6) is indeed there. That's right next to me. So moving left twice would get me to that apple.\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any obstacles or if moving that way would cause me to collide with myself or the wall.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is only at (7,6). I don't have any body parts listed, so I assume it's just the head. So moving left to (6,6) and then to (5,6) should be possible without hitting anything unless enemy snake or another part is there. Enemy snake is at (8,0), which is far away near the bottom right corner.\n\nSo the plan is to move left towards (5,6) to get that apple, which would make me grow and gain a point.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other closer apples or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,1) is far away on the bottom left. (3,2) and (4,2) are also on the lower part of the board, which would require me to move down a lot, which might not be the best move right now.\n\nSo the closest and safest move is to go left towards (5,6). Therefore, my next move should be LEFT.\n\nI should also consider the direction. Moving left decreases the x-coordinate, so from (7,6) to (6,6). That's correct.\n\nWait, but before moving, I should ensure that moving left is possible. My snake's head is at (7,6). If I move left, I'll be at (6,6). Are there any obstacles there? Looking at the board, the only other thing in row 6 is the apple at (5,6). So (6,6) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose another direction, I could check up, down, or right, but those don't seem as beneficial. Moving right would take me to (8,6), which is empty, but there's no apple there. Moving up would take me to (7,7), which is empty. Moving down would take me to (7,5), which is also empty. So LEFT is the best move.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is at (8,0). It's far away, so I don't have to worry about it right now. My priority is to collect the nearby apple to gain points and grow.\n\nSo, to sum up, the next move should be LEFT to move towards the apple at (5,6). That way, in the next step, I can collect the apple and possibly have more options afterward.\n</think>\n\nI should move left to collect the apple at (5,6), as it's the closest and safest option. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #2 in this game, and I need to figure out where to move next. Let me start by looking at the current board state. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nMy snake is at (7,6). I need to check where the apples are and where the enemy snake is. The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), and (3,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (8,0), and the board shows that my position is near the middle of the board.\n\nI should list the apples and my position to visualize better. My snake is at (7,6). The closest apples to me seem to be at (5,6) and (4,2), (3,2). But wait, (5,6) is right next to me, just one step to the west. Hmm, that's very close. The other apples are further away, but maybe I should check if moving towards any of them is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see that in row 6, column 5, there's an apple. Since my current position is (7,6), moving left to column 6 would take me to (6,6), which isn't an apple. Wait, actually, looking back, the board shows that at row 6, column 5 is an apple, but wait, the coordinates are (x,y). So (5,6) is the apple, right? Because in the board, it's represented as row 6, column 5. So yes, (5,6) is the position.\n\nSo from (7,6), if I move left, I can go to (6,6), then to (5,6) to get that apple. That seems promising because it's very close. Alternatively, moving up would take me to (7,7), which doesn't have an apple, but moving down to (7,5) also doesn't have an apple.\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions. From the problem statement: Apples at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), (3,5). So (5,6) is indeed there. That's right next to me. So moving left twice would get me to that apple.\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any obstacles or if moving that way would cause me to collide with myself or the wall.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is only at (7,6). I don't have any body parts listed, so I assume it's just the head. So moving left to (6,6) and then to (5,6) should be possible without hitting anything unless enemy snake or another part is there. Enemy snake is at (8,0), which is far away near the bottom right corner.\n\nSo the plan is to move left towards (5,6) to get that apple, which would make me grow and gain a point.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other closer apples or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,1) is far away on the bottom left. (3,2) and (4,2) are also on the lower part of the board, which would require me to move down a lot, which might not be the best move right now.\n\nSo the closest and safest move is to go left towards (5,6). Therefore, my next move should be LEFT.\n\nI should also consider the direction. Moving left decreases the x-coordinate, so from (7,6) to (6,6). That's correct.\n\nWait, but before moving, I should ensure that moving left is possible. My snake's head is at (7,6). If I move left, I'll be at (6,6). Are there any obstacles there? Looking at the board, the only other thing in row 6 is the apple at (5,6). So (6,6) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose another direction, I could check up, down, or right, but those don't seem as beneficial. Moving right would take me to (8,6), which is empty, but there's no apple there. Moving up would take me to (7,7), which is empty. Moving down would take me to (7,5), which is also empty. So LEFT is the best move.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is at (8,0). It's far away, so I don't have to worry about it right now. My priority is to collect the nearby apple to gain points and grow.\n\nSo, to sum up, the next move should be LEFT to move towards the apple at (5,6). That way, in the next step, I can collect the apple and possibly have more options afterward.\n</think>\n\nI should move left to collect the apple at (5,6), as it's the closest and safest option. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 2 in this game. My current position is (5,6). I just moved left, and my last rationale was about collecting the nearest apple safely. Let me look at the board state again.\n\nThe apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), and (3,4). So, looking at the board, let me plot these points. I'm at (5,6), which is on the right side of the board, around the middle. \n\nLast move I went left to (5,6) from (6,6), so my next move is supposed to be left again. Wait, but if I go left from (5,6), I'll end up at (4,6). Let me check what's there. Looking at the board state, at y=6, the only thing is snake 2 at (5,6). So (4,6) is empty. Is that a safe move?\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,2). That's far away from me, so for now, maybe I don't have to worry about it. My main concern is avoiding walls and myself. Since I was moving left, my body is behind me. I need to make sure I don't turn into myself.\n\nSo, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) seems possible. But what's my next goal? The nearest apple. Looking at the list, the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), (3,4). So let's calculate the distance from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,6), the distance to each apple:\n\n- (4,2): That's 1 left and 4 down. So distance is 5.\n- (3,2): 2 left and 4 down, distance 6.\n- (0,1): 5 left and 5 down, distance 10.\n- (3,5): 2 left and 1 down, distance 3.\n- (3,4): 2 left and 2 down, distance 4.\n\nSo the nearest apple is (3,5), which is 3 units away. Then (3,4) is 4 units, (4,2) is 5 units, etc.\n\nSo I should aim for (3,5) or (3,4). Let's see. From (5,6), to get to (3,5), I can go left twice and down once. Or, perhaps, take a different path.\n\nWait, but if I move left again, I'll be at (4,6), which is one step closer. Then from there, I can decide the next moves. Alternatively, maybe moving up or down first would be better.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (5,6) to (4,6) is fine. Now, from (4,6), what's next? To get to (3,5), I can go left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5). Or from (4,6), go down to (4,5), then left twice to (3,4), but that's a different apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,5) is at y=5, so one down from (3,6). So perhaps from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5) would be ideal. Alternatively, from (5,6), maybe going down first would be better.\n\nWait, if I'm at (5,6), moving down would take me to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then left again to (3,5), which is an apple. That's a possible path. Alternatively, going left first to (4,6), then down twice to (4,4), then left to (3,4), which is another apple.\n\nHmm, so which path is safer? Let's check the board for obstacles. There's an enemy snake at (8,2), which is far away. My own body, since I just moved left, my previous position was (6,6), so I don't have a long body yet. So moving left then down should be safe.\n\nSo, my current position is (5,6). Next move is to go left to (4,6). Then, from there, I can go left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move left from (5,6) to (4,6), that's one step. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) is another step. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) to collect the apple. That would be three moves in total to reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I first go down to (5,5), then left twice to (3,5). That would also take three moves.\n\nWhich is better? Let me think about potential obstacles. From (5,6), going down to (5,5) seems safe because there's nothing there. Then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). That would get me to the apple in three steps.\n\nBut perhaps the path going left first allows me to approach from the top, which might be safer, but I don't see any enemies nearby.\n\nWait, also, there's an apple at (3,4), which is just below (3,5). So after collecting (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) for another apple. That would be a good plan.\n\nBut first, I need to get to (3,5). So, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6), then left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5). That's one way.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). Both paths are similar in steps.\n\nI think either way is fine. Since my last move was LEFT, and I intended to collect the nearest apple safely, I should continue in that direction.\n\nBut wait, the next move is LEFT, as per my last move information. So, I can't change direction yet because I decided to go left again. So from (5,6), the next move is LEFT to (4,6). Then, from there, I can decide whether to go left again or down.\n\nBut perhaps moving left again from (4,6) to (3,6) is possible, and then down to (3,5) for the apple. So my next move would be LEFT.\n\nWait, but if I go left from (5,6) to (4,6), then perhaps the next move should be LEFT again to (3,6), but is that possible? Or is there a wall or something?\n\nLooking at the board state, the point (3,6) is empty. So yes, it's safe to move there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving down first. But I think sticking to the left movement for now is better to reach the apple at (3,5).\n\nSo, my next move will be LEFT to (4,6). Then, in the following move, I'll go LEFT again to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5) to collect the apple.\n\nBut wait, what's the board look like? Let me visualize it again.\n\nAt y=6, the positions are:\n\n(5,6) is me.\n\nNow, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6). That's clear. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6). That's also clear. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) where the apple is.\n\nSo, that's a solid plan. I don't see any immediate threats, so this path should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with moving LEFT again to (4,6).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The closest apples to me seem to be at (5,6) and (4,2), (3,2). But wait, (5,6) is right next to me, just one step to the west. Hmm, that's very close. The other apples are further away, but maybe I should check if moving towards any of them is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see that in row 6, column 5, there's an apple. Since my current position is (7,6), moving left to column 6 would take me to (6,6), which isn't an apple. Wait, actually, looking back, the board shows that at row 6, column 5 is an apple, but wait, the coordinates are (x,y). So (5,6) is the apple, right? Because in the board, it's represented as row 6, column 5. So yes, (5,6) is the position.\n\nSo from (7,6), if I move left, I can go to (6,6), then to (5,6) to get that apple. That seems promising because it's very close. Alternatively, moving up would take me to (7,7), which doesn't have an apple, but moving down to (7,5) also doesn't have an apple.\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions. From the problem statement: Apples at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), (3,5). So (5,6) is indeed there. That's right next to me. So moving left twice would get me to that apple.\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any obstacles or if moving that way would cause me to collide with myself or the wall.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is only at (7,6). I don't have any body parts listed, so I assume it's just the head. So moving left to (6,6) and then to (5,6) should be possible without hitting anything unless enemy snake or another part is there. Enemy snake is at (8,0), which is far away near the bottom right corner.\n\nSo the plan is to move left towards (5,6) to get that apple, which would make me grow and gain a point.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other closer apples or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,1) is far away on the bottom left. (3,2) and (4,2) are also on the lower part of the board, which would require me to move down a lot, which might not be the best move right now.\n\nSo the closest and safest move is to go left towards (5,6). Therefore, my next move should be LEFT.\n\nI should also consider the direction. Moving left decreases the x-coordinate, so from (7,6) to (6,6). That's correct.\n\nWait, but before moving, I should ensure that moving left is possible. My snake's head is at (7,6). If I move left, I'll be at (6,6). Are there any obstacles there? Looking at the board, the only other thing in row 6 is the apple at (5,6). So (6,6) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose another direction, I could check up, down, or right, but those don't seem as beneficial. Moving right would take me to (8,6), which is empty, but there's no apple there. Moving up would take me to (7,7), which is empty. Moving down would take me to (7,5), which is also empty. So LEFT is the best move.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is at (8,0). It's far away, so I don't have to worry about it right now. My priority is to collect the nearby apple to gain points and grow.\n\nSo, to sum up, the next move should be LEFT to move towards the apple at (5,6). That way, in the next step, I can collect the apple and possibly have more options afterward.\n</think>\n\nI should move left to collect the apple at (5,6), as it's the closest and safest option. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 2 in this game. My current position is (5,6). I just moved left, and my last rationale was about collecting the nearest apple safely. Let me look at the board state again.\n\nThe apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), and (3,4). So, looking at the board, let me plot these points. I'm at (5,6), which is on the right side of the board, around the middle. \n\nLast move I went left to (5,6) from (6,6), so my next move is supposed to be left again. Wait, but if I go left from (5,6), I'll end up at (4,6). Let me check what's there. Looking at the board state, at y=6, the only thing is snake 2 at (5,6). So (4,6) is empty. Is that a safe move?\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,2). That's far away from me, so for now, maybe I don't have to worry about it. My main concern is avoiding walls and myself. Since I was moving left, my body is behind me. I need to make sure I don't turn into myself.\n\nSo, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) seems possible. But what's my next goal? The nearest apple. Looking at the list, the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), (3,4). So let's calculate the distance from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,6), the distance to each apple:\n\n- (4,2): That's 1 left and 4 down. So distance is 5.\n- (3,2): 2 left and 4 down, distance 6.\n- (0,1): 5 left and 5 down, distance 10.\n- (3,5): 2 left and 1 down, distance 3.\n- (3,4): 2 left and 2 down, distance 4.\n\nSo the nearest apple is (3,5), which is 3 units away. Then (3,4) is 4 units, (4,2) is 5 units, etc.\n\nSo I should aim for (3,5) or (3,4). Let's see. From (5,6), to get to (3,5), I can go left twice and down once. Or, perhaps, take a different path.\n\nWait, but if I move left again, I'll be at (4,6), which is one step closer. Then from there, I can decide the next moves. Alternatively, maybe moving up or down first would be better.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (5,6) to (4,6) is fine. Now, from (4,6), what's next? To get to (3,5), I can go left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5). Or from (4,6), go down to (4,5), then left twice to (3,4), but that's a different apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,5) is at y=5, so one down from (3,6). So perhaps from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5) would be ideal. Alternatively, from (5,6), maybe going down first would be better.\n\nWait, if I'm at (5,6), moving down would take me to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then left again to (3,5), which is an apple. That's a possible path. Alternatively, going left first to (4,6), then down twice to (4,4), then left to (3,4), which is another apple.\n\nHmm, so which path is safer? Let's check the board for obstacles. There's an enemy snake at (8,2), which is far away. My own body, since I just moved left, my previous position was (6,6), so I don't have a long body yet. So moving left then down should be safe.\n\nSo, my current position is (5,6). Next move is to go left to (4,6). Then, from there, I can go left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move left from (5,6) to (4,6), that's one step. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) is another step. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) to collect the apple. That would be three moves in total to reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I first go down to (5,5), then left twice to (3,5). That would also take three moves.\n\nWhich is better? Let me think about potential obstacles. From (5,6), going down to (5,5) seems safe because there's nothing there. Then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). That would get me to the apple in three steps.\n\nBut perhaps the path going left first allows me to approach from the top, which might be safer, but I don't see any enemies nearby.\n\nWait, also, there's an apple at (3,4), which is just below (3,5). So after collecting (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) for another apple. That would be a good plan.\n\nBut first, I need to get to (3,5). So, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6), then left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5). That's one way.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). Both paths are similar in steps.\n\nI think either way is fine. Since my last move was LEFT, and I intended to collect the nearest apple safely, I should continue in that direction.\n\nBut wait, the next move is LEFT, as per my last move information. So, I can't change direction yet because I decided to go left again. So from (5,6), the next move is LEFT to (4,6). Then, from there, I can decide whether to go left again or down.\n\nBut perhaps moving left again from (4,6) to (3,6) is possible, and then down to (3,5) for the apple. So my next move would be LEFT.\n\nWait, but if I go left from (5,6) to (4,6), then perhaps the next move should be LEFT again to (3,6), but is that possible? Or is there a wall or something?\n\nLooking at the board state, the point (3,6) is empty. So yes, it's safe to move there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving down first. But I think sticking to the left movement for now is better to reach the apple at (3,5).\n\nSo, my next move will be LEFT to (4,6). Then, in the following move, I'll go LEFT again to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5) to collect the apple.\n\nBut wait, what's the board look like? Let me visualize it again.\n\nAt y=6, the positions are:\n\n(5,6) is me.\n\nNow, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6). That's clear. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6). That's also clear. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) where the apple is.\n\nSo, that's a solid plan. I don't see any immediate threats, so this path should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with moving LEFT again to (4,6).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nMy snake is at (7,6). I need to check where the apples are and where the enemy snake is. The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), and (3,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (8,0), and the board shows that my position is near the middle of the board.\n\nI should list the apples and my position to visualize better. My snake is at (7,6). The closest apples to me seem to be at (5,6) and (4,2), (3,2). But wait, (5,6) is right next to me, just one step to the west. Hmm, that's very close. The other apples are further away, but maybe I should check if moving towards any of them is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see that in row 6, column 5, there's an apple. Since my current position is (7,6), moving left to column 6 would take me to (6,6), which isn't an apple. Wait, actually, looking back, the board shows that at row 6, column 5 is an apple, but wait, the coordinates are (x,y). So (5,6) is the apple, right? Because in the board, it's represented as row 6, column 5. So yes, (5,6) is the position.\n\nSo from (7,6), if I move left, I can go to (6,6), then to (5,6) to get that apple. That seems promising because it's very close. Alternatively, moving up would take me to (7,7), which doesn't have an apple, but moving down to (7,5) also doesn't have an apple.\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions. From the problem statement: Apples at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), (3,5). So (5,6) is indeed there. That's right next to me. So moving left twice would get me to that apple.\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any obstacles or if moving that way would cause me to collide with myself or the wall.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is only at (7,6). I don't have any body parts listed, so I assume it's just the head. So moving left to (6,6) and then to (5,6) should be possible without hitting anything unless enemy snake or another part is there. Enemy snake is at (8,0), which is far away near the bottom right corner.\n\nSo the plan is to move left towards (5,6) to get that apple, which would make me grow and gain a point.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other closer apples or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,1) is far away on the bottom left. (3,2) and (4,2) are also on the lower part of the board, which would require me to move down a lot, which might not be the best move right now.\n\nSo the closest and safest move is to go left towards (5,6). Therefore, my next move should be LEFT.\n\nI should also consider the direction. Moving left decreases the x-coordinate, so from (7,6) to (6,6). That's correct.\n\nWait, but before moving, I should ensure that moving left is possible. My snake's head is at (7,6). If I move left, I'll be at (6,6). Are there any obstacles there? Looking at the board, the only other thing in row 6 is the apple at (5,6). So (6,6) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose another direction, I could check up, down, or right, but those don't seem as beneficial. Moving right would take me to (8,6), which is empty, but there's no apple there. Moving up would take me to (7,7), which is empty. Moving down would take me to (7,5), which is also empty. So LEFT is the best move.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is at (8,0). It's far away, so I don't have to worry about it right now. My priority is to collect the nearby apple to gain points and grow.\n\nSo, to sum up, the next move should be LEFT to move towards the apple at (5,6). That way, in the next step, I can collect the apple and possibly have more options afterward.\n</think>\n\nI should move left to collect the apple at (5,6), as it's the closest and safest option. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 2 in this game. My current position is (5,6). I just moved left, and my last rationale was about collecting the nearest apple safely. Let me look at the board state again.\n\nThe apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), and (3,4). So, looking at the board, let me plot these points. I'm at (5,6), which is on the right side of the board, around the middle. \n\nLast move I went left to (5,6) from (6,6), so my next move is supposed to be left again. Wait, but if I go left from (5,6), I'll end up at (4,6). Let me check what's there. Looking at the board state, at y=6, the only thing is snake 2 at (5,6). So (4,6) is empty. Is that a safe move?\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,2). That's far away from me, so for now, maybe I don't have to worry about it. My main concern is avoiding walls and myself. Since I was moving left, my body is behind me. I need to make sure I don't turn into myself.\n\nSo, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) seems possible. But what's my next goal? The nearest apple. Looking at the list, the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), (3,4). So let's calculate the distance from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,6), the distance to each apple:\n\n- (4,2): That's 1 left and 4 down. So distance is 5.\n- (3,2): 2 left and 4 down, distance 6.\n- (0,1): 5 left and 5 down, distance 10.\n- (3,5): 2 left and 1 down, distance 3.\n- (3,4): 2 left and 2 down, distance 4.\n\nSo the nearest apple is (3,5), which is 3 units away. Then (3,4) is 4 units, (4,2) is 5 units, etc.\n\nSo I should aim for (3,5) or (3,4). Let's see. From (5,6), to get to (3,5), I can go left twice and down once. Or, perhaps, take a different path.\n\nWait, but if I move left again, I'll be at (4,6), which is one step closer. Then from there, I can decide the next moves. Alternatively, maybe moving up or down first would be better.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (5,6) to (4,6) is fine. Now, from (4,6), what's next? To get to (3,5), I can go left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5). Or from (4,6), go down to (4,5), then left twice to (3,4), but that's a different apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,5) is at y=5, so one down from (3,6). So perhaps from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5) would be ideal. Alternatively, from (5,6), maybe going down first would be better.\n\nWait, if I'm at (5,6), moving down would take me to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then left again to (3,5), which is an apple. That's a possible path. Alternatively, going left first to (4,6), then down twice to (4,4), then left to (3,4), which is another apple.\n\nHmm, so which path is safer? Let's check the board for obstacles. There's an enemy snake at (8,2), which is far away. My own body, since I just moved left, my previous position was (6,6), so I don't have a long body yet. So moving left then down should be safe.\n\nSo, my current position is (5,6). Next move is to go left to (4,6). Then, from there, I can go left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move left from (5,6) to (4,6), that's one step. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) is another step. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) to collect the apple. That would be three moves in total to reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I first go down to (5,5), then left twice to (3,5). That would also take three moves.\n\nWhich is better? Let me think about potential obstacles. From (5,6), going down to (5,5) seems safe because there's nothing there. Then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). That would get me to the apple in three steps.\n\nBut perhaps the path going left first allows me to approach from the top, which might be safer, but I don't see any enemies nearby.\n\nWait, also, there's an apple at (3,4), which is just below (3,5). So after collecting (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) for another apple. That would be a good plan.\n\nBut first, I need to get to (3,5). So, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6), then left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5). That's one way.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). Both paths are similar in steps.\n\nI think either way is fine. Since my last move was LEFT, and I intended to collect the nearest apple safely, I should continue in that direction.\n\nBut wait, the next move is LEFT, as per my last move information. So, I can't change direction yet because I decided to go left again. So from (5,6), the next move is LEFT to (4,6). Then, from there, I can decide whether to go left again or down.\n\nBut perhaps moving left again from (4,6) to (3,6) is possible, and then down to (3,5) for the apple. So my next move would be LEFT.\n\nWait, but if I go left from (5,6) to (4,6), then perhaps the next move should be LEFT again to (3,6), but is that possible? Or is there a wall or something?\n\nLooking at the board state, the point (3,6) is empty. So yes, it's safe to move there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving down first. But I think sticking to the left movement for now is better to reach the apple at (3,5).\n\nSo, my next move will be LEFT to (4,6). Then, in the following move, I'll go LEFT again to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5) to collect the apple.\n\nBut wait, what's the board look like? Let me visualize it again.\n\nAt y=6, the positions are:\n\n(5,6) is me.\n\nNow, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6). That's clear. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6). That's also clear. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) where the apple is.\n\nSo, that's a solid plan. I don't see any immediate threats, so this path should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with moving LEFT again to (4,6).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), and (9,2). The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,6), and there's another snake at (6,6) with body parts at (6,5), (6,4), (3,4). Wait, no, looking back, snake #1 is at (8,6) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head? Or perhaps the board representation shows all snakes. Actually, the board shows snake #2 at (3,4), snake #1 at (6,6) with body extending down, and another at (6,3). Wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify the board:\n\nLooking at the board state provided, it's a 10x10 grid. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, the top row is y=9, and the bottom row is y=0, with x from 0 to 9.\n\nThe board is represented as:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . T T . . . 1 .\n5 . . T . . . . . .\n4 . . T . . . . . .\n3 . . 2 . . A . . .\n2 . . A A A . . . .\n1 A . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, no, the original board state was:\n\nAt y=9, all dots except for (9,9) which is a dot.\n\ny=8: all dots.\n\ny=7: all dots.\n\ny=6: At (6,6), 'T', (5,6) 'T', then at (8,6) '1' for snake #1.\n\ny=5: (6,5) 'T', so that's the body of snake #1 extending downward.\n\ny=4: (6,4) 'T', (3,4) '2' (which is my snake's head), (0,4) is a dot.\n\nWait, no, according to the initial description, the board state is:\n\nIt shows that at y=6, the positions (6,6), (7,6), and (8,6) have 'T's. Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the board layout. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe board is presented as rows, starting from y=9 down to y=0, with each row showing x from 0 to 9. So, the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\ny=9: all dots.\n\ny=8: all dots.\n\ny=7: all dots.\n\ny=6: positions (3,6) and (4,6) are 'T's, then (8,6) is '1' (snake #1's head).\n\ny=5: (3,5) is 'T', which is part of snake #1's body.\n\ny=4: (3,4) is '2' (my snake's head).\n\ny=3: (0,3) is 'A', (2,3) is 'A', (3,3) is 'A', (4,3) is 'A'.\n\ny=2: (2,2) is 'A', (3,2) is 'A', (4,2) is 'A', (9,2) is 'A'.\n\ny=1: (0,1) is 'A'.\n\ny=0: all dots except (0,0) which is a dot.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try to reconstruct the board correctly.\n\nWait, the user might have provided the board with the y-axis decreasing from top to bottom, but in the description, they have:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . T T . . . 1 .\n5 . . T . . . . . .\n4 . . . 2 . . . . . .\n3 . . A . . . . . . .\n2 . . . A A . . . . A\n1 A . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, this is y from 9 to 0, each line representing y from 9 down. So each row is a specific y value.\n\nSo, for example, at y=6, we have:\n\nAt x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: T, x=4: T, x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: 1 (snake #1's head), x=9: .\n\nSimilarly, at y=5: x=3 is T.\n\nAt y=4: x=3 is 2 (my snake's head).\n\nAt y=3: x=2 and x=3 are A's, and so on.\n\nSo my snake is at (3,4), which is y=4, x=3.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(4,2): x=4, y=2.\n\n(3,2): x=3, y=2.\n\n(0,1): x=0, y=1.\n\n(2,3): x=2, y=3.\n\n(9,2): x=9, y=2.\n\nWait, from the board, at y=2 (line: \"2 . . . A A . . . . A\") the apples are at x=4 (y=2, x=4), x=3 (y=2, x=3), and x=9 (y=2, x=9). So the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), and (9,2). Then, at y=3, x=2 has an apple, and y=1, x=0 has an apple.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the apples are listed as (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), (9,2). So that's correct.\n\nNow, the enemy snakes: snake #1 is at (8,6), and there's another snake at (6,6) with body parts at [ ]? Wait, the initial description says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n* Snake #6 is at position (6,6) with body at (6,5), (6,4), (3,4)\"\n\nWait, that might be a confusion. Let me re-examine the original problem statement.\n\nThe user provided:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n\nBoard state:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . .

A\n1 A . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\"\n\nSo at y=6, x=6 is 'T', x=7 is 'T', and x=8 is '1' (snake #1's head). Then at y=5, x=3 is 'T', y=4, x=3 is '2' (my head), and y=3, x=2 is 'A', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The 'T's might represent another snake's body parts. So maybe there's a snake starting at (6,6) going downward. Let me check:\n\nAt y=6: x=6 is 'T', x=7 is 'T', x=8 is '1' (snake #1's head).\n\nAt y=5: x=3 is 'T', so perhaps that's a different snake's body.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the board correctly.\n\nLooking at y=6: the line is \". . T T . . . 1 .\", meaning at x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: T, x=4: T, x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: 1, x=9: .\n\nSimilarly, at y=5: the line is \". . T . . . . . .\", meaning x=3 is T.\n\nAt y=4: \". . . 2 . . . . .\", so x=3 is 2.\n\nSo snake #2 (me) is at (3,4). There's a 'T' at (3,5), which must be part of another snake. So, perhaps snake #6 is at (6,6), with body parts at (6,5), (6,4), and (3,4). Wait, that would mean that (3,4) is the tail of snake #6, but I'm at (3,4), which is my head. That can't be right because a snake can't occupy the same position as another snake unless they collide. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'T's are apples or something else. Or maybe 'T' represents another snake's body. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe problem says that enemy snakes are:\n\n- Snake #1 is at (8,6) with body at [].\n\nSo snake #1's head is at (8,6), and it has no body parts listed, meaning it's just the head. Then, at y=6, x=6 and x=7 are 'T's, which might be another snake.\n\nBut the problem didn't mention other snakes except for snake #1. Wait, the initial description says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n\nBoard state:\n\n...\"\n\nWait, maybe the 'T's are part of another snake, but the problem only specifies snake #1. So perhaps snake #1 has a body extending from (8,6) downward? But the board shows at y=6, x=6 and x=7 as 'T's, and at y=5, x=3 as 'T'.\n\nI think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me focus on what's given:\n\nMy snake is at (3,4). The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), (9,2). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,6).\n\nSo, I need to decide my next move. I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving UP would take me to (3,5). Moving DOWN would be to (3,3). LEFT to (2,4). RIGHT to (4,4).\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (3,2), which is two moves DOWN (to (3,3) and (3,2)). Alternatively, (2,3) is one LEFT and one UP from (3,4): (2,4) then (2,3). Similarly, (4,2) is to the RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nWait, but I'm at (3,4). Let's check for possible obstacles.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,5), is that safe? The enemy snake is at (8,6), so not nearby. Are there any other snakes there? At (3,5), the board shows a 'T', which might be a body part of another snake. Wait, the board at y=5, x=3 is 'T', so if I move UP, I would land on (3,5), which is 'T', perhaps part of another snake. That might be dangerous because if 'T' is part of another snake, moving there could cause a collision, killing me.\n\nSimilarly, moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe, as I don't see any enemy there.Moving RIGHT to (4,4) is safe, as I don't see any enemy there. Moving DOWN to (3,3) would take me to an apple at (3,2) next.\n\nBut moving to (3,5) is risky because of the 'T' there. Maybe that's part of another snake.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the enemy snakes are only snake #1 at (8,6) with no body parts. So perhaps the 'T's are just parts of the board, not snakes. Or maybe they're apples or something else. Wait, no, the apples are marked as 'A's, so 'T's must be something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'T's are obstacles or part of another game element, but the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to ignore them or assume they're just part of the board and not snakes.\n\nGiven that, I can proceed with moving towards the nearest apple.\n\nThe apples are at (3,2), which is two moves DOWN, but perhaps I can get there quickly. Alternatively, (2,3) is one LEFT and one UP. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3), I can collect that apple. That seems safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN twice to (3,2) is also possible.\n\nI should also consider where the enemy snake is. Snake #1 is at (8,6). If I move towards (2,3), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good. If I go towards (3,2), I'm also moving away.\n\nBut perhaps the closer apple is at (3,2), so moving DOWN twice would be better.\n\nWait, let me check the coordinates again. From (3,4), moving DOWN once takes me to (3,3), and then to (3,2). So two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT once to (2,4), then UP once to (2,3) is also two moves.\n\nBut (2,3) is an apple, and moving there might be safer because I can turn UP directly into an apple, whereas going DOWN to (3,2) might put me closer to the enemy if they move downward.\n\nWait, the enemy at (8,6) is quite far from (3,2), so maybe it's safe. Alternatively, moving to (2,3) might be more strategic because it's a different area.\n\nI think moving to (2,3) might be better because it's an apple and moving there gets me away from the enemy's potential path.\n\nSo, the plan is: move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3) to collect the apple. But my next move should be LEFT to (2,4).\n\nWait, but I can only move once per turn. So next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, let's check if moving LEFT is safe. At (2,4), is there any obstruction? From the board, y=4, x=2 is a dot, so it's clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move UP to (3,5), but as y=5, x=3 is 'T', which might be an obstruction or another snake, so it's risky.\n\nSo, I think the best move is LEFT towards (2,4), heading towards the apple at (2,3).\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's an apple closer. From (3,4), the apple at (3,2) is two moves down, which is manageable, but the apple at (2,3) is closer in terms of steps (two moves: LEFT and UP).\n\nAlternatively, I could go RIGHT to (4,4) and then DOWN to (4,3), which is near (4,2). But that's three moves: RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN again.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (2,4) and then UP to (2,3) seems more efficient.\n\nYes, I think moving LEFT is the best next move.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the apple at (2,3), I will move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3) in subsequent moves. This path avoids potential conflicts with the enemy snake and efficiently collects an apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #2 in this game, and I need to figure out where to move next. Let me start by looking at the current board state. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nMy snake is at (7,6). I need to check where the apples are and where the enemy snake is. The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), and (3,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (8,0), and the board shows that my position is near the middle of the board.\n\nI should list the apples and my position to visualize better. My snake is at (7,6). The closest apples to me seem to be at (5,6) and (4,2), (3,2). But wait, (5,6) is right next to me, just one step to the west. Hmm, that's very close. The other apples are further away, but maybe I should check if moving towards any of them is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see that in row 6, column 5, there's an apple. Since my current position is (7,6), moving left to column 6 would take me to (6,6), which isn't an apple. Wait, actually, looking back, the board shows that at row 6, column 5 is an apple, but wait, the coordinates are (x,y). So (5,6) is the apple, right? Because in the board, it's represented as row 6, column 5. So yes, (5,6) is the position.\n\nSo from (7,6), if I move left, I can go to (6,6), then to (5,6) to get that apple. That seems promising because it's very close. Alternatively, moving up would take me to (7,7), which doesn't have an apple, but moving down to (7,5) also doesn't have an apple.\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions. From the problem statement: Apples at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), (3,5). So (5,6) is indeed there. That's right next to me. So moving left twice would get me to that apple.\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any obstacles or if moving that way would cause me to collide with myself or the wall.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is only at (7,6). I don't have any body parts listed, so I assume it's just the head. So moving left to (6,6) and then to (5,6) should be possible without hitting anything unless enemy snake or another part is there. Enemy snake is at (8,0), which is far away near the bottom right corner.\n\nSo the plan is to move left towards (5,6) to get that apple, which would make me grow and gain a point.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other closer apples or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,1) is far away on the bottom left. (3,2) and (4,2) are also on the lower part of the board, which would require me to move down a lot, which might not be the best move right now.\n\nSo the closest and safest move is to go left towards (5,6). Therefore, my next move should be LEFT.\n\nI should also consider the direction. Moving left decreases the x-coordinate, so from (7,6) to (6,6). That's correct.\n\nWait, but before moving, I should ensure that moving left is possible. My snake's head is at (7,6). If I move left, I'll be at (6,6). Are there any obstacles there? Looking at the board, the only other thing in row 6 is the apple at (5,6). So (6,6) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose another direction, I could check up, down, or right, but those don't seem as beneficial. Moving right would take me to (8,6), which is empty, but there's no apple there. Moving up would take me to (7,7), which is empty. Moving down would take me to (7,5), which is also empty. So LEFT is the best move.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is at (8,0). It's far away, so I don't have to worry about it right now. My priority is to collect the nearby apple to gain points and grow.\n\nSo, to sum up, the next move should be LEFT to move towards the apple at (5,6). That way, in the next step, I can collect the apple and possibly have more options afterward.\n</think>\n\nI should move left to collect the apple at (5,6), as it's the closest and safest option. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 2 in this game. My current position is (5,6). I just moved left, and my last rationale was about collecting the nearest apple safely. Let me look at the board state again.\n\nThe apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), and (3,4). So, looking at the board, let me plot these points. I'm at (5,6), which is on the right side of the board, around the middle. \n\nLast move I went left to (5,6) from (6,6), so my next move is supposed to be left again. Wait, but if I go left from (5,6), I'll end up at (4,6). Let me check what's there. Looking at the board state, at y=6, the only thing is snake 2 at (5,6). So (4,6) is empty. Is that a safe move?\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,2). That's far away from me, so for now, maybe I don't have to worry about it. My main concern is avoiding walls and myself. Since I was moving left, my body is behind me. I need to make sure I don't turn into myself.\n\nSo, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) seems possible. But what's my next goal? The nearest apple. Looking at the list, the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), (3,4). So let's calculate the distance from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,6), the distance to each apple:\n\n- (4,2): That's 1 left and 4 down. So distance is 5.\n- (3,2): 2 left and 4 down, distance 6.\n- (0,1): 5 left and 5 down, distance 10.\n- (3,5): 2 left and 1 down, distance 3.\n- (3,4): 2 left and 2 down, distance 4.\n\nSo the nearest apple is (3,5), which is 3 units away. Then (3,4) is 4 units, (4,2) is 5 units, etc.\n\nSo I should aim for (3,5) or (3,4). Let's see. From (5,6), to get to (3,5), I can go left twice and down once. Or, perhaps, take a different path.\n\nWait, but if I move left again, I'll be at (4,6), which is one step closer. Then from there, I can decide the next moves. Alternatively, maybe moving up or down first would be better.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (5,6) to (4,6) is fine. Now, from (4,6), what's next? To get to (3,5), I can go left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5). Or from (4,6), go down to (4,5), then left twice to (3,4), but that's a different apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,5) is at y=5, so one down from (3,6). So perhaps from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5) would be ideal. Alternatively, from (5,6), maybe going down first would be better.\n\nWait, if I'm at (5,6), moving down would take me to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then left again to (3,5), which is an apple. That's a possible path. Alternatively, going left first to (4,6), then down twice to (4,4), then left to (3,4), which is another apple.\n\nHmm, so which path is safer? Let's check the board for obstacles. There's an enemy snake at (8,2), which is far away. My own body, since I just moved left, my previous position was (6,6), so I don't have a long body yet. So moving left then down should be safe.\n\nSo, my current position is (5,6). Next move is to go left to (4,6). Then, from there, I can go left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move left from (5,6) to (4,6), that's one step. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) is another step. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) to collect the apple. That would be three moves in total to reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I first go down to (5,5), then left twice to (3,5). That would also take three moves.\n\nWhich is better? Let me think about potential obstacles. From (5,6), going down to (5,5) seems safe because there's nothing there. Then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). That would get me to the apple in three steps.\n\nBut perhaps the path going left first allows me to approach from the top, which might be safer, but I don't see any enemies nearby.\n\nWait, also, there's an apple at (3,4), which is just below (3,5). So after collecting (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) for another apple. That would be a good plan.\n\nBut first, I need to get to (3,5). So, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6), then left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5). That's one way.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). Both paths are similar in steps.\n\nI think either way is fine. Since my last move was LEFT, and I intended to collect the nearest apple safely, I should continue in that direction.\n\nBut wait, the next move is LEFT, as per my last move information. So, I can't change direction yet because I decided to go left again. So from (5,6), the next move is LEFT to (4,6). Then, from there, I can decide whether to go left again or down.\n\nBut perhaps moving left again from (4,6) to (3,6) is possible, and then down to (3,5) for the apple. So my next move would be LEFT.\n\nWait, but if I go left from (5,6) to (4,6), then perhaps the next move should be LEFT again to (3,6), but is that possible? Or is there a wall or something?\n\nLooking at the board state, the point (3,6) is empty. So yes, it's safe to move there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving down first. But I think sticking to the left movement for now is better to reach the apple at (3,5).\n\nSo, my next move will be LEFT to (4,6). Then, in the following move, I'll go LEFT again to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5) to collect the apple.\n\nBut wait, what's the board look like? Let me visualize it again.\n\nAt y=6, the positions are:\n\n(5,6) is me.\n\nNow, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6). That's clear. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6). That's also clear. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) where the apple is.\n\nSo, that's a solid plan. I don't see any immediate threats, so this path should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with moving LEFT again to (4,6).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The next move should be DOWN to (3,5) to collect that apple. \n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any obstacles in that path.

So, moving DOWN now makes sense because it gets me the apple and increases my score. \n\nI should also think about what to do after getting this apple. The other apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), and (3,4). The apple at (3,4) is close, just below (3,5), so maybe after this, I can go there next.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 2, which is currently at position (3,4). Let me take a look at the board and the current state of the game. The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), and (9,2). The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,6), and there's another snake at (6,6) with body parts at (6,5), (6,4), (3,4). Wait, no, looking back, snake #1 is at (8,6) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head? Or perhaps the board representation shows all snakes. Actually, the board shows snake #2 at (3,4), snake #1 at (6,6) with body extending down, and another at (6,3). Wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify the board:\n\nLooking at the board state provided, it's a 10x10 grid. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, the top row is y=9, and the bottom row is y=0, with x from 0 to 9.\n\nThe board is represented as:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . T T . . . 1 .\n5 . . T . . . . . .\n4 . . T . . . . . .\n3 . . 2 . . A . . .\n2 . . A A A . . . .\n1 A . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, no, the original board state was:\n\nAt y=9, all dots except for (9,9) which is a dot.\n\ny=8: all dots.\n\ny=7: all dots.\n\ny=6: At (6,6), 'T', (5,6) 'T', then at (8,6) '1' for snake #1.\n\ny=5: (6,5) 'T', so that's the body of snake #1 extending downward.\n\ny=4: (6,4) 'T', (3,4) '2' (which is my snake's head), (0,4) is a dot.\n\nWait, no, according to the initial description, the board state is:\n\nIt shows that at y=6, the positions (6,6), (7,6), and (8,6) have 'T's. Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the board layout. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe board is presented as rows, starting from y=9 down to y=0, with each row showing x from 0 to 9. So, the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\ny=9: all dots.\n\ny=8: all dots.\n\ny=7: all dots.\n\ny=6: positions (3,6) and (4,6) are 'T's, then (8,6) is '1' (snake #1's head).\n\ny=5: (3,5) is 'T', which is part of snake #1's body.\n\ny=4: (3,4) is '2' (my snake's head).\n\ny=3: (0,3) is 'A', (2,3) is 'A', (3,3) is 'A', (4,3) is 'A'.\n\ny=2: (2,2) is 'A', (3,2) is 'A', (4,2) is 'A', (9,2) is 'A'.\n\ny=1: (0,1) is 'A'.\n\ny=0: all dots except (0,0) which is a dot.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try to reconstruct the board correctly.\n\nWait, the user might have provided the board with the y-axis decreasing from top to bottom, but in the description, they have:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . T T . . . 1 .\n5 . . T . . . . . .\n4 . . . 2 . . . . . .\n3 . . A . . . . . . .\n2 . . . A A . . . . A\n1 A . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, this is y from 9 to 0, each line representing y from 9 down. So each row is a specific y value.\n\nSo, for example, at y=6, we have:\n\nAt x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: T, x=4: T, x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: 1 (snake #1's head), x=9: .\n\nSimilarly, at y=5: x=3 is T.\n\nAt y=4: x=3 is 2 (my snake's head).\n\nAt y=3: x=2 and x=3 are A's, and so on.\n\nSo my snake is at (3,4), which is y=4, x=3.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(4,2): x=4, y=2.\n\n(3,2): x=3, y=2.\n\n(0,1): x=0, y=1.\n\n(2,3): x=2, y=3.\n\n(9,2): x=9, y=2.\n\nWait, from the board, at y=2 (line: \"2 . . . A A . . . . A\") the apples are at x=4 (y=2, x=4), x=3 (y=2, x=3), and x=9 (y=2, x=9). So the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), and (9,2). Then, at y=3, x=2 has an apple, and y=1, x=0 has an apple.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the apples are listed as (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), (9,2). So that's correct.\n\nNow, the enemy snakes: snake #1 is at (8,6), and there's another snake at (6,6) with body parts at [ ]? Wait, the initial description says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n* Snake #6 is at position (6,6) with body at (6,5), (6,4), (3,4)\"\n\nWait, that might be a confusion. Let me re-examine the original problem statement.\n\nThe user provided:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n\nBoard state:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . T T . . . 1 .\n5 . . T . . . . . .\n4 . . T . . . . . .\n3 . . A . . . . . .\n2 . . . A A . . . . A\n1 A . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\"\n\nSo at y=6, x=6 is 'T', x=7 is 'T', and x=8 is '1' (snake #1's head). Then at y=5, x=3 is 'T', y=4, x=3 is '2' (my head), and y=3, x=2 is 'A', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The 'T's might represent another snake's body parts. So maybe there's a snake starting at (6,6) going downward. Let me check:\n\nAt y=6: x=6 is 'T', x=7 is 'T', x=8 is '1' (snake #1's head).\n\nAt y=5: x=3 is 'T', so perhaps that's a different snake's body.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the board correctly.\n\nLooking at y=6: the line is \". . T T . . . 1 .\", meaning at x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: T, x=4: T, x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: 1, x=9: .\n\nSimilarly, at y=5: the line is \". . T . . . . . .\", meaning x=3 is T.\n\nAt y=4: \". . . 2 . . . . .\", so x=3 is 2.\n\nSo snake #2 (me) is at (3,4). There's a 'T' at (3,5), which must be part of another snake. So, perhaps snake #6 is at (6,6), with body parts at (6,5), (6,4), and (3,4). Wait, that would mean that (3,4) is the tail of snake #6, but I'm at (3,4), which is my head. That can't be right because a snake can't occupy the same position as another snake unless they collide. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'T's are apples or something else. Or maybe 'T' represents another snake's body. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe problem says that enemy snakes are:\n\n- Snake #1 is at (8,6) with body at [].\n\nSo snake #1's head is at (8,6), and it has no body parts listed, meaning it's just the head. Then, at y=6, x=6 and x=7 are 'T's, which might be another snake.\n\nBut the problem didn't mention other snakes except for snake #1. Wait, the initial description says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n\nBoard state:\n\n...\"\n\nWait, maybe the 'T's are part of another snake, but the problem only specifies snake #1. So perhaps snake #1 has a body extending from (8,6) downward? But the board shows at y=6, x=6 and x=7 as 'T's, and at y=5, x=3 as 'T'.\n\nI think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me focus on what's given:\n\nMy snake is at (3,4). The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), (9,2). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,6).\n\nSo, I need to decide my next move. I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving UP would take me to (3,5). Moving DOWN would be to (3,3). LEFT to (2,4). RIGHT to (4,4).\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (3,2), which is two moves DOWN (to (3,3) and (3,2)). Alternatively, (2,3) is one LEFT and one UP from (3,4): (2,4) then (2,3). Similarly, (4,2) is to the RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nWait, but I'm at (3,4). Let's check for possible obstacles.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,5), is that safe? The enemy snake is at (8,6), so not nearby. Are there any other snakes there? At (3,5), the board shows a 'T', which might be a body part of another snake. Wait, the board at y=5, x=3 is 'T', so if I move UP, I would land on (3,5), which is 'T', perhaps part of another snake. That might be dangerous because if 'T' is part of another snake, moving there could cause a collision, killing me.\n\nSimilarly, moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe, as I don't see any enemy there.Moving RIGHT to (4,4) is safe, as I don't see any enemy there. Moving DOWN to (3,3) would take me to an apple at (3,2) next.\n\nBut moving to (3,5) is risky because of the 'T' there. Maybe that's part of another snake.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the enemy snakes are only snake #1 at (8,6) with no body parts. So perhaps the 'T's are just parts of the board, not snakes. Or maybe they're apples or something else. Wait, no, the apples are marked as 'A's, so 'T's must be something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'T's are obstacles or part of another game element, but the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to ignore them or assume they're just part of the board and not snakes.\n\nGiven that, I can proceed with moving towards the nearest apple.\n\nThe apples are at (3,2), which is two moves DOWN, but perhaps I can get there quickly. Alternatively, (2,3) is one LEFT and one UP. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3), I can collect that apple. That seems safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN twice to (3,2) is also possible.\n\nI should also consider where the enemy snake is. Snake #1 is at (8,6). If I move towards (2,3), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good. If I go towards (3,2), I'm also moving away.\n\nBut perhaps the closer apple is at (3,2), so moving DOWN twice would be better.\n\nWait, let me check the coordinates again. From (3,4), moving DOWN once takes me to (3,3), and then to (3,2). So two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT once to (2,4), then UP once to (2,3) is also two moves.\n\nBut (2,3) is an apple, and moving there might be safer because I can turn UP directly into an apple, whereas going DOWN to (3,2) might put me closer to the enemy if they move downward.\n\nWait, the enemy at (8,6) is quite far from (3,2), so maybe it's safe. Alternatively, moving to (2,3) might be more strategic because it's a different area.\n\nI think moving to (2,3) might be better because it's an apple and moving there gets me away from the enemy's potential path.\n\nSo, the plan is: move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3) to collect the apple. But my next move should be LEFT to (2,4).\n\nWait, but I can only move once per turn. So next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, let's check if moving LEFT is safe. At (2,4), is there any obstruction? From the board, y=4, x=2 is a dot, so it's clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move UP to (3,5), but as y=5, x=3 is 'T', which might be an obstruction or another snake, so it's risky.\n\nSo, I think the best move is LEFT towards (2,4), heading towards the apple at (2,3).\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's an apple closer. From (3,4), the apple at (3,2) is two moves down, which is manageable, but the apple at (2,3) is closer in terms of steps (two moves: LEFT and UP).\n\nAlternatively, I could go RIGHT to (4,4) and then DOWN to (4,3), which is near (4,2). But that's three moves: RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN again.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (2,4) and then UP to (2,3) seems more efficient.\n\nYes, I think moving LEFT is the best next move.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the apple at (2,3), I will move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3) in subsequent moves. This path avoids potential conflicts with the enemy snake and efficiently collects an apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nMy snake is at (7,6). I need to check where the apples are and where the enemy snake is. The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), and (3,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (8,0), and the board shows that my position is near the middle of the board.\n\nI should list the apples and my position to visualize better. My snake is at (7,6). The closest apples to me seem to be at (5,6) and (4,2), (3,2). But wait, (5,6) is right next to me, just one step to the west. Hmm, that's very close. The other apples are further away, but maybe I should check if moving towards any of them is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, looking at the board, I see that in row 6, column 5, there's an apple. Since my current position is (7,6), moving left to column 6 would take me to (6,6), which isn't an apple. Wait, actually, looking back, the board shows that at row 6, column 5 is an apple, but wait, the coordinates are (x,y). So (5,6) is the apple, right? Because in the board, it's represented as row 6, column 5. So yes, (5,6) is the position.\n\nSo from (7,6), if I move left, I can go to (6,6), then to (5,6) to get that apple. That seems promising because it's very close. Alternatively, moving up would take me to (7,7), which doesn't have an apple, but moving down to (7,5) also doesn't have an apple.\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions. From the problem statement: Apples at (4,2), (3,2), (5,6), (0,1), (3,5). So (5,6) is indeed there. That's right next to me. So moving left twice would get me to that apple.\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any obstacles or if moving that way would cause me to collide with myself or the wall.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is only at (7,6). I don't have any body parts listed, so I assume it's just the head. So moving left to (6,6) and then to (5,6) should be possible without hitting anything unless enemy snake or another part is there. Enemy snake is at (8,0), which is far away near the bottom right corner.\n\nSo the plan is to move left towards (5,6) to get that apple, which would make me grow and gain a point.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other closer apples or any immediate threats.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,1) is far away on the bottom left. (3,2) and (4,2) are also on the lower part of the board, which would require me to move down a lot, which might not be the best move right now.\n\nSo the closest and safest move is to go left towards (5,6). Therefore, my next move should be LEFT.\n\nI should also consider the direction. Moving left decreases the x-coordinate, so from (7,6) to (6,6). That's correct.\n\nWait, but before moving, I should ensure that moving left is possible. My snake's head is at (7,6). If I move left, I'll be at (6,6). Are there any obstacles there? Looking at the board, the only other thing in row 6 is the apple at (5,6). So (6,6) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to choose another direction, I could check up, down, or right, but those don't seem as beneficial. Moving right would take me to (8,6), which is empty, but there's no apple there. Moving up would take me to (7,7), which is empty. Moving down would take me to (7,5), which is also empty. So LEFT is the best move.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is at (8,0). It's far away, so I don't have to worry about it right now. My priority is to collect the nearby apple to gain points and grow.\n\nSo, to sum up, the next move should be LEFT to move towards the apple at (5,6). That way, in the next step, I can collect the apple and possibly have more options afterward.\n</think>\n\nI should move left to collect the apple at (5,6), as it's the closest and safest option. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 2 in this game. My current position is (5,6). I just moved left, and my last rationale was about collecting the nearest apple safely. Let me look at the board state again.\n\nThe apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), and (3,4). So, looking at the board, let me plot these points. I'm at (5,6), which is on the right side of the board, around the middle. \n\nLast move I went left to (5,6) from (6,6), so my next move is supposed to be left again. Wait, but if I go left from (5,6), I'll end up at (4,6). Let me check what's there. Looking at the board state, at y=6, the only thing is snake 2 at (5,6). So (4,6) is empty. Is that a safe move?\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,2). That's far away from me, so for now, maybe I don't have to worry about it. My main concern is avoiding walls and myself. Since I was moving left, my body is behind me. I need to make sure I don't turn into myself.\n\nSo, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) seems possible. But what's my next goal? The nearest apple. Looking at the list, the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (3,5), (3,4). So let's calculate the distance from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,6), the distance to each apple:\n\n- (4,2): That's 1 left and 4 down. So distance is 5.\n- (3,2): 2 left and 4 down, distance 6.\n- (0,1): 5 left and 5 down, distance 10.\n- (3,5): 2 left and 1 down, distance 3.\n- (3,4): 2 left and 2 down, distance 4.\n\nSo the nearest apple is (3,5), which is 3 units away. Then (3,4) is 4 units, (4,2) is 5 units, etc.\n\nSo I should aim for (3,5) or (3,4). Let's see. From (5,6), to get to (3,5), I can go left twice and down once. Or, perhaps, take a different path.\n\nWait, but if I move left again, I'll be at (4,6), which is one step closer. Then from there, I can decide the next moves. Alternatively, maybe moving up or down first would be better.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (5,6) to (4,6) is fine. Now, from (4,6), what's next? To get to (3,5), I can go left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5). Or from (4,6), go down to (4,5), then left twice to (3,4), but that's a different apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,5) is at y=5, so one down from (3,6). So perhaps from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) and then down to (3,5) would be ideal. Alternatively, from (5,6), maybe going down first would be better.\n\nWait, if I'm at (5,6), moving down would take me to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then left again to (3,5), which is an apple. That's a possible path. Alternatively, going left first to (4,6), then down twice to (4,4), then left to (3,4), which is another apple.\n\nHmm, so which path is safer? Let's check the board for obstacles. There's an enemy snake at (8,2), which is far away. My own body, since I just moved left, my previous position was (6,6), so I don't have a long body yet. So moving left then down should be safe.\n\nSo, my current position is (5,6). Next move is to go left to (4,6). Then, from there, I can go left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move left from (5,6) to (4,6), that's one step. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6) is another step. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) to collect the apple. That would be three moves in total to reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I first go down to (5,5), then left twice to (3,5). That would also take three moves.\n\nWhich is better? Let me think about potential obstacles. From (5,6), going down to (5,5) seems safe because there's nothing there. Then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). That would get me to the apple in three steps.\n\nBut perhaps the path going left first allows me to approach from the top, which might be safer, but I don't see any enemies nearby.\n\nWait, also, there's an apple at (3,4), which is just below (3,5). So after collecting (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) for another apple. That would be a good plan.\n\nBut first, I need to get to (3,5). So, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6), then left again to (3,6), then down to (3,5). That's one way.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5). Both paths are similar in steps.\n\nI think either way is fine. Since my last move was LEFT, and I intended to collect the nearest apple safely, I should continue in that direction.\n\nBut wait, the next move is LEFT, as per my last move information. So, I can't change direction yet because I decided to go left again. So from (5,6), the next move is LEFT to (4,6). Then, from there, I can decide whether to go left again or down.\n\nBut perhaps moving left again from (4,6) to (3,6) is possible, and then down to (3,5) for the apple. So my next move would be LEFT.\n\nWait, but if I go left from (5,6) to (4,6), then perhaps the next move should be LEFT again to (3,6), but is that possible? Or is there a wall or something?\n\nLooking at the board state, the point (3,6) is empty. So yes, it's safe to move there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving down first. But I think sticking to the left movement for now is better to reach the apple at (3,5).\n\nSo, my next move will be LEFT to (4,6). Then, in the following move, I'll go LEFT again to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5) to collect the apple.\n\nBut wait, what's the board look like? Let me visualize it again.\n\nAt y=6, the positions are:\n\n(5,6) is me.\n\nNow, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6). That's clear. Then, from (4,6), moving left to (3,6). That's also clear. Then from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) where the apple is.\n\nSo, that's a solid plan. I don't see any immediate threats, so this path should be safe.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with moving LEFT again to (4,6).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), and (9,2). The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,6), and there's another snake at (6,6) with body parts at (6,5), (6,4), (3,4). Wait, no, looking back, snake #1 is at (8,6) with an empty body, so maybe it's just the head? Or perhaps the board representation shows all snakes. Actually, the board shows snake #2 at (3,4), snake #1 at (6,6) with body extending down, and another at (6,3). Wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify the board:\n\nLooking at the board state provided, it's a 10x10 grid. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, the top row is y=9, and the bottom row is y=0, with x from 0 to 9.\n\nThe board is represented as:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . T T . . . 1 .\n5 . . T . . . . . .\n4 . . T . . . . . .\n3 . . 2 . . A . . .\n2 . . A A A . . . .\n1 A . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, no, the original board state was:\n\nAt y=9, all dots except for (9,9) which is a dot.\n\ny=8: all dots.\n\ny=7: all dots.\n\ny=6: At (6,6), 'T', (5,6) 'T', then at (8,6) '1' for snake #1.\n\ny=5: (6,5) 'T', so that's the body of snake #1 extending downward.\n\ny=4: (6,4) 'T', (3,4) '2' (which is my snake's head), (0,4) is a dot.\n\nWait, no, according to the initial description, the board state is:\n\nIt shows that at y=6, the positions (6,6), (7,6), and (8,6) have 'T's. Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the board layout. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe board is presented as rows, starting from y=9 down to y=0, with each row showing x from 0 to 9. So, the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\ny=9: all dots.\n\ny=8: all dots.\n\ny=7: all dots.\n\ny=6: positions (3,6) and (4,6) are 'T's, then (8,6) is '1' (snake #1's head).\n\ny=5: (3,5) is 'T', which is part of snake #1's body.\n\ny=4: (3,4) is '2' (my snake's head).\n\ny=3: (0,3) is 'A', (2,3) is 'A', (3,3) is 'A', (4,3) is 'A'.\n\ny=2: (2,2) is 'A', (3,2) is 'A', (4,2) is 'A', (9,2) is 'A'.\n\ny=1: (0,1) is 'A'.\n\ny=0: all dots except (0,0) which is a dot.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try to reconstruct the board correctly.\n\nWait, the user might have provided the board with the y-axis decreasing from top to bottom, but in the description, they have:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . T T . . . 1 .\n5 . . T . . . . . .\n4 . . . 2 . . . . . .\n3 . . A . . . . . . .\n2 . . . A A . . . . A\n1 A . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, this is y from 9 to 0, each line representing y from 9 down. So each row is a specific y value.\n\nSo, for example, at y=6, we have:\n\nAt x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: T, x=4: T, x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: 1 (snake #1's head), x=9: .\n\nSimilarly, at y=5: x=3 is T.\n\nAt y=4: x=3 is 2 (my snake's head).\n\nAt y=3: x=2 and x=3 are A's, and so on.\n\nSo my snake is at (3,4), which is y=4, x=3.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(4,2): x=4, y=2.\n\n(3,2): x=3, y=2.\n\n(0,1): x=0, y=1.\n\n(2,3): x=2, y=3.\n\n(9,2): x=9, y=2.\n\nWait, from the board, at y=2 (line: \"2 . . . A A . . . . A\") the apples are at x=4 (y=2, x=4), x=3 (y=2, x=3), and x=9 (y=2, x=9). So the apples are at (4,2), (3,2), and (9,2). Then, at y=3, x=2 has an apple, and y=1, x=0 has an apple.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the apples are listed as (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), (9,2). So that's correct.\n\nNow, the enemy snakes: snake #1 is at (8,6), and there's another snake at (6,6) with body parts at [ ]? Wait, the initial description says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n* Snake #6 is at position (6,6) with body at (6,5), (6,4), (3,4)\"\n\nWait, that might be a confusion. Let me re-examine the original problem statement.\n\nThe user provided:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n\nBoard state:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . .

A\n1 A . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\"\n\nSo at y=6, x=6 is 'T', x=7 is 'T', and x=8 is '1' (snake #1's head). Then at y=5, x=3 is 'T', y=4, x=3 is '2' (my head), and y=3, x=2 is 'A', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The 'T's might represent another snake's body parts. So maybe there's a snake starting at (6,6) going downward. Let me check:\n\nAt y=6: x=6 is 'T', x=7 is 'T', x=8 is '1' (snake #1's head).\n\nAt y=5: x=3 is 'T', so perhaps that's a different snake's body.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the board correctly.\n\nLooking at y=6: the line is \". . T T . . . 1 .\", meaning at x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: T, x=4: T, x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: 1, x=9: .\n\nSimilarly, at y=5: the line is \". . T . . . . . .\", meaning x=3 is T.\n\nAt y=4: \". . . 2 . . . . .\", so x=3 is 2.\n\nSo snake #2 (me) is at (3,4). There's a 'T' at (3,5), which must be part of another snake. So, perhaps snake #6 is at (6,6), with body parts at (6,5), (6,4), and (3,4). Wait, that would mean that (3,4) is the tail of snake #6, but I'm at (3,4), which is my head. That can't be right because a snake can't occupy the same position as another snake unless they collide. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'T's are apples or something else. Or maybe 'T' represents another snake's body. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe problem says that enemy snakes are:\n\n- Snake #1 is at (8,6) with body at [].\n\nSo snake #1's head is at (8,6), and it has no body parts listed, meaning it's just the head. Then, at y=6, x=6 and x=7 are 'T's, which might be another snake.\n\nBut the problem didn't mention other snakes except for snake #1. Wait, the initial description says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n\n* Snake #1 is at position (8,6) with body at []\n\nBoard state:\n\n...\"\n\nWait, maybe the 'T's are part of another snake, but the problem only specifies snake #1. So perhaps snake #1 has a body extending from (8,6) downward? But the board shows at y=6, x=6 and x=7 as 'T's, and at y=5, x=3 as 'T'.\n\nI think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me focus on what's given:\n\nMy snake is at (3,4). The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), (9,2). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,6).\n\nSo, I need to decide my next move. I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving UP would take me to (3,5). Moving DOWN would be to (3,3). LEFT to (2,4). RIGHT to (4,4).\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (3,2), which is two moves DOWN (to (3,3) and (3,2)). Alternatively, (2,3) is one LEFT and one UP from (3,4): (2,4) then (2,3). Similarly, (4,2) is to the RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nWait, but I'm at (3,4). Let's check for possible obstacles.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,5), is that safe? The enemy snake is at (8,6), so not nearby. Are there any other snakes there? At (3,5), the board shows a 'T', which might be a body part of another snake. Wait, the board at y=5, x=3 is 'T', so if I move UP, I would land on (3,5), which is 'T', perhaps part of another snake. That might be dangerous because if 'T' is part of another snake, moving there could cause a collision, killing me.\n\nSimilarly, moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe, as I don't see any enemy there.Moving RIGHT to (4,4) is safe, as I don't see any enemy there. Moving DOWN to (3,3) would take me to an apple at (3,2) next.\n\nBut moving to (3,5) is risky because of the 'T' there. Maybe that's part of another snake.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the enemy snakes are only snake #1 at (8,6) with no body parts. So perhaps the 'T's are just parts of the board, not snakes. Or maybe they're apples or something else. Wait, no, the apples are marked as 'A's, so 'T's must be something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'T's are obstacles or part of another game element, but the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to ignore them or assume they're just part of the board and not snakes.\n\nGiven that, I can proceed with moving towards the nearest apple.\n\nThe apples are at (3,2), which is two moves DOWN, but perhaps I can get there quickly. Alternatively, (2,3) is one LEFT and one UP. Let's see which path is safer.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3), I can collect that apple. That seems safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN twice to (3,2) is also possible.\n\nI should also consider where the enemy snake is. Snake #1 is at (8,6). If I move towards (2,3), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good. If I go towards (3,2), I'm also moving away.\n\nBut perhaps the closer apple is at (3,2), so moving DOWN twice would be better.\n\nWait, let me check the coordinates again. From (3,4), moving DOWN once takes me to (3,3), and then to (3,2). So two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT once to (2,4), then UP once to (2,3) is also two moves.\n\nBut (2,3) is an apple, and moving there might be safer because I can turn UP directly into an apple, whereas going DOWN to (3,2) might put me closer to the enemy if they move downward.\n\nWait, the enemy at (8,6) is quite far from (3,2), so maybe it's safe. Alternatively, moving to (2,3) might be more strategic because it's a different area.\n\nI think moving to (2,3) might be better because it's an apple and moving there gets me away from the enemy's potential path.\n\nSo, the plan is: move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3) to collect the apple. But my next move should be LEFT to (2,4).\n\nWait, but I can only move once per turn. So next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, let's check if moving LEFT is safe. At (2,4), is there any obstruction? From the board, y=4, x=2 is a dot, so it's clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move UP to (3,5), but as y=5, x=3 is 'T', which might be an obstruction or another snake, so it's risky.\n\nSo, I think the best move is LEFT towards (2,4), heading towards the apple at (2,3).\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's an apple closer. From (3,4), the apple at (3,2) is two moves down, which is manageable, but the apple at (2,3) is closer in terms of steps (two moves: LEFT and UP).\n\nAlternatively, I could go RIGHT to (4,4) and then DOWN to (4,3), which is near (4,2). But that's three moves: RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN again.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (2,4) and then UP to (2,3) seems more efficient.\n\nYes, I think moving LEFT is the best next move.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the apple at (2,3), I will move LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,3) in subsequent moves. This path avoids potential conflicts with the enemy snake and efficiently collects an apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (1,4). The apples are at (4,2), (3,2), (0,1), (2,3), and (9,2). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (8,8) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head, so not much of a threat right now.\n\nFrom the last move, I was moving LEFT, so I went from (2,4) to (1,4). My rationale was to head towards the apple at (2,3). But wait, I'm at (1,4) now, so moving left would take me to (0,4). But there's an apple at (0,1), which is quite a distance. Alternatively, maybe I should check the other apples nearby.\n\nLooking at the apples again: (2,3) is the closest one. My current position is (1,4). To reach (2,3), I should go RIGHT from (1,4) to (2,4), and then maybe DOWN to (2,3). But if I move right now, I can head towards that apple.\n\nWait, but before that, I should make sure I'm not going to run into myself, another snake, or a wall. The only other snake is at (8,8), which is far away, so collision with it isn't an immediate concern.\n\nLooking at my own body. If my snake's body was at (2,4) before moving to (1,4), moving right to (2,4) again might cause a collision with my own body if I don't grow. Wait, but if I move to (2,4), which was my previous position, would that cause a problem? Or is my body following behind me? Hmm, in snake games, the body follows, so if I'm moving forward, my head moves, and the body parts follow each segment. So unless I turn around, I shouldn't hit my own body.\n\nWait, but my last move was LEFT from (2,4) to (1,4), and I was planning to go towards (2,3). So my body is probably at (2,4) or maybe trailing. So moving right now might not be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check where my body is. But in the given information, the snake positions show just the head positions. From the last move, I was moving left to (1,4), and before that, I was at (2,4). So if my snake is of length 1, meaning just the head, moving right to (2,4) is fine. Since I don't have any other body segments, I don't have to worry about hitting myself.\n\nSo, the target is the apple at (2,3). To get there from (1,4), I can move RIGHT to (2,4), then DOWN to (2,3), which would be the apple. So the next move should be RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, are there any other apples closer? Let me calculate the distances. The distance from (1,4) to (2,3) is sqrt((2-1)^2 + (3-4)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) \u22481.414. To (3,2): from (1,4) it's sqrt( (3-1)^2 + (2-4)^2 )= sqrt(4+4)=sqrt(8)=2.828. To (4,2): even farther. The apple at (0,1) is also far, sqrt( (0-1)^2 + (1-4)^2 )=sqrt(1+9)=sqrt(10)\u22483.162. The apple at (2,3) is the closest.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (2,4) and then DOWN to (2,3) makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, could I move DOWN first and then RIGHT? Let's see: from (1,4), moving DOWN would take me to (1,3). Then moving RIGHT to (2,3) would get me to the apple. That might also work.\n\nWait, but if I move DOWN now, I go to (1,3), but then the next move would be RIGHT to (2,3). So moving DOWN now might require an extra move, but perhaps it's safer. Alternatively, moving RIGHT first, then DOWN. Both approaches get me to the apple in two moves, so it's a matter of which path is safer.\n\nLet me check the board for any obstacles. The apples are at various points, but the only other snake is far away. So moving right or down first might not matter in terms of immediate threats. However, maybe moving DOWN first would make me closer to the apple at (0,1), but that's still far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (2,4) first is better because it's a stepping stone towards the apple at (2,3). So for the next move, moving RIGHT would be the correct direction.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I was moving LEFT towards (1,4), trying to approach (2,3). Now, moving RIGHT would make sense to get closer to (2,3). So the next move should be RIGHT.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall. My current position is (1,4). Moving right would increase x by 1, taking me to (2,4), which is within the board (since x can be from 0 to 9). So that's safe.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move will be RIGHT to approach the nearest apple at (2,3) safely.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
