Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) and then right twice to (2,7), but that might not be as direct.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (7,5) with an empty body, but I don't know where it's going. It might not interfere with me right now since I'm on the opposite side of the board. So probably safe to go after the apple at (1,8).\n\nBut moving right to (1,6) is the first step.

The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). Let me assess my situation and plan the next move.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (1,6), so looking at the board, that's in the second column (since x=1) and the seventh row from the bottom. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), which is two rows above me, and possibly (1,3), which is three rows below me. Alternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), which is further away both in columns and rows.\n\nI should prioritize the closest apple to minimize the number of moves and avoid potential threats. The apple at (1,8) is directly above me, two rows up. That seems like the most straightforward path without any obstacles. Moving up from (1,6) to (1,7) and then to (1,8) would allow me to eat the apple in two moves. \n\nI should also consider any potential threats. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). Since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it seems unlikely that snake #1 will interfere with my path to (1,8). There are no other snakes mentioned, so the main concern is avoiding walls and myself.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (5,5), but that would require moving right four times and then down once. This would take more moves and might put me at risk of collision with the enemy snake or walls. Therefore, it's not the optimal path.\n\nI should also be cautious about moving too far left or right, as that could lead me into walls. Since I'm at x=1, moving left would take me to x=0, which is the edge of the board. It's safer to stay in the right direction towards higher x values if needed, but in this case, moving up is the better choice.\n\nSo, the plan is to move up to (1,7) first. Once there, I can then move up again to (1,8) and eat the apple, growing my snake and gaining a point. This path is direct and avoids any immediate dangers.\n\nI should also think about my next move after eating the apple. Once I've eaten, I'll have to decide whether to go after another apple or avoid potential threats. But for now, focusing on reaching (1,8) is the priority.\n\nIn summary, moving up to (1,7) is the next logical step towards reaching the apple at (1,8). I should execute this move to get closer to my target without any obstacles in the way.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (1,8), I'll move up to (1,7), bringing me one step closer. This path is direct and avoids any immediate threats, allowing me to progress towards my goal efficiently.\n\nNext move: UP"

The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). Let me assess my situation and plan the next move.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (1,6), so looking at the board, that's in the second column (since x=1) and the seventh row from the bottom. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), which is two rows above me, and possibly (1,3), which is three rows below me. Alternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), which is further away both in columns and rows.\n\nI should prioritize the closest apple to minimize the number of moves and avoid potential threats. The apple at (1,8) is directly above me, two rows up. That seems like the most straightforward path without any obstacles. Moving up from (1,6) to (1,7) and then to (1,8) would allow me to eat the apple in two moves. \n\nI should also consider any potential threats. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). Since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it seems unlikely that snake #1 will interfere with my path to (1,8). There are no other snakes mentioned, so the main concern is avoiding walls and myself.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (5,5), but that would require moving right four times and then down once. This would take more moves and might put me at risk of collision with the enemy snake or walls. Therefore, it's not the optimal path.\n\nI should also be cautious about moving too far left or right, as that could lead me into walls. Since I'm at x=1, moving left would take me to x=0, which is the edge of the board. It's safer to stay in the right direction towards higher x values if needed, but in this case, moving up is the better choice.\n\nSo, the plan is to move up to (1,7) first. Once there, I can then move up again to (1,8) and eat the apple, growing my snake and gaining a point. This path is direct and avoids any immediate dangers.\n\nI should also think about my next move after eating the apple. Once I've eaten, I'll have to decide whether to go after another apple or avoid potential threats. But for now, focusing on reaching (1,8) is the priority.\n\nIn summary, moving up to (1,7) is the next logical step towards reaching the apple at (1,8). I should execute this move to get closer to my target without any obstacles in the way.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (1,8), I'll move up to (1,7), bringing me one step closer. This path is direct and avoids any immediate threats, allowing me to progress towards my goal efficiently.\n\nNext move: UP"

Since the board goes from y=0 to y=9, my current y-coordinate is 7. Moving UP to y=8 is still within the board, so that's safe. The next move after that would be to y=9, but I should check if there's an apple there.

I should just proceed with moving UP.\n\nI don't think I need to plan beyond that for now because my immediate goal is to eat the apple at (1,8). After that, I can reassess the board and decide the next steps, maybe going after another apple or avoiding the enemy snake if necessary.\n\nIn summary, moving UP to (1,8) is the correct next move.

My goal is to get to an apple to grow and gain points without dying. Let me think about what my options are.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is at the bottom left corner at (0,6). That means it's on the leftmost column, so moving left isn't possible because I'll go out of bounds and die. So my possible moves are up, right, or down. But wait, down from (0,6) would take me to (0,5), which is still in bounds. Right would take me to (1,6), and up would take me to (0,7). \n\nNow, let me check where the apples are. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), (1,3), and (5,5). But I'm at (0,6). So moving right to (1,6) would put me closer to the apple at (1,8) or (1,3). Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) would still have me on the left edge, which isn't helpful because the apples are either to the right or up higher but to the right as well.\n\nI should probably head towards the apple at (1,8) because it's the closest in terms of columns. But I'm two rows below that. Alternatively, the apple at (1,3) is even further down. Wait, maybe I should check the distances better.\n\nWait, (1,8) is two units up from my current position if I move right once. So moving right to (1,6) and then possibly up to (1,7) and then (1,8). That's a plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) and then right twice to (2,7), but that might not be as direct.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (7,5) with an empty body, but I don't know where it's going. It might not interfere with me right now since I'm on the opposite side of the board. So probably safe to go after the apple at (1,8).\n\nBut moving right to (1,6) is the first step. Let me think if there are any obstacles. The apples are at (1,8), so if I move right to (1,6), I can then move up to (1,7) and then up to (1,8) to eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's further away, so maybe not the best choice right now.\n\nWait, no, (5,5) is in the middle, but I'm at (0,6), so moving to (5,5) would require moving right five times and down once, which might take more steps, and maybe the enemy snake could interfere. Whereas (1,8) is just two steps up from (1,6).\n\nSo I think the best move is to move right to (1,6), then up to (1,7), then up to (1,8) to eat the apple. That seems manageable and the closest apple. So I should start by moving right.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (1,8), I'll move right to (1,6), bringing me closer to the target.

But reaching them requires me to cross the path followed by enemy Snake #2, which might not be a good idea.\n\nAnother alternative is the apple at (5, 5) which is 3 steps down and 3 steps to the left. Since Snake #2 is relatively further up, this approach seems likely to be safer for now and gives me more flexibility to navigate the board.\n\nMy strategy for the next move should be reaching the apple at (5, 5) without crossing the path of the enemy snake.

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let me think through my next move step by step. My snake is currently at (1,8), and I just ate an apple here, so I've grown longer. The apples available now are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My last move was UP, which got me to (1,8). \n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly below me. My snake's body is currently at positions [(1,8), (1,7)], assuming I moved up from (1,7). I need to decide whether to go down towards (1,3) or perhaps move sideways to reach another apple.\n\nGoing straight down to (1,3) seems the most straightforward path. Since my body is behind me, I don't have to worry about hitting myself if I go down. But I should check if the path is clear. Moving from (1,8) to (1,7) is my previous position, which is safe. Then to (1,6), (1,5), etc., down to (1,3). That seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right towards (5,5), but that's quite a distance and might not be efficient. Also, moving left from (1,8) isn't possible because x=1 is the leftmost column; moving left would take me to x=0, but that's still at (1,8) moving left, wait no\u2014coordinates are (x,y), so moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8). Is that a good idea? Well, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's not directly in the left direction. Maybe not the best move.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). That's far from my current position, so no immediate threat.\n\nSo, my best strategy is to head down towards (1,3). To do that, I need to change direction from UP to DOWN. Wait, no, because moving down from (1,8) would be decreasing the y-coordinate, which is correct. So, I would start moving DOWN each turn until I reach (1,3).\n\nBut I should also be cautious about my own body. If I move down to (1,7), which is where I was before, that's part of my body now. Wait, when I moved up to (1,8), my body would have followed. So, my snake's body is at (1,8) and (1,7). Moving down to (1,7) would mean I'm trying to go back into my own body, which would cause me to die. Oh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move down immediately because that would make me run into my own body. I need to change direction. Maybe I should move right to (2,8) and then proceed down from there. Let me think about this.\n\nIf I move RIGHT from (1,8) to (2,8), that's a new position, and my body would follow: [ (1,8), (1,7) ]. Then, from (2,8), I can start moving down towards (2,3), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving right to (5,8) but that's not an apple either. The apples are at (5,5), which is down and to the right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT to (0,8). Is that a wall? No, walls are at x=0 and y=0. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9), so x=0 is the leftmost, y=0 is the bottom. So moving left from (1,8) to (0,8) is possible, but there's no apple there. So that might not be helpful unless I'm trying to loop around, which seems inefficient.\n\nSo, my options after (1,8) are limited. I can't go down because I'd hit my own body. I can go left or right. Let me check if moving right to (2,8) is safe and if I can then plan a path towards an apple without hitting my body.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,8), my snake's body would be at (1,8), (1,7). Then, from (2,8), I could move DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), etc., heading towards (5,5). But that's a long way. Alternatively, after moving to (2,8), I could move LEFT back to (1,8), but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then down to (0,3), but again, no apple there. Maybe moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then DOWN towards (2,3), but that's not an apple either. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5). That's an apple, so maybe that's a path.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I might run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can wait for the enemy snake to move or for another apple to appear, but that's not strategic.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial assessment. When I moved UP to (1,8), my body followed, so now my snake is from (1,8) to (1,7). To move down, I need to go to (1,7), which is part of my body. So I can't move DOWN. Therefore, I must move either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,8), my body would extend to (1,8), (1,7), and then next move I can go DOWN from (2,8) to (2,7), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't seem beneficial.\n\nSo, the best move is to go RIGHT to (2,8) to avoid hitting my own body and then plan to move towards the apple at (5,5) or (9,2). But that's a bit of a detour. Alternatively, I could consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then DOWN towards (0,3), but that doesn't help me reach any apple sooner.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple at (9,2) is another option. If I move RIGHT from (2,8) towards (9,8), then down to (9,2), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then right to (3,8), etc., but again, not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just go LEFT to (0,8) and then see if I can loop around, but that might take too many moves. Alternatively, maybe I should just go RIGHT and then find a path towards an apple.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another apple at (2,0), which is to the left and down. But from (1,8), moving down is blocked by my body. So I can't go that way immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should stay put and change direction, but that doesn't make sense because I need to keep moving.\n\nWait, no, I have to move in a direction every turn. So, the only options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but DOWN is into my body, so I can't do that. So I have to choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nConsidering that, moving RIGHT to (2,8) seems the better option because it allows me to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) eventually. Moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't lead me towards any apple directly.\n\nSo, my next move should be RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, I can start moving down towards (5,5).\n\nWait, but from (2,8), moving down would take me to (2,7), (2,6), etc., which isn't directly towards (5,5). To get to (5,5), I need to move right and down. So, perhaps after moving to (2,8), I should then move RIGHT again to (3,8), then to (4,8), and so on, until I reach (5,8), and then move down to (5,5). But that's a lot of moves and I might run into my own body.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better strategy is to move RIGHT, then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., in a diagonal path towards (5,5). But I'm not sure if that's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just go to (5,8) and then down, but that's assuming I can get there without hitting my body.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (2,8). Now, my body is at (1,8) and (1,7).\n2. From (2,8), move DOWN to (2,7).\n3. Then move RIGHT to (3,7).\n4. Then DOWN to (3,6).\n5. Continue this pattern until I reach (5,5).\n\nBut that might take too many steps and I could potentially run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT all the way to (5,8) and then DOWN to (5,5). That would take fewer steps but might be riskier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move RIGHT once to get to (2,8), then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., towards (5,5). But I think that would work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nNext move: RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, start moving towards (5,5) by moving DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own body. After moving to (2,8), my body will be at (2,8), (1,8), (1,7). Then, moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe because (2,7) is not occupied yet. Then, moving RIGHT to (3,7) is also safe. Continue this way towards (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I reach (5,8) directly, I can then move DOWN to (5,5) without any issues, but that would require moving RIGHT four times first, from (2,8) to (6,8), which seems too far and possibly into enemy territory.\n\nWait, where is the enemy snake? Snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). So, if I go towards (5,5), I'm moving away from the enemy. That should be safe.\n\nSo, the best next move is to go RIGHT to (2,8), then start moving towards (5,5) by going DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nAnother thing to consider: If I eat the apple at (5,5), I'll grow longer, which might make it harder to maneuver. But that's a good problem to have because it means I'm gaining points.\n\nSo, to summarize, the immediate next move is RIGHT to (2,8), and then proceed towards (5,5) while avoiding my own body.\n</think>\n\nThe next move should be to the RIGHT to position (2,8), allowing the snake to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) while avoiding its own body.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

My goal is to get to an apple to grow and gain points without dying. Let me think about what my options are.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is at the bottom left corner at (0,6). That means it's on the leftmost column, so moving left isn't possible because I'll go out of bounds and die. So my possible moves are up, right, or down. But wait, down from (0,6) would take me to (0,5), which is still in bounds. Right would take me to (1,6), and up would take me to (0,7). \n\nNow, let me check where the apples are. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), (1,3), and (5,5). But I'm at (0,6). So moving right to (1,6) would put me closer to the apple at (1,8) or (1,3). Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) would still have me on the left edge, which isn't helpful because the apples are either to the right or up higher but to the right as well.\n\nI should probably head towards the apple at (1,8) because it's the closest in terms of columns. But I'm two rows below that. Alternatively, the apple at (1,3) is even further down. Wait, maybe I should check the distances better.\n\nWait, (1,8) is two units up from my current position if I move right once. So moving right to (1,6) and then possibly up to (1,7) and then (1,8). That's a plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) and then right twice to (2,7), but that might not be as direct.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (7,5) with an empty body, but I don't know where it's going. It might not interfere with me right now since I'm on the opposite side of the board. So probably safe to go after the apple at (1,8).\n\nBut moving right to (1,6) is the first step. Let me think if there are any obstacles. The apples are at (1,8), so if I move right to (1,6), I can then move up to (1,7) and then up to (1,8) to eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's further away, so maybe not the best choice right now.\n\nWait, no, (5,5) is in the middle, but I'm at (0,6), so moving to (5,5) would require moving right five times and down once, which might take more steps, and maybe the enemy snake could interfere. Whereas (1,8) is just two steps up from (1,6).\n\nSo I think the best move is to move right to (1,6), then up to (1,7), then up to (1,8) to eat the apple. That seems manageable and the closest apple. So I should start by moving right.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (1,8), I'll move right to (1,6), bringing me closer to the target. This avoids walls and potential collisions, allowing me to proceed towards the apple efficiently.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

But reaching them requires me to cross the path followed by enemy Snake #2, which might not be a good idea.\n\nAnother alternative is the apple at (5, 5) which is 3 steps down and 3 steps to the left. Since Snake #2 is relatively further up, this approach seems likely to be safer for now and gives me more flexibility to navigate the board.\n\nMy strategy for the next move should be reaching the apple at (5, 5) without crossing the path of the enemy snake.

The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). Let me assess my situation and plan the next move.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (1,6), so looking at the board, that's in the second column (since x=1) and the seventh row from the bottom. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), which is two rows above me, and possibly (1,3), which is three rows below me. Alternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), which is further away both in columns and rows.\n\nI should prioritize the closest apple to minimize the number of moves and avoid potential threats. The apple at (1,8) is directly above me, two rows up. That seems like the most straightforward path without any obstacles. Moving up from (1,6) to (1,7) and then to (1,8) would allow me to eat the apple in two moves. \n\nI should also consider any potential threats. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). Since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it seems unlikely that snake #1 will interfere with my path to (1,8). There are no other snakes mentioned, so the main concern is avoiding walls and myself.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (5,5), but that would require moving right four times and then down once. This would take more moves and might put me at risk of collision with the enemy snake or walls. Therefore, it's not the optimal path.\n\nI should also be cautious about moving too far left or right, as that could lead me into walls. Since I'm at x=1, moving left would take me to x=0, which is the edge of the board. It's safer to stay in the right direction towards higher x values if needed, but in this case, moving up is the better choice.\n\nSo, the plan is to move up to (1,7) first. Once there, I can then move up again to (1,8) and eat the apple, growing my snake and gaining a point. This path is direct and avoids any immediate dangers.\n\nI should also think about my next move after eating the apple. Once I've eaten, I'll have to decide whether to go after another apple or avoid potential threats. But for now, focusing on reaching (1,8) is the priority.\n\nIn summary, moving up to (1,7) is the next logical step towards reaching the apple at (1,8). I should execute this move to get closer to my target without any obstacles in the way.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (1,8), I'll move up to (1,7), bringing me one step closer.

However, the apple at position (5, 5) is now even closer, which means fewer moves and less risk. \n\nContrasting last time, the snake is posing less of a threat and there is now nothing obstructing the path towards the apple at position (5, 5). Nevertheless, I should be cautious of the position of the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Now, I need to plan my next move to get closer to the apple at (1,8). \n\nLet me check the board state again. The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My position after moving UP from (1,6) to (1,7) puts me one step away from the apple at (1,8). That's great because I can eat it in the next move without any obstacles in the way.\n\nNow, I should consider if there's any immediate danger. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). That's pretty far from my current position, so I don't think I'll be in any danger from them right now. My main focus is to reach the apple at (1,8) without hitting any walls or my own body.\n\nI need to make sure that moving UP again won't cause me to hit a wall. Since the board goes from y=0 to y=9, my current y-coordinate is 7. Moving UP to y=8 is still within the board, so that's safe. The next move after that would be to y=9, but I should check if there's an apple there. Wait, the apple is at (1,8), so once I reach y=8, I'll eat the apple and grow, which is the goal.\n\nSo, the next logical move is to go UP again to (1,8) and eat the apple. There's no need to change direction or worry about anything else since the path is clear. I should just proceed with moving UP.\n\nI don't think I need to plan beyond that for now because my immediate goal is to eat the apple at (1,8). After that, I can reassess the board and decide the next steps, maybe going after another apple or avoiding the enemy snake if necessary.\n\nIn summary, moving UP to (1,8) is the correct next move. It's straightforward, safe, and allows me to gain a point by eating the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

Plus, moving UP also gives me further clearance to move towards either the apple at (9, 6) or (5, 5) depending on the enemy's move.\n\nTaking into account all the aforementioned analysis, my best bet would be to go UP. While initially, this route may take a move more, it's the safer and strategically more viable choice.\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let me think through my next move step by step. My snake is currently at (1,8), and I just ate an apple here, so I've grown longer. The apples available now are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My last move was UP, which got me to (1,8). \n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly below me. My snake's body is currently at positions [(1,8), (1,7)], assuming I moved up from (1,7). I need to decide whether to go down towards (1,3) or perhaps move sideways to reach another apple.\n\nGoing straight down to (1,3) seems the most straightforward path. Since my body is behind me, I don't have to worry about hitting myself if I go down. But I should check if the path is clear. Moving from (1,8) to (1,7) is my previous position, which is safe. Then to (1,6), (1,5), etc., down to (1,3). That seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right towards (5,5), but that's quite a distance and might not be efficient. Also, moving left from (1,8) isn't possible because x=1 is the leftmost column; moving left would take me to x=0, but that's still at (1,8) moving left, wait no\u2014coordinates are (x,y), so moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8). Is that a good idea? Well, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's not directly in the left direction. Maybe not the best move.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). That's far from my current position, so no immediate threat.\n\nSo, my best strategy is to head down towards (1,3). To do that, I need to change direction from UP to DOWN. Wait, no, because moving down from (1,8) would be decreasing the y-coordinate, which is correct. So, I would start moving DOWN each turn until I reach (1,3).\n\nBut I should also be cautious about my own body. If I move down to (1,7), which is where I was before, that's part of my body now. Wait, when I moved up to (1,8), my body would have followed. So, my snake's body is at (1,8) and (1,7). Moving down to (1,7) would mean I'm trying to go back into my own body, which would cause me to die. Oh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move down immediately because that would make me run into my own body. I need to change direction. Maybe I should move right to (2,8) and then proceed down from there. Let me think about this.\n\nIf I move RIGHT from (1,8) to (2,8), that's a new position, and my body would follow: [ (1,8), (1,7) ]. Then, from (2,8), I can start moving down towards (2,3), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving right to (5,8) but that's not an apple either. The apples are at (5,5), which is down and to the right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT to (0,8). Is that a wall? No, walls are at x=0 and y=0. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9), so x=0 is the leftmost, y=0 is the bottom. So moving left from (1,8) to (0,8) is possible, but there's no apple there. So that might not be helpful unless I'm trying to loop around, which seems inefficient.\n\nSo, my options after (1,8) are limited. I can't go down because I'd hit my own body. I can go left or right. Let me check if moving right to (2,8) is safe and if I can then plan a path towards an apple without hitting my body.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,8), my snake's body would be at (1,8), (1,7). Then, from (2,8), I could move DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), etc., heading towards (5,5). But that's a long way. Alternatively, after moving to (2,8), I could move LEFT back to (1,8), but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then down to (0,3), but again, no apple there. Maybe moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then DOWN towards (2,3), but that's not an apple either. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5). That's an apple, so maybe that's a path.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I might run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can wait for the enemy snake to move or for another apple to appear, but that's not strategic.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial assessment. When I moved UP to (1,8), my body followed, so now my snake is from (1,8) to (1,7). To move down, I need to go to (1,7), which is part of my body. So I can't move DOWN. Therefore, I must move either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,8), my body would extend to (1,8), (1,7), and then next move I can go DOWN from (2,8) to (2,7), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't seem beneficial.\n\nSo, the best move is to go RIGHT to (2,8) to avoid hitting my own body and then plan to move towards the apple at (5,5) or (9,2). But that's a bit of a detour. Alternatively, I could consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then DOWN towards (0,3), but that doesn't help me reach any apple sooner.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple at (9,2) is another option. If I move RIGHT from (2,8) towards (9,8), then down to (9,2), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then right to (3,8), etc., but again, not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just go LEFT to (0,8) and then see if I can loop around, but that might take too many moves. Alternatively, maybe I should just go RIGHT and then find a path towards an apple.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another apple at (2,0), which is to the left and down. But from (1,8), moving down is blocked by my body. So I can't go that way immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should stay put and change direction, but that doesn't make sense because I need to keep moving.\n\nWait, no, I have to move in a direction every turn. So, the only options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but DOWN is into my body, so I can't do that. So I have to choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nConsidering that, moving RIGHT to (2,8) seems the better option because it allows me to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) eventually. Moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't lead me towards any apple directly.\n\nSo, my next move should be RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, I can start moving down towards (5,5).\n\nWait, but from (2,8), moving down would take me to (2,7), (2,6), etc., which isn't directly towards (5,5). To get to (5,5), I need to move right and down. So, perhaps after moving to (2,8), I should then move RIGHT again to (3,8), then to (4,8), and so on, until I reach (5,8), and then move down to (5,5). But that's a lot of moves and I might run into my own body.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better strategy is to move RIGHT, then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., in a diagonal path towards (5,5). But I'm not sure if that's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just go to (5,8) and then down, but that's assuming I can get there without hitting my body.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (2,8). Now, my body is at (1,8) and (1,7).\n2. From (2,8), move DOWN to (2,7).\n3. Then move RIGHT to (3,7).\n4. Then DOWN to (3,6).\n5. Continue this pattern until I reach (5,5).\n\nBut that might take too many steps and I could potentially run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT all the way to (5,8) and then DOWN to (5,5). That would take fewer steps but might be riskier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move RIGHT once to get to (2,8), then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., towards (5,5). But I think that would work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nNext move: RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, start moving towards (5,5) by moving DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own body. After moving to (2,8), my body will be at (2,8), (1,8), (1,7). Then, moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe because (2,7) is not occupied yet. Then, moving RIGHT to (3,7) is also safe. Continue this way towards (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I reach (5,8) directly, I can then move DOWN to (5,5) without any issues, but that would require moving RIGHT four times first, from (2,8) to (6,8), which seems too far and possibly into enemy territory.\n\nWait, where is the enemy snake? Snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). So, if I go towards (5,5), I'm moving away from the enemy. That should be safe.\n\nSo, the best next move is to go RIGHT to (2,8), then start moving towards (5,5) by going DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nAnother thing to consider: If I eat the apple at (5,5), I'll grow longer, which might make it harder to maneuver. But that's a good problem to have because it means I'm gaining points.\n\nSo, to summarize, the immediate next move is RIGHT to (2,8), and then proceed towards (5,5) while avoiding my own body.\n</think>\n\nThe next move should be to the RIGHT to position (2,8), allowing the snake to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) while avoiding its own body.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

My goal is to get to an apple to grow and gain points without dying. Let me think about what my options are.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is at the bottom left corner at (0,6). That means it's on the leftmost column, so moving left isn't possible because I'll go out of bounds and die. So my possible moves are up, right, or down. But wait, down from (0,6) would take me to (0,5), which is still in bounds. Right would take me to (1,6), and up would take me to (0,7). \n\nNow, let me check where the apples are. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), (1,3), and (5,5). But I'm at (0,6). So moving right to (1,6) would put me closer to the apple at (1,8) or (1,3). Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) would still have me on the left edge, which isn't helpful because the apples are either to the right or up higher but to the right as well.\n\nI should probably head towards the apple at (1,8) because it's the closest in terms of columns. But I'm two rows below that. Alternatively, the apple at (1,3) is even further down. Wait, maybe I should check the distances better.\n\nWait, (1,8) is two units up from my current position if I move right once. So moving right to (1,6) and then possibly up to (1,7) and then (1,8). That's a plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) and then right twice to (2,7), but that might not be as direct.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (7,5) with an empty body, but I don't know where it's going. It might not interfere with me right now since I'm on the opposite side of the board. So probably safe to go after the apple at (1,8).\n\nBut moving right to (1,6) is the first step. Let me think if there are any obstacles. The apples are at (1,8), so if I move right to (1,6), I can then move up to (1,7) and then up to (1,8) to eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's further away, so maybe not the best choice right now.\n\nWait, no, (5,5) is in the middle, but I'm at (0,6), so moving to (5,5) would require moving right five times and down once, which might take more steps, and maybe the enemy snake could interfere. Whereas (1,8) is just two steps up from (1,6).\n\nSo I think the best move is to move right to (1,6), then up to (1,7), then up to (1,8) to eat the apple. That seems manageable and the closest apple. So I should start by moving right.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (1,8), I'll move right to (1,6), bringing me closer to the target. This avoids walls and potential collisions, allowing me to proceed towards the apple efficiently.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

But reaching them requires me to cross the path followed by enemy Snake #2, which might not be a good idea.\n\nAnother alternative is the apple at (5, 5) which is 3 steps down and 3 steps to the left. Since Snake #2 is relatively further up, this approach seems likely to be safer for now and gives me more flexibility to navigate the board.\n\nMy strategy for the next move should be reaching the apple at (5, 5) without crossing the path of the enemy snake.

The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). Let me assess my situation and plan the next move.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (1,6), so looking at the board, that's in the second column (since x=1) and the seventh row from the bottom. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), which is two rows above me, and possibly (1,3), which is three rows below me. Alternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), which is further away both in columns and rows.\n\nI should prioritize the closest apple to minimize the number of moves and avoid potential threats. The apple at (1,8) is directly above me, two rows up. That seems like the most straightforward path without any obstacles. Moving up from (1,6) to (1,7) and then to (1,8) would allow me to eat the apple in two moves. \n\nI should also consider any potential threats. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). Since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it seems unlikely that snake #1 will interfere with my path to (1,8). There are no other snakes mentioned, so the main concern is avoiding walls and myself.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (5,5), but that would require moving right four times and then down once. This would take more moves and might put me at risk of collision with the enemy snake or walls. Therefore, it's not the optimal path.\n\nI should also be cautious about moving too far left or right, as that could lead me into walls. Since I'm at x=1, moving left would take me to x=0, which is the edge of the board. It's safer to stay in the right direction towards higher x values if needed, but in this case, moving up is the better choice.\n\nSo, the plan is to move up to (1,7) first. Once there, I can then move up again to (1,8) and eat the apple, growing my snake and gaining a point. This path is direct and avoids any immediate dangers.\n\nI should also think about my next move after eating the apple. Once I've eaten, I'll have to decide whether to go after another apple or avoid potential threats. But for now, focusing on reaching (1,8) is the priority.\n\nIn summary, moving up to (1,7) is the next logical step towards reaching the apple at (1,8). I should execute this move to get closer to my target without any obstacles in the way.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (1,8), I'll move up to (1,7), bringing me one step closer.

However, the apple at position (5, 5) is now even closer, which means fewer moves and less risk. \n\nContrasting last time, the snake is posing less of a threat and there is now nothing obstructing the path towards the apple at position (5, 5).

Now, I need to plan my next move to get closer to the apple at (1,8). \n\nLet me check the board state again. The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My position after moving UP from (1,6) to (1,7) puts me one step away from the apple at (1,8). That's great because I can eat it in the next move without any obstacles in the way.\n\nNow, I should consider if there's any immediate danger. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). That's pretty far from my current position, so I don't think I'll be in any danger from them right now. My main focus is to reach the apple at (1,8) without hitting any walls or my own body.\n\nI need to make sure that moving UP again won't cause me to hit a wall. Since the board goes from y=0 to y=9, my current y-coordinate is 7. Moving UP to y=8 is still within the board, so that's safe. The next move after that would be to y=9, but I should check if there's an apple there. Wait, the apple is at (1,8), so once I reach y=8, I'll eat the apple and grow, which is the goal.\n\nSo, the next logical move is to go UP again to (1,8) and eat the apple. There's no need to change direction or worry about anything else since the path is clear. I should just proceed with moving UP.\n\nI don't think I need to plan beyond that for now because my immediate goal is to eat the apple at (1,8). After that, I can reassess the board and decide the next steps, maybe going after another apple or avoiding the enemy snake if necessary.\n\nIn summary, moving UP to (1,8) is the correct next move.

Plus, moving UP also gives me further clearance to move towards either the apple at (9, 6) or (5, 5) depending on the enemy's move.\n\nTaking into account all the aforementioned analysis, my best bet would be to go UP. While initially, this route may take a move more, it's the safer and strategically more viable choice.\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let me think through my next move step by step. My snake is currently at (1,8), and I just ate an apple here, so I've grown longer. The apples available now are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My last move was UP, which got me to (1,8). \n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly below me. My snake's body is currently at positions [(1,8), (1,7)], assuming I moved up from (1,7). I need to decide whether to go down towards (1,3) or perhaps move sideways to reach another apple.\n\nGoing straight down to (1,3) seems the most straightforward path. Since my body is behind me, I don't have to worry about hitting myself if I go down. But I should check if the path is clear. Moving from (1,8) to (1,7) is my previous position, which is safe. Then to (1,6), (1,5), etc., down to (1,3). That seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right towards (5,5), but that's quite a distance and might not be efficient. Also, moving left from (1,8) isn't possible because x=1 is the leftmost column; moving left would take me to x=0, but that's still at (1,8) moving left, wait no\u2014coordinates are (x,y), so moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8). Is that a good idea? Well, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's not directly in the left direction. Maybe not the best move.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). That's far from my current position, so no immediate threat.\n\nSo, my best strategy is to head down towards (1,3). To do that, I need to change direction from UP to DOWN. Wait, no, because moving down from (1,8) would be decreasing the y-coordinate, which is correct. So, I would start moving DOWN each turn until I reach (1,3).\n\nBut I should also be cautious about my own body. If I move down to (1,7), which is where I was before, that's part of my body now. Wait, when I moved up to (1,8), my body would have followed. So, my snake's body is at (1,8) and (1,7). Moving down to (1,7) would mean I'm trying to go back into my own body, which would cause me to die. Oh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move down immediately because that would make me run into my own body. I need to change direction. Maybe I should move right to (2,8) and then proceed down from there. Let me think about this.\n\nIf I move RIGHT from (1,8) to (2,8), that's a new position, and my body would follow: [ (1,8), (1,7) ]. Then, from (2,8), I can start moving down towards (2,3), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving right to (5,8) but that's not an apple either. The apples are at (5,5), which is down and to the right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT to (0,8). Is that a wall? No, walls are at x=0 and y=0. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9), so x=0 is the leftmost, y=0 is the bottom. So moving left from (1,8) to (0,8) is possible, but there's no apple there. So that might not be helpful unless I'm trying to loop around, which seems inefficient.\n\nSo, my options after (1,8) are limited. I can't go down because I'd hit my own body. I can go left or right. Let me check if moving right to (2,8) is safe and if I can then plan a path towards an apple without hitting my body.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,8), my snake's body would be at (1,8), (1,7). Then, from (2,8), I could move DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), etc., heading towards (5,5). But that's a long way. Alternatively, after moving to (2,8), I could move LEFT back to (1,8), but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then down to (0,3), but again, no apple there. Maybe moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then DOWN towards (2,3), but that's not an apple either. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5). That's an apple, so maybe that's a path.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I might run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can wait for the enemy snake to move or for another apple to appear, but that's not strategic.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial assessment. When I moved UP to (1,8), my body followed, so now my snake is from (1,8) to (1,7). To move down, I need to go to (1,7), which is part of my body. So I can't move DOWN. Therefore, I must move either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,8), my body would extend to (1,8), (1,7), and then next move I can go DOWN from (2,8) to (2,7), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't seem beneficial.\n\nSo, the best move is to go RIGHT to (2,8) to avoid hitting my own body and then plan to move towards the apple at (5,5) or (9,2). But that's a bit of a detour. Alternatively, I could consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then DOWN towards (0,3), but that doesn't help me reach any apple sooner.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple at (9,2) is another option. If I move RIGHT from (2,8) towards (9,8), then down to (9,2), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then right to (3,8), etc., but again, not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just go LEFT to (0,8) and then see if I can loop around, but that might take too many moves. Alternatively, maybe I should just go RIGHT and then find a path towards an apple.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another apple at (2,0), which is to the left and down. But from (1,8), moving down is blocked by my body. So I can't go that way immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should stay put and change direction, but that doesn't make sense because I need to keep moving.\n\nWait, no, I have to move in a direction every turn. So, the only options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but DOWN is into my body, so I can't do that. So I have to choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nConsidering that, moving RIGHT to (2,8) seems the better option because it allows me to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) eventually. Moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't lead me towards any apple directly.\n\nSo, my next move should be RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, I can start moving down towards (5,5).\n\nWait, but from (2,8), moving down would take me to (2,7), (2,6), etc., which isn't directly towards (5,5). To get to (5,5), I need to move right and down. So, perhaps after moving to (2,8), I should then move RIGHT again to (3,8), then to (4,8), and so on, until I reach (5,8), and then move down to (5,5). But that's a lot of moves and I might run into my own body.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better strategy is to move RIGHT, then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., in a diagonal path towards (5,5). But I'm not sure if that's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just go to (5,8) and then down, but that's assuming I can get there without hitting my body.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (2,8). Now, my body is at (1,8) and (1,7).\n2. From (2,8), move DOWN to (2,7).\n3. Then move RIGHT to (3,7).\n4. Then DOWN to (3,6).\n5. Continue this pattern until I reach (5,5).\n\nBut that might take too many steps and I could potentially run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT all the way to (5,8) and then DOWN to (5,5). That would take fewer steps but might be riskier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move RIGHT once to get to (2,8), then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., towards (5,5). But I think that would work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nNext move: RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, start moving towards (5,5) by moving DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own body. After moving to (2,8), my body will be at (2,8), (1,8), (1,7). Then, moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe because (2,7) is not occupied yet. Then, moving RIGHT to (3,7) is also safe. Continue this way towards (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I reach (5,8) directly, I can then move DOWN to (5,5) without any issues, but that would require moving RIGHT four times first, from (2,8) to (6,8), which seems too far and possibly into enemy territory.\n\nWait, where is the enemy snake? Snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). So, if I go towards (5,5), I'm moving away from the enemy. That should be safe.\n\nSo, the best next move is to go RIGHT to (2,8), then start moving towards (5,5) by going DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nAnother thing to consider: If I eat the apple at (5,5), I'll grow longer, which might make it harder to maneuver. But that's a good problem to have because it means I'm gaining points.\n\nSo, to summarize, the immediate next move is RIGHT to (2,8), and then proceed towards (5,5) while avoiding my own body.\n</think>\n\nThe next move should be to the RIGHT to position (2,8), allowing the snake to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) while avoiding its own body.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

So, moving RIGHT to (2,8) seems like the best option because it allows me to start moving towards an apple at (5,5) or (9,2) without hitting my body.\n\nOnce I move RIGHT to (2,8), my snake's body will be [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)]. From there, I can plan a path towards (5,5) by alternating between moving DOWN and RIGHT, ensuring I avoid my own body as I grow.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake at (8,5), but since it's far away, it's not an immediate threat. My focus is on reaching the nearest apple safely.\n\nSo, the next move is to go RIGHT to (2,8).\n</think>\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

My goal is to get to an apple to grow and gain points without dying. Let me think about what my options are.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is at the bottom left corner at (0,6). That means it's on the leftmost column, so moving left isn't possible because I'll go out of bounds and die. So my possible moves are up, right, or down. But wait, down from (0,6) would take me to (0,5), which is still in bounds. Right would take me to (1,6), and up would take me to (0,7). \n\nNow, let me check where the apples are. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), (1,3), and (5,5). But I'm at (0,6). So moving right to (1,6) would put me closer to the apple at (1,8) or (1,3). Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) would still have me on the left edge, which isn't helpful because the apples are either to the right or up higher but to the right as well.\n\nI should probably head towards the apple at (1,8) because it's the closest in terms of columns. But I'm two rows below that. Alternatively, the apple at (1,3) is even further down. Wait, maybe I should check the distances better.\n\nWait, (1,8) is two units up from my current position if I move right once. So moving right to (1,6) and then possibly up to (1,7) and then (1,8). That's a plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) and then right twice to (2,7), but that might not be as direct.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (7,5) with an empty body, but I don't know where it's going. It might not interfere with me right now since I'm on the opposite side of the board. So probably safe to go after the apple at (1,8).\n\nBut moving right to (1,6) is the first step. Let me think if there are any obstacles. The apples are at (1,8), so if I move right to (1,6), I can then move up to (1,7) and then up to (1,8) to eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's further away, so maybe not the best choice right now.\n\nWait, no, (5,5) is in the middle, but I'm at (0,6), so moving to (5,5) would require moving right five times and down once, which might take more steps, and maybe the enemy snake could interfere. Whereas (1,8) is just two steps up from (1,6).\n\nSo I think the best move is to move right to (1,6), then up to (1,7), then up to (1,8) to eat the apple. That seems manageable and the closest apple. So I should start by moving right.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (1,8), I'll move right to (1,6), bringing me closer to the target. This avoids walls and potential collisions, allowing me to proceed towards the apple efficiently.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

But reaching them requires me to cross the path followed by enemy Snake #2, which might not be a good idea.\n\nAnother alternative is the apple at (5, 5) which is 3 steps down and 3 steps to the left. Since Snake #2 is relatively further up, this approach seems likely to be safer for now and gives me more flexibility to navigate the board.\n\nMy strategy for the next move should be reaching the apple at (5, 5) without crossing the path of the enemy snake.

The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). Let me assess my situation and plan the next move.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (1,6), so looking at the board, that's in the second column (since x=1) and the seventh row from the bottom. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), which is two rows above me, and possibly (1,3), which is three rows below me. Alternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), which is further away both in columns and rows.\n\nI should prioritize the closest apple to minimize the number of moves and avoid potential threats. The apple at (1,8) is directly above me, two rows up. That seems like the most straightforward path without any obstacles. Moving up from (1,6) to (1,7) and then to (1,8) would allow me to eat the apple in two moves. \n\nI should also consider any potential threats. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). Since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it seems unlikely that snake #1 will interfere with my path to (1,8). There are no other snakes mentioned, so the main concern is avoiding walls and myself.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (5,5), but that would require moving right four times and then down once. This would take more moves and might put me at risk of collision with the enemy snake or walls. Therefore, it's not the optimal path.\n\nI should also be cautious about moving too far left or right, as that could lead me into walls. Since I'm at x=1, moving left would take me to x=0, which is the edge of the board. It's safer to stay in the right direction towards higher x values if needed, but in this case, moving up is the better choice.\n\nSo, the plan is to move up to (1,7) first. Once there, I can then move up again to (1,8) and eat the apple, growing my snake and gaining a point. This path is direct and avoids any immediate dangers.\n\nI should also think about my next move after eating the apple. Once I've eaten, I'll have to decide whether to go after another apple or avoid potential threats. But for now, focusing on reaching (1,8) is the priority.\n\nIn summary, moving up to (1,7) is the next logical step towards reaching the apple at (1,8). I should execute this move to get closer to my target without any obstacles in the way.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (1,8), I'll move up to (1,7), bringing me one step closer.

However, the apple at position (5, 5) is now even closer, which means fewer moves and less risk. \n\nContrasting last time, the snake is posing less of a threat and there is now nothing obstructing the path towards the apple at position (5, 5).

Now, I need to plan my next move to get closer to the apple at (1,8). \n\nLet me check the board state again. The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My position after moving UP from (1,6) to (1,7) puts me one step away from the apple at (1,8). That's great because I can eat it in the next move without any obstacles in the way.\n\nNow, I should consider if there's any immediate danger. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). That's pretty far from my current position, so I don't think I'll be in any danger from them right now. My main focus is to reach the apple at (1,8) without hitting any walls or my own body.\n\nI need to make sure that moving UP again won't cause me to hit a wall. Since the board goes from y=0 to y=9, my current y-coordinate is 7. Moving UP to y=8 is still within the board, so that's safe. The next move after that would be to y=9, but I should check if there's an apple there. Wait, the apple is at (1,8), so once I reach y=8, I'll eat the apple and grow, which is the goal.\n\nSo, the next logical move is to go UP again to (1,8) and eat the apple. There's no need to change direction or worry about anything else since the path is clear. I should just proceed with moving UP.\n\nI don't think I need to plan beyond that for now because my immediate goal is to eat the apple at (1,8). After that, I can reassess the board and decide the next steps, maybe going after another apple or avoiding the enemy snake if necessary.\n\nIn summary, moving UP to (1,8) is the correct next move.

Plus, moving UP also gives me further clearance to move towards either the apple at (9, 6) or (5, 5) depending on the enemy's move.\n\nTaking into account all the aforementioned analysis, my best bet would be to go UP. While initially, this route may take a move more, it's the safer and strategically more viable choice.\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let me think through my next move step by step. My snake is currently at (1,8), and I just ate an apple here, so I've grown longer. The apples available now are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My last move was UP, which got me to (1,8). \n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly below me. My snake's body is currently at positions [(1,8), (1,7)], assuming I moved up from (1,7). I need to decide whether to go down towards (1,3) or perhaps move sideways to reach another apple.\n\nGoing straight down to (1,3) seems the most straightforward path. Since my body is behind me, I don't have to worry about hitting myself if I go down. But I should check if the path is clear. Moving from (1,8) to (1,7) is my previous position, which is safe. Then to (1,6), (1,5), etc., down to (1,3). That seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right towards (5,5), but that's quite a distance and might not be efficient. Also, moving left from (1,8) isn't possible because x=1 is the leftmost column; moving left would take me to x=0, but that's still at (1,8) moving left, wait no\u2014coordinates are (x,y), so moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8). Is that a good idea? Well, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's not directly in the left direction. Maybe not the best move.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). That's far from my current position, so no immediate threat.\n\nSo, my best strategy is to head down towards (1,3). To do that, I need to change direction from UP to DOWN. Wait, no, because moving down from (1,8) would be decreasing the y-coordinate, which is correct. So, I would start moving DOWN each turn until I reach (1,3).\n\nBut I should also be cautious about my own body. If I move down to (1,7), which is where I was before, that's part of my body now. Wait, when I moved up to (1,8), my body would have followed. So, my snake's body is at (1,8) and (1,7). Moving down to (1,7) would mean I'm trying to go back into my own body, which would cause me to die. Oh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move down immediately because that would make me run into my own body. I need to change direction. Maybe I should move right to (2,8) and then proceed down from there. Let me think about this.\n\nIf I move RIGHT from (1,8) to (2,8), that's a new position, and my body would follow: [ (1,8), (1,7) ]. Then, from (2,8), I can start moving down towards (2,3), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving right to (5,8) but that's not an apple either. The apples are at (5,5), which is down and to the right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT to (0,8). Is that a wall? No, walls are at x=0 and y=0. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9), so x=0 is the leftmost, y=0 is the bottom. So moving left from (1,8) to (0,8) is possible, but there's no apple there. So that might not be helpful unless I'm trying to loop around, which seems inefficient.\n\nSo, my options after (1,8) are limited. I can't go down because I'd hit my own body. I can go left or right. Let me check if moving right to (2,8) is safe and if I can then plan a path towards an apple without hitting my body.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,8), my snake's body would be at (1,8), (1,7). Then, from (2,8), I could move DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), etc., heading towards (5,5). But that's a long way. Alternatively, after moving to (2,8), I could move LEFT back to (1,8), but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then down to (0,3), but again, no apple there. Maybe moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then DOWN towards (2,3), but that's not an apple either. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5). That's an apple, so maybe that's a path.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I might run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can wait for the enemy snake to move or for another apple to appear, but that's not strategic.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial assessment. When I moved UP to (1,8), my body followed, so now my snake is from (1,8) to (1,7). To move down, I need to go to (1,7), which is part of my body. So I can't move DOWN. Therefore, I must move either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,8), my body would extend to (1,8), (1,7), and then next move I can go DOWN from (2,8) to (2,7), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't seem beneficial.\n\nSo, the best move is to go RIGHT to (2,8) to avoid hitting my own body and then plan to move towards the apple at (5,5) or (9,2). But that's a bit of a detour. Alternatively, I could consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then DOWN towards (0,3), but that doesn't help me reach any apple sooner.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple at (9,2) is another option. If I move RIGHT from (2,8) towards (9,8), then down to (9,2), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then right to (3,8), etc., but again, not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just go LEFT to (0,8) and then see if I can loop around, but that might take too many moves. Alternatively, maybe I should just go RIGHT and then find a path towards an apple.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another apple at (2,0), which is to the left and down. But from (1,8), moving down is blocked by my body. So I can't go that way immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should stay put and change direction, but that doesn't make sense because I need to keep moving.\n\nWait, no, I have to move in a direction every turn. So, the only options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but DOWN is into my body, so I can't do that. So I have to choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nConsidering that, moving RIGHT to (2,8) seems the better option because it allows me to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) eventually. Moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't lead me towards any apple directly.\n\nSo, my next move should be RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, I can start moving down towards (5,5).\n\nWait, but from (2,8), moving down would take me to (2,7), (2,6), etc., which isn't directly towards (5,5). To get to (5,5), I need to move right and down. So, perhaps after moving to (2,8), I should then move RIGHT again to (3,8), then to (4,8), and so on, until I reach (5,8), and then move down to (5,5). But that's a lot of moves and I might run into my own body.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better strategy is to move RIGHT, then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., in a diagonal path towards (5,5). But I'm not sure if that's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just go to (5,8) and then down, but that's assuming I can get there without hitting my body.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (2,8). Now, my body is at (1,8) and (1,7).\n2. From (2,8), move DOWN to (2,7).\n3. Then move RIGHT to (3,7).\n4. Then DOWN to (3,6).\n5. Continue this pattern until I reach (5,5).\n\nBut that might take too many steps and I could potentially run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT all the way to (5,8) and then DOWN to (5,5). That would take fewer steps but might be riskier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move RIGHT once to get to (2,8), then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., towards (5,5). But I think that would work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nNext move: RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, start moving towards (5,5) by moving DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own body. After moving to (2,8), my body will be at (2,8), (1,8), (1,7). Then, moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe because (2,7) is not occupied yet. Then, moving RIGHT to (3,7) is also safe. Continue this way towards (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I reach (5,8) directly, I can then move DOWN to (5,5) without any issues, but that would require moving RIGHT four times first, from (2,8) to (6,8), which seems too far and possibly into enemy territory.\n\nWait, where is the enemy snake? Snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). So, if I go towards (5,5), I'm moving away from the enemy. That should be safe.\n\nSo, the best next move is to go RIGHT to (2,8), then start moving towards (5,5) by going DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nAnother thing to consider: If I eat the apple at (5,5), I'll grow longer, which might make it harder to maneuver. But that's a good problem to have because it means I'm gaining points.\n\nSo, to summarize, the immediate next move is RIGHT to (2,8), and then proceed towards (5,5) while avoiding my own body.\n</think>\n\nThe next move should be to the RIGHT to position (2,8), allowing the snake to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) while avoiding its own body.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The apples are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), (2,0). My snake is currently positioned at (4,8), and the enemy snakes are at (7,7) with body at (7,6), and enemy snake #1 is at (1,3), but wait, (1,3) is also an apple. Oh, wait, I think I misread that. The apples are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), (2,0), and (9,6). So enemy snake #1 is at (7,7) with body at (7,6), and enemy Snake #1's head is at (7,7), body at (7,6). \n\nWait, the board state shows T2 at (8,4), which might be a typo, but I think I should focus on the apples. My snake is at (4,8). The closest apple seems to be at (5,5), which is 1 unit right and 3 down. Moving towards that apple would be a good strategy. \n\nLooking at possible moves: I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (4,8), moving UP would take me to (4,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible because moving up from y=8 would take me to y=9, which is allowed since the grid goes up to (9,9). Wait, no, the grid is from (0,0) to (9,9), so (4,9) is within bounds. But moving up to (4,9) doesn't get me closer to any apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down would take me to (4,7), which is a step towards the apple at (5,5). But wait, moving down would decrease the y-coordinate by 1, so from (4,8) to (4,7). Then from there, I can move right to (5,7), then continue down towards (5,5). That seems feasible. \n\nMoving left would take me to (3,8), which is away from the apple at (5,5), so that's not helpful. Moving right would take me to (5,8), which is moving towards the apple at (5,5) but getting further in y-coordinate. Alternatively, I can move right to (5,8) and then down to (5,7), (5,6), etc., which would get me to (5,5). But is that a better path?\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at y=5, so from (4,8) moving right to (5,8) would require moving down 3 more steps, but that's possible. Alternatively, moving down to (4,7), then right to (5,7), then down to (5,6), and so on. Both paths are possible, but which is safer?\n\nI should also check where the enemy snakes are. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,7) with body at (7,6). That's not too close to my current position, but I should be cautious not to move towards that area. The other enemy snake is at (7,7), so I should avoid moving towards the right beyond (5,8) if possible.\n\nAnother option is to check if any apples are closer. The apple at (9,6) is quite far, and (1,3) is far to the left. (9,2) and (2,0) are also far. So the closest apple is at (5,5).\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go DOWN to (4,7), then from there move RIGHT towards (5,7), and continue down to (5,5). \n\nWait, but what about the enemy at (7,7)? If I move down to (4,7), I might be closer to the enemy, but I can avoid them by staying to the left. Alternatively, moving right first might give me a clearer path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,8) first, then down towards (5,7) to get to (5,5). That might be a safer path because I'm moving along the right side, which is away from the enemy at (7,7).\n\nWait, if I move right to (5,8), then I can go down to (5,7), (5,6), and so on. That seems like a clear path without immediate threats. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right doesn't cause me to hit my body. Since my snake is only at (4,8), moving right to (5,8) is safe. Then, in the next move, I can go down to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, I think moving RIGHT to (5,8) is the best move. Then, in the following moves, I can go down towards (5,5).\n</think>\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

My goal is to get to an apple to grow and gain points without dying. Let me think about what my options are.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is at the bottom left corner at (0,6). That means it's on the leftmost column, so moving left isn't possible because I'll go out of bounds and die. So my possible moves are up, right, or down. But wait, down from (0,6) would take me to (0,5), which is still in bounds. Right would take me to (1,6), and up would take me to (0,7). \n\nNow, let me check where the apples are. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), (1,3), and (5,5). But I'm at (0,6). So moving right to (1,6) would put me closer to the apple at (1,8) or (1,3). Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) would still have me on the left edge, which isn't helpful because the apples are either to the right or up higher but to the right as well.\n\nI should probably head towards the apple at (1,8) because it's the closest in terms of columns. But I'm two rows below that. Alternatively, the apple at (1,3) is even further down. Wait, maybe I should check the distances better.\n\nWait, (1,8) is two units up from my current position if I move right once. So moving right to (1,6) and then possibly up to (1,7) and then (1,8). That's a plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) and then right twice to (2,7), but that might not be as direct.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (7,5) with an empty body, but I don't know where it's going. It might not interfere with me right now since I'm on the opposite side of the board. So probably safe to go after the apple at (1,8).\n\nBut moving right to (1,6) is the first step. Let me think if there are any obstacles. The apples are at (1,8), so if I move right to (1,6), I can then move up to (1,7) and then up to (1,8) to eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's further away, so maybe not the best choice right now.\n\nWait, no, (5,5) is in the middle, but I'm at (0,6), so moving to (5,5) would require moving right five times and down once, which might take more steps, and maybe the enemy snake could interfere. Whereas (1,8) is just two steps up from (1,6).\n\nSo I think the best move is to move right to (1,6), then up to (1,7), then up to (1,8) to eat the apple. That seems manageable and the closest apple. So I should start by moving right.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (1,8), I'll move right to (1,6), bringing me closer to the target.

I'm at (1,6), so looking at the board, that's in the second column (since x=1) and the seventh row from the bottom. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), which is two rows above me, and possibly (1,3), which is three rows below me. Alternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), which is further away both in columns and rows.\n\nI should prioritize the closest apple to minimize the number of moves and avoid potential threats. The apple at (1,8) is directly above me, two rows up. That seems like the most straightforward path without any obstacles. Moving up from (1,6) to (1,7) and then to (1,8) would allow me to eat the apple in two moves. \n\nI should also consider any potential threats. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). Since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it seems unlikely that snake #1 will interfere with my path to (1,8). There are no other snakes mentioned, so the main concern is avoiding walls and myself.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (5,5), but that would require moving right four times and then down once. This would take more moves and might put me at risk of collision with the enemy snake or walls. Therefore, it's not the optimal path.\n\nI should also be cautious about moving too far left or right, as that could lead me into walls. Since I'm at x=1, moving left would take me to x=0, which is the edge of the board. It's safer to stay in the right direction towards higher x values if needed, but in this case, moving up is the better choice.\n\nSo, the plan is to move up to (1,7) first. Once there, I can then move up again to (1,8) and eat the apple, growing my snake and gaining a point. This path is direct and avoids any immediate dangers.\n\nI should also think about my next move after eating the apple.

But for now, focusing on reaching (1,8) is the priority.\n\nIn summary, moving up to (1,7) is the next logical step towards reaching the apple at (1,8). I should execute this move to get closer to my target without any obstacles in the way.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (1,8), I'll move up to (1,7), bringing me one step closer.

My position after moving UP from (1,6) to (1,7) puts me one step away from the apple at (1,8).

The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). That's pretty far from my current position, so I don't think I'll be in any danger from them right now. My main focus is to reach the apple at (1,8) without hitting any walls or my own body.\n\nI need to make sure that moving UP again won't cause me to hit a wall. Since the board goes from y=0 to y=9, my current y-coordinate is 7. Moving UP to y=8 is still within the board, so that's safe.

I should just proceed with moving UP.\n\nI don't think I need to plan beyond that for now because my immediate goal is to eat the apple at (1,8). After that, I can reassess the board and decide the next steps, maybe going after another apple or avoiding the enemy snake if necessary.\n\nIn summary, moving UP to (1,8) is the correct next move.

Plus, moving UP also gives me further clearance to move towards either the apple at (9, 6) or (5, 5) depending on the enemy's move.\n\nTaking into account all the aforementioned analysis, my best bet would be to go UP.

The apples available now are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My last move was UP, which got me to (1,8). \n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly below me. My snake's body is currently at positions [(1,8), (1,7)], assuming I moved up from (1,7). I need to decide whether to go down towards (1,3) or perhaps move sideways to reach another apple.\n\nGoing straight down to (1,3) seems the most straightforward path. Since my body is behind me, I don't have to worry about hitting myself if I go down. But I should check if the path is clear. Moving from (1,8) to (1,7) is my previous position, which is safe. Then to (1,6), (1,5), etc., down to (1,3). That seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right towards (5,5), but that's quite a distance and might not be efficient. Also, moving left from (1,8) isn't possible because x=1 is the leftmost column; moving left would take me to x=0, but that's still at (1,8) moving left, wait no\u2014coordinates are (x,y), so moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8).

That's far from my current position, so no immediate threat.\n\nSo, my best strategy is to head down towards (1,3). To do that, I need to change direction from UP to DOWN. Wait, no, because moving down from (1,8) would be decreasing the y-coordinate, which is correct. So, I would start moving DOWN each turn until I reach (1,3).\n\nBut I should also be cautious about my own body. If I move down to (1,7), which is where I was before, that's part of my body now. Wait, when I moved up to (1,8), my body would have followed. So, my snake's body is at (1,8) and (1,7). Moving down to (1,7) would mean I'm trying to go back into my own body, which would cause me to die. Oh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move down immediately because that would make me run into my own body. I need to change direction. Maybe I should move right to (2,8) and then proceed down from there. Let me think about this.\n\nIf I move RIGHT from (1,8) to (2,8), that's a new position, and my body would follow: [ (1,8), (1,7) ]. Then, from (2,8), I can start moving down towards (2,3), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving right to (5,8) but that's not an apple either. The apples are at (5,5), which is down and to the right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT to (0,8). Is that a wall? No, walls are at x=0 and y=0. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9), so x=0 is the leftmost, y=0 is the bottom. So moving left from (1,8) to (0,8) is possible, but there's no apple there. So that might not be helpful unless I'm trying to loop around, which seems inefficient.\n\nSo, my options after (1,8) are limited. I can't go down because I'd hit my own body. I can go left or right. Let me check if moving right to (2,8) is safe and if I can then plan a path towards an apple without hitting my body.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,8), my snake's body would be at (1,8), (1,7). Then, from (2,8), I could move DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), etc., heading towards (5,5). But that's a long way. Alternatively, after moving to (2,8), I could move LEFT back to (1,8), but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then down to (0,3), but again, no apple there. Maybe moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then DOWN towards (2,3), but that's not an apple either. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5). That's an apple, so maybe that's a path.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I might run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can wait for the enemy snake to move or for another apple to appear, but that's not strategic.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial assessment. When I moved UP to (1,8), my body followed, so now my snake is from (1,8) to (1,7). To move down, I need to go to (1,7), which is part of my body. So I can't move DOWN. Therefore, I must move either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,8), my body would extend to (1,8), (1,7), and then next move I can go DOWN from (2,8) to (2,7), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't seem beneficial.\n\nSo, the best move is to go RIGHT to (2,8) to avoid hitting my own body and then plan to move towards the apple at (5,5) or (9,2). But that's a bit of a detour. Alternatively, I could consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then DOWN towards (0,3), but that doesn't help me reach any apple sooner.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple at (9,2) is another option. If I move RIGHT from (2,8) towards (9,8), then down to (9,2), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then right to (3,8), etc., but again, not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just go LEFT to (0,8) and then see if I can loop around, but that might take too many moves. Alternatively, maybe I should just go RIGHT and then find a path towards an apple.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another apple at (2,0), which is to the left and down. But from (1,8), moving down is blocked by my body. So I can't go that way immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should stay put and change direction, but that doesn't make sense because I need to keep moving.\n\nWait, no, I have to move in a direction every turn. So, the only options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but DOWN is into my body, so I can't do that. So I have to choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nConsidering that, moving RIGHT to (2,8) seems the better option because it allows me to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) eventually. Moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't lead me towards any apple directly.\n\nSo, my next move should be RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, I can start moving down towards (5,5).\n\nWait, but from (2,8), moving down would take me to (2,7), (2,6), etc., which isn't directly towards (5,5). To get to (5,5), I need to move right and down. So, perhaps after moving to (2,8), I should then move RIGHT again to (3,8), then to (4,8), and so on, until I reach (5,8), and then move down to (5,5). But that's a lot of moves and I might run into my own body.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better strategy is to move RIGHT, then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., in a diagonal path towards (5,5). But I'm not sure if that's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just go to (5,8) and then down, but that's assuming I can get there without hitting my body.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (2,8). Now, my body is at (1,8) and (1,7).\n2. From (2,8), move DOWN to (2,7).\n3. Then move RIGHT to (3,7).\n4. Then DOWN to (3,6).\n5. Continue this pattern until I reach (5,5).\n\nBut that might take too many steps and I could potentially run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT all the way to (5,8) and then DOWN to (5,5). That would take fewer steps but might be riskier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move RIGHT once to get to (2,8), then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., towards (5,5). But I think that would work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nNext move: RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, start moving towards (5,5) by moving DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own body. After moving to (2,8), my body will be at (2,8), (1,8), (1,7). Then, moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe because (2,7) is not occupied yet. Then, moving RIGHT to (3,7) is also safe. Continue this way towards (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I reach (5,8) directly, I can then move DOWN to (5,5) without any issues, but that would require moving RIGHT four times first, from (2,8) to (6,8), which seems too far and possibly into enemy territory.\n\nWait, where is the enemy snake? Snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). So, if I go towards (5,5), I'm moving away from the enemy. That should be safe.\n\nSo, the best next move is to go RIGHT to (2,8), then start moving towards (5,5) by going DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nAnother thing to consider: If I eat the apple at (5,5), I'll grow longer, which might make it harder to maneuver. But that's a good problem to have because it means I'm gaining points.\n\nSo, to summarize, the immediate next move is RIGHT to (2,8), and then proceed towards (5,5) while avoiding my own body.\n</think>\n\nThe next move should be to the RIGHT to position (2,8), allowing the snake to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) while avoiding its own body.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The apples are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), (2,0). My snake is currently positioned at (4,8), and the enemy snakes are at (7,7) with body at (7,6), and enemy snake #1 is at (1,3), but wait, (1,3) is also an apple. Oh, wait, I think I misread that. The apples are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), (2,0), and (9,6). So enemy snake #1 is at (7,7) with body at (7,6), and enemy Snake #1's head is at (7,7), body at (7,6). \n\nWait, the board state shows T2 at (8,4), which might be a typo, but I think I should focus on the apples. My snake is at (4,8). The closest apple seems to be at (5,5), which is 1 unit right and 3 down. Moving towards that apple would be a good strategy. \n\nLooking at possible moves: I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (4,8), moving UP would take me to (4,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible because moving up from y=8 would take me to y=9, which is allowed since the grid goes up to (9,9). Wait, no, the grid is from (0,0) to (9,9), so (4,9) is within bounds. But moving up to (4,9) doesn't get me closer to any apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down would take me to (4,7), which is a step towards the apple at (5,5). But wait, moving down would decrease the y-coordinate by 1, so from (4,8) to (4,7). Then from there, I can move right to (5,7), then continue down towards (5,5). That seems feasible. \n\nMoving left would take me to (3,8), which is away from the apple at (5,5), so that's not helpful. Moving right would take me to (5,8), which is moving towards the apple at (5,5) but getting further in y-coordinate. Alternatively, I can move right to (5,8) and then down to (5,7), (5,6), etc., which would get me to (5,5). But is that a better path?\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at y=5, so from (4,8) moving right to (5,8) would require moving down 3 more steps, but that's possible. Alternatively, moving down to (4,7), then right to (5,7), then down to (5,6), and so on. Both paths are possible, but which is safer?\n\nI should also check where the enemy snakes are. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,7) with body at (7,6). That's not too close to my current position, but I should be cautious not to move towards that area. The other enemy snake is at (7,7), so I should avoid moving towards the right beyond (5,8) if possible.\n\nAnother option is to check if any apples are closer. The apple at (9,6) is quite far, and (1,3) is far to the left. (9,2) and (2,0) are also far. So the closest apple is at (5,5).\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go DOWN to (4,7), then from there move RIGHT towards (5,7), and continue down to (5,5). \n\nWait, but what about the enemy at (7,7)? If I move down to (4,7), I might be closer to the enemy, but I can avoid them by staying to the left. Alternatively, moving right first might give me a clearer path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,8) first, then down towards (5,7) to get to (5,5). That might be a safer path because I'm moving along the right side, which is away from the enemy at (7,7).\n\nWait, if I move right to (5,8), then I can go down to (5,7), (5,6), and so on. That seems like a clear path without immediate threats. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right doesn't cause me to hit my body. Since my snake is only at (4,8), moving right to (5,8) is safe. Then, in the next move, I can go down to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, I think moving RIGHT to (5,8) is the best move.

My goal is to get to an apple to grow and gain points without dying. Let me think about what my options are.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is at the bottom left corner at (0,6). That means it's on the leftmost column, so moving left isn't possible because I'll go out of bounds and die. So my possible moves are up, right, or down. But wait, down from (0,6) would take me to (0,5), which is still in bounds. Right would take me to (1,6), and up would take me to (0,7). \n\nNow, let me check where the apples are. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), (1,3), and (5,5). But I'm at (0,6). So moving right to (1,6) would put me closer to the apple at (1,8) or (1,3). Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) would still have me on the left edge, which isn't helpful because the apples are either to the right or up higher but to the right as well.\n\nI should probably head towards the apple at (1,8) because it's the closest in terms of columns.

Wait, maybe I should check the distances better.\n\nWait, (1,8) is two units up from my current position if I move right once. So moving right to (1,6) and then possibly up to (1,7) and then (1,8). That's a plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,7) and then right twice to (2,7), but that might not be as direct.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake, snake #1, is at (7,5) with an empty body, but I don't know where it's going. It might not interfere with me right now since I'm on the opposite side of the board. So probably safe to go after the apple at (1,8).\n\nBut moving right to (1,6) is the first step.

Whereas (1,8) is just two steps up from (1,6).\n\nSo I think the best move is to move right to (1,6), then up to (1,7), then up to (1,8) to eat the apple. That seems manageable and the closest apple. So I should start by moving right.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (1,8), I'll move right to (1,6), bringing me closer to the target.

The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). Let me assess my situation and plan the next move.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (1,6), so looking at the board, that's in the second column (since x=1) and the seventh row from the bottom. The closest apples seem to be at (1,8), which is two rows above me, and possibly (1,3), which is three rows below me. Alternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), which is further away both in columns and rows.\n\nI should prioritize the closest apple to minimize the number of moves and avoid potential threats. The apple at (1,8) is directly above me, two rows up. That seems like the most straightforward path without any obstacles. Moving up from (1,6) to (1,7) and then to (1,8) would allow me to eat the apple in two moves. \n\nI should also consider any potential threats. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). Since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it seems unlikely that snake #1 will interfere with my path to (1,8). There are no other snakes mentioned, so the main concern is avoiding walls and myself.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (5,5), but that would require moving right four times and then down once. This would take more moves and might put me at risk of collision with the enemy snake or walls. Therefore, it's not the optimal path.\n\nI should also be cautious about moving too far left or right, as that could lead me into walls. Since I'm at x=1, moving left would take me to x=0, which is the edge of the board. It's safer to stay in the right direction towards higher x values if needed, but in this case, moving up is the better choice.\n\nSo, the plan is to move up to (1,7) first. Once there, I can then move up again to (1,8) and eat the apple, growing my snake and gaining a point. This path is direct and avoids any immediate dangers.\n\nI should also think about my next move after eating the apple. Once I've eaten, I'll have to decide whether to go after another apple or avoid potential threats. But for now, focusing on reaching (1,8) is the priority.\n\nIn summary, moving up to (1,7) is the next logical step towards reaching the apple at (1,8). I should execute this move to get closer to my target without any obstacles in the way.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (1,8), I'll move up to (1,7), bringing me one step closer.

However, the apple at position (5, 5) is now even closer, which means fewer moves and less risk. \n\nContrasting last time, the snake is posing less of a threat and there is now nothing obstructing the path towards the apple at position (5, 5). Nevertheless, I should be cautious of the position of the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Now, I need to plan my next move to get closer to the apple at (1,8). \n\nLet me check the board state again. The apples are at (1,8), (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My position after moving UP from (1,6) to (1,7) puts me one step away from the apple at (1,8). That's great because I can eat it in the next move without any obstacles in the way.\n\nNow, I should consider if there's any immediate danger. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (8,5) with a body part at (7,5). That's pretty far from my current position, so I don't think I'll be in any danger from them right now. My main focus is to reach the apple at (1,8) without hitting any walls or my own body.\n\nI need to make sure that moving UP again won't cause me to hit a wall. Since the board goes from y=0 to y=9, my current y-coordinate is 7. Moving UP to y=8 is still within the board, so that's safe. The next move after that would be to y=9, but I should check if there's an apple there. Wait, the apple is at (1,8), so once I reach y=8, I'll eat the apple and grow, which is the goal.\n\nSo, the next logical move is to go UP again to (1,8) and eat the apple. There's no need to change direction or worry about anything else since the path is clear. I should just proceed with moving UP.\n\nI don't think I need to plan beyond that for now because my immediate goal is to eat the apple at (1,8). After that, I can reassess the board and decide the next steps, maybe going after another apple or avoiding the enemy snake if necessary.\n\nIn summary, moving UP to (1,8) is the correct next move. It's straightforward, safe, and allows me to gain a point by eating the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

Plus, moving UP also gives me further clearance to move towards either the apple at (9, 6) or (5, 5) depending on the enemy's move.\n\nTaking into account all the aforementioned analysis, my best bet would be to go UP. While initially, this route may take a move more, it's the safer and strategically more viable choice.\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let me think through my next move step by step. My snake is currently at (1,8), and I just ate an apple here, so I've grown longer. The apples available now are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), and (2,0). My last move was UP, which got me to (1,8). \n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly below me. My snake's body is currently at positions [(1,8), (1,7)], assuming I moved up from (1,7). I need to decide whether to go down towards (1,3) or perhaps move sideways to reach another apple.\n\nGoing straight down to (1,3) seems the most straightforward path. Since my body is behind me, I don't have to worry about hitting myself if I go down. But I should check if the path is clear. Moving from (1,8) to (1,7) is my previous position, which is safe. Then to (1,6), (1,5), etc., down to (1,3). That seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could move right towards (5,5), but that's quite a distance and might not be efficient. Also, moving left from (1,8) isn't possible because x=1 is the leftmost column; moving left would take me to x=0, but that's still at (1,8) moving left, wait no\u2014coordinates are (x,y), so moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8). Is that a good idea? Well, there's an apple at (5,5), but that's not directly in the left direction. Maybe not the best move.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). That's far from my current position, so no immediate threat.\n\nSo, my best strategy is to head down towards (1,3). To do that, I need to change direction from UP to DOWN. Wait, no, because moving down from (1,8) would be decreasing the y-coordinate, which is correct. So, I would start moving DOWN each turn until I reach (1,3).\n\nBut I should also be cautious about my own body. If I move down to (1,7), which is where I was before, that's part of my body now. Wait, when I moved up to (1,8), my body would have followed. So, my snake's body is at (1,8) and (1,7). Moving down to (1,7) would mean I'm trying to go back into my own body, which would cause me to die. Oh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move down immediately because that would make me run into my own body. I need to change direction. Maybe I should move right to (2,8) and then proceed down from there. Let me think about this.\n\nIf I move RIGHT from (1,8) to (2,8), that's a new position, and my body would follow: [ (1,8), (1,7) ]. Then, from (2,8), I can start moving down towards (2,3), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving right to (5,8) but that's not an apple either. The apples are at (5,5), which is down and to the right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT to (0,8). Is that a wall? No, walls are at x=0 and y=0. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9), so x=0 is the leftmost, y=0 is the bottom. So moving left from (1,8) to (0,8) is possible, but there's no apple there. So that might not be helpful unless I'm trying to loop around, which seems inefficient.\n\nSo, my options after (1,8) are limited. I can't go down because I'd hit my own body. I can go left or right. Let me check if moving right to (2,8) is safe and if I can then plan a path towards an apple without hitting my body.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,8), my snake's body would be at (1,8), (1,7). Then, from (2,8), I could move DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), etc., heading towards (5,5). But that's a long way. Alternatively, after moving to (2,8), I could move LEFT back to (1,8), but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then down to (0,3), but again, no apple there. Maybe moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then DOWN towards (2,3), but that's not an apple either. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5). That's an apple, so maybe that's a path.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I might run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can wait for the enemy snake to move or for another apple to appear, but that's not strategic.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial assessment. When I moved UP to (1,8), my body followed, so now my snake is from (1,8) to (1,7). To move down, I need to go to (1,7), which is part of my body. So I can't move DOWN. Therefore, I must move either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,8), my body would extend to (1,8), (1,7), and then next move I can go DOWN from (2,8) to (2,7), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't seem beneficial.\n\nSo, the best move is to go RIGHT to (2,8) to avoid hitting my own body and then plan to move towards the apple at (5,5) or (9,2). But that's a bit of a detour. Alternatively, I could consider moving LEFT to (0,8) and then DOWN towards (0,3), but that doesn't help me reach any apple sooner.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple at (9,2) is another option. If I move RIGHT from (2,8) towards (9,8), then down to (9,2), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (5,8) and then down to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (2,8) and then right to (3,8), etc., but again, not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just go LEFT to (0,8) and then see if I can loop around, but that might take too many moves. Alternatively, maybe I should just go RIGHT and then find a path towards an apple.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another apple at (2,0), which is to the left and down. But from (1,8), moving down is blocked by my body. So I can't go that way immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should stay put and change direction, but that doesn't make sense because I need to keep moving.\n\nWait, no, I have to move in a direction every turn. So, the only options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but DOWN is into my body, so I can't do that. So I have to choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nConsidering that, moving RIGHT to (2,8) seems the better option because it allows me to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) eventually. Moving LEFT to (0,8) doesn't lead me towards any apple directly.\n\nSo, my next move should be RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, I can start moving down towards (5,5).\n\nWait, but from (2,8), moving down would take me to (2,7), (2,6), etc., which isn't directly towards (5,5). To get to (5,5), I need to move right and down. So, perhaps after moving to (2,8), I should then move RIGHT again to (3,8), then to (4,8), and so on, until I reach (5,8), and then move down to (5,5). But that's a lot of moves and I might run into my own body.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better strategy is to move RIGHT, then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., in a diagonal path towards (5,5). But I'm not sure if that's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just go to (5,8) and then down, but that's assuming I can get there without hitting my body.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (2,8). Now, my body is at (1,8) and (1,7).\n2. From (2,8), move DOWN to (2,7).\n3. Then move RIGHT to (3,7).\n4. Then DOWN to (3,6).\n5. Continue this pattern until I reach (5,5).\n\nBut that might take too many steps and I could potentially run into my own body if I'm not careful. Alternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT all the way to (5,8) and then DOWN to (5,5). That would take fewer steps but might be riskier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move RIGHT once to get to (2,8), then DOWN, then RIGHT, etc., towards (5,5). But I think that would work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nNext move: RIGHT to (2,8). Then, from there, start moving towards (5,5) by moving DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own body. After moving to (2,8), my body will be at (2,8), (1,8), (1,7). Then, moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe because (2,7) is not occupied yet. Then, moving RIGHT to (3,7) is also safe. Continue this way towards (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I reach (5,8) directly, I can then move DOWN to (5,5) without any issues, but that would require moving RIGHT four times first, from (2,8) to (6,8), which seems too far and possibly into enemy territory.\n\nWait, where is the enemy snake? Snake #1 is at (8,5) with a body at (7,5). So, if I go towards (5,5), I'm moving away from the enemy. That should be safe.\n\nSo, the best next move is to go RIGHT to (2,8), then start moving towards (5,5) by going DOWN and RIGHT alternately.\n\nAnother thing to consider: If I eat the apple at (5,5), I'll grow longer, which might make it harder to maneuver. But that's a good problem to have because it means I'm gaining points.\n\nSo, to summarize, the immediate next move is RIGHT to (2,8), and then proceed towards (5,5) while avoiding my own body.\n</think>\n\nThe next move should be to the RIGHT to position (2,8), allowing the snake to start moving towards the apple at (5,5) while avoiding its own body.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The apples are at (5,5), (1,3), (9,2), (2,0). My snake is currently positioned at (4,8), and the enemy snakes are at (7,7) with body at (7,6), and enemy snake #1 is at (1,3), but wait, (1,3) is also an apple. Oh, wait, I think I misread that.

So enemy snake #1 is at (7,7) with body at (7,6), and enemy Snake #1's head is at (7,7), body at (7,6). \n\nWait, the board state shows T2 at (8,4), which might be a typo, but I think I should focus on the apples. My snake is at (4,8). The closest apple seems to be at (5,5), which is 1 unit right and 3 down. Moving towards that apple would be a good strategy. \n\nLooking at possible moves: I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (4,8), moving UP would take me to (4,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible because moving up from y=8 would take me to y=9, which is allowed since the grid goes up to (9,9). Wait, no, the grid is from (0,0) to (9,9), so (4,9) is within bounds. But moving up to (4,9) doesn't get me closer to any apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down would take me to (4,7), which is a step towards the apple at (5,5). But wait, moving down would decrease the y-coordinate by 1, so from (4,8) to (4,7). Then from there, I can move right to (5,7), then continue down towards (5,5). That seems feasible. \n\nMoving left would take me to (3,8), which is away from the apple at (5,5), so that's not helpful. Moving right would take me to (5,8), which is moving towards the apple at (5,5) but getting further in y-coordinate. Alternatively, I can move right to (5,8) and then down to (5,7), (5,6), etc., which would get me to (5,5). But is that a better path?\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at y=5, so from (4,8) moving right to (5,8) would require moving down 3 more steps, but that's possible. Alternatively, moving down to (4,7), then right to (5,7), then down to (5,6), and so on. Both paths are possible, but which is safer?\n\nI should also check where the enemy snakes are. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,7) with body at (7,6). That's not too close to my current position, but I should be cautious not to move towards that area. The other enemy snake is at (7,7), so I should avoid moving towards the right beyond (5,8) if possible.\n\nAnother option is to check if any apples are closer. The apple at (9,6) is quite far, and (1,3) is far to the left. (9,2) and (2,0) are also far. So the closest apple is at (5,5).\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go DOWN to (4,7), then from there move RIGHT towards (5,7), and continue down to (5,5). \n\nWait, but what about the enemy at (7,7)? If I move down to (4,7), I might be closer to the enemy, but I can avoid them by staying to the left. Alternatively, moving right first might give me a clearer path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,8) first, then down towards (5,7) to get to (5,5). That might be a safer path because I'm moving along the right side, which is away from the enemy at (7,7).\n\nWait, if I move right to (5,8), then I can go down to (5,7), (5,6), and so on. That seems like a clear path without immediate threats. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right doesn't cause me to hit my body. Since my snake is only at (4,8), moving right to (5,8) is safe. Then, in the next move, I can go down to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, I think moving RIGHT to (5,8) is the best move. Then, in the following moves, I can go down towards (5,5).\n</think>\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

However, note that the enemy snake #2 seems to heading either towards the apple at (5, 5), or it could change its course towards (9, 6) as well. It's a tricky decision.\n\nGiven that we are at a reasonable distance from each other and since snake #2 is closer to the apple at (5, 5) than (9, 6), it\u2019s likely it will continue moving towards the closer apple (5, 5). This means, it would start moving left from its current position (5, 8) and may not choose to go right towards the apple at (9, 6), as that would be a longer route.\n\nMy best strategy now is to continue moving UP to increase the distance between me and snake #2 and to stay on the direct path to the apple at (9, 6). While moving, I also need to monitor the direction of snake #2 closely to ensure it doesn\u2019t unexpectedly decide to head towards the (9, 6) apple. If snake #2 starts moving to the right unexpectedly, my plan to move RIGHT towards the apple at (9, 6) may need to be adjusted. Always keep that in mind. \n\nNext move: UP."

My immediate goal is to reach the closest apple to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (5,5), which is just three units down from my current position. To get there, I can move down from (5,8) to (5,7), then to (5,6), and finally to (5,5).

That's a few units to the right and down from my current position, so moving towards the apple at (5,5) shouldn't interfere with them. Another enemy snake is at (1,3), but that's far to the left, so I don't need to worry about it right now.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats along the path to (5,5), so moving down to reach the apple is my best move. Once I eat the apple, I'll gain a point and grow, which will give me an advantage in the game.\n\nI should make sure not to hit myself or the walls.
