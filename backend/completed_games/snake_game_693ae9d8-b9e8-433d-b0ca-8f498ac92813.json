This could influence our decision to avoid competition.\n* **Alignment with Previous Strategies**:\n\t- Given the assumed successful consumption of the apple at (7, 7), our next move should balance growth with safety, potentially leading us back towards a \"Wall Hug\" strategy after securing the next apple, if feasible.\n\n**Mid-Term Strategy Adjustment**:\n- After consuming the next targeted apple (if we successfully moved to (7, 7) and this move is towards another apple), reassess the board for potential threats and opportunities.
