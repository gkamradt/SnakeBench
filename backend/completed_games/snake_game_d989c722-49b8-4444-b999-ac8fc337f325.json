            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (7,0). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (4,5) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (0,2), (9,7), (6,7), (8,8), and (2,1).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are placed. The one at (0,2) is near the bottom left, (9,7) is near the top right, (6,7) is a bit to the left of that, (8,8) is almost top right, and (2,1) is somewhere in the lower middle.\n\nMy snake is at (7,0), which is on the bottom row, near the right side. The enemy snake is at (4,5), which is somewhere in the middle. Since the enemy's body is empty, it's just the head there, so I don't have to worry about its body blocking me unless it moves into that space.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. The closest apple to me is at (2,1), which is a few steps away. But maybe I should look for a more strategic position. The apple at (8,8) is quite far, but it's in the top right, which might be a good spot to grow. Alternatively, (9,7) is also in the top right but a bit closer.\n\nWait, but I'm at (7,0). If I move up, I can go towards the middle. Let me think about possible paths. If I move up from (7,0), I can go to (7,1), then (7,2), and so on. But I need to avoid the enemy snake and any walls.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (4,5). So if I move towards the top right, I might have to pass near (4,5), but since the enemy's body is empty, maybe it's safe. Alternatively, I could go for the apple at (2,1), which is closer. Let me calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (7,0) to (2,1): that's 5 steps left and 1 step up, so 6 moves. From (7,0) to (8,8): that's 1 step right and 8 steps up, which is 9 moves. So the apple at (2,1) is closer. But maybe the other apples are more valuable in the long run.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is also in the top middle. Let me see: from (7,0) to (6,7) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. So that's closer than (8,8). Hmm.\n\nI think I should prioritize the closest apple first to minimize the time spent moving. So (2,1) is the closest. But I need to make sure that moving towards it doesn't put me in danger of hitting the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me visualize the path. From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), then (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), then up to (2,1). That seems straightforward. But wait, the enemy is at (4,5), which is above (4,0). So if I go through (4,0), I'm passing below the enemy's position. Since the enemy's body is empty, I think that's okay. But I should check if the enemy might block me if it moves towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. From (7,0), move up to (7,1), then left to (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). That's 7 moves. But that's longer than the direct left path. So maybe the direct left path is better.\n\nWait, but moving left from (7,0) to (6,0) is possible. Let me check if any of those squares are blocked. The board state shows that at row 0, column 7 is my position, and row 1 has an apple at (2,1). So the squares from (7,0) to (2,0) are all empty except for the apple at (2,1). So moving left along the bottom row is safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,0), then (5,0), etc., seems safe. But I need to make sure that when I move, I don't run into myself. Since my snake's body is only at (7,0) right now, moving left won't cause me to hit myself unless I turn around, which I shouldn't do.\n\nWait, but my snake's body is just the head at (7,0), so moving left is fine. So the next move could be LEFT to (6,0). But wait, the apple is at (2,1), so I need to go up after reaching (2,0). Alternatively, maybe I can go up first to (7,1), but that's further away from the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple. Let me think about the other apples. The one at (8,8) is in the top right, which is a good spot, but it's far. The one at (6,7) is also in the top middle, which is closer than (8,8). Let me see the distance.\n\nFrom (7,0) to (6,7): moving left to (6,0), then up 7 times. That's 8 moves. Alternatively, moving up to (7,1), then left to (6,1), and so on. Either way, it's 8 moves. So maybe it's worth going for (6,7) because it's in a strategic position, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is even further. So maybe (6,7) is better. But I'm not sure if it's worth the longer path.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,1) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first. Let me think about the path again. From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), then up to (2,1). That's 6 moves. So I can reach it in 6 moves, which is better than the 8 moves for (6,7).\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (4,5). If I move towards (2,1), I'll pass through (4,0), which is directly below the enemy. But since the enemy's body is empty, I think that's okay. Unless the enemy moves towards me, but since it's just the head, I don't think it's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should avoid the area around (4,5) in case the enemy moves there. But since the enemy's body is empty, it's just the head, so unless it's moving towards me, I should be fine.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (2,1), I'll be moving along the bottom row, which is row 0. The enemy is at (4,5), which is in row 5, so it's not blocking my path. So moving left along row 0 is safe.\n\nSo, my options are to move LEFT to (6,0) or maybe move UP to (7,1). But moving LEFT seems more direct towards the apple at (2,1). However, I should also consider if moving UP might lead to a better position in the long run.\n\nWait, but moving UP from (7,0) would take me to (7,1), which is in row 1. From there, I can move towards the apple at (2,1) as well, but it's a longer path. So moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the apple at (8,8). Let me see: from (7,0), moving right to (8,0), then up 8 times to (8,8). That's 9 moves. But that's a long way, and I might be exposed to the enemy along the way.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (4,5), so if I move towards (8,8), I'll be moving along the right side, which is less likely to interfere with the enemy. But I'm not sure if that's the best move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (6,7). From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), then up 7 times. That's 8 moves. But again, I'm not sure if that's better than going for the closer apple at (2,1).\n\nI think the key is to maximize points while minimizing risk. Since the apple at (2,1) is the closest, I can reach it quickly and safely. So moving LEFT to (6,0) seems like the best first step.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (6,0), then next move LEFT to (5,0), and so on until I reach (2,0), then UP to (2,1). That seems safe. The enemy is at (4,5), so it's not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move UP first to (7,1), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving LEFT is better.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the enemy might block me in the future. Since the enemy is at (4,5), if I move towards (2,1), I'll be passing through (4,0), which is directly below the enemy. But since the enemy's body is empty, it's just the head, so unless it moves down, I should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move towards (6,7) because it's in a more central position, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,1) is only 6 moves away, so I can get it quickly. The other apples are further away, so it's better to get the closest one first.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to move LEFT to (6,0). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (2,1) without any immediate risks.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is LEFT to (6,0) to start moving towards the closest apple at (2,1).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (7,0).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (2,1) is the closest, requiring 6 moves to reach.\n3. **Path Safety:** Moving left along the bottom row (from (7,0) to (2,0)) is safe as there are no obstacles or enemies blocking this path.\n4. **Avoiding Risks:** The enemy snake is at (4,5), which is not on the path to (2,1), so no risk of collision.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to maximize points quickly and safely.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

This move would put us in a relatively safe position and allow us to grow our snake.\n\nFor now, let's focus on moving towards the apple at (0, 2). We'll reassess the situation after our next move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on Snake #1's movement and be prepared to change direction if necessary.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (7,0). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (4,5) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (0,2), (9,7), (6,7), (8,8), and (2,1).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are placed. The one at (0,2) is near the bottom left, (9,7) is near the top right, (6,7) is a bit to the left of that, (8,8) is almost top right, and (2,1) is somewhere in the lower middle.\n\nMy snake is at (7,0), which is on the bottom row, near the right side. The enemy snake is at (4,5), which is somewhere in the middle. Since the enemy's body is empty, it's just the head there, so I don't have to worry about its body blocking me unless it moves into that space.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. The closest apple to me is at (2,1), which is a few steps away. But maybe I should look for a more strategic position. The apple at (8,8) is quite far, but it's in the top right, which might be a good spot to grow. Alternatively, (9,7) is also in the top right but a bit closer.\n\nWait, but I'm at (7,0). If I move up, I can go to (7,1), then (7,2), and so on. But I need to avoid the enemy snake and any walls.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (4,5). So if I move towards the top right, I might have to pass near (4,5), but since the enemy's body is empty, maybe it's safe. Alternatively, I could go for the apple at (2,1), which is closer. Let me calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (7,0) to (2,1): that's 5 steps left and 1 step up, so 6 moves. From (7,0) to (8,8): that's 1 step right and 8 steps up, which is 9 moves. So the apple at (2,1) is closer. But maybe the other apples are more valuable in the long run.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is also in the top middle. Let me see: from (7,0) to (6,7) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. So that's closer than (8,8). Hmm.\n\nI think I should prioritize the closest apple first to minimize the time spent moving. So (2,1) is the closest. But I need to make sure that moving towards it doesn't put me in danger of hitting the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me visualize the path. From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), then (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), then up to (2,1). That seems straightforward. But wait, the enemy is at (4,5), which is above (4,0). So if I go through (4,0), I'm passing below the enemy's position. Since the enemy's body is empty, I think that's okay. But I should check if the enemy might block me if it moves towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. From (7,0), move up to (7,1), then left to (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). That's 7 moves. But that's longer than the direct left path. So maybe the direct left path is better.\n\nWait, but moving left from (7,0) to (6,0) is possible. Let me check if any of those squares are blocked. The board state shows that at row 0, column 7 is my position, and row 1 has an apple at (2,1). So the squares from (7,0) to (2,0) are all empty except for the apple at (2,1). So moving left along the bottom row is safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,0), then (5,0), etc., seems safe. But I need to make sure that when I move, I don't run into myself. Since my snake's body is only at (7,0) right now, moving left won't cause me to hit myself unless I turn around, which I shouldn't do.\n\nWait, but my snake's body is just the head at (7,0), so moving left is fine. So the next move could be LEFT to (6,0). But wait, the apple is at (2,1), so I need to go up after reaching (2,0). Alternatively, maybe I can go up first to (7,1), but that's further away from the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple. Let me think about the other apples. The one at (8,8) is in the top right, which is a good spot, but it's far. The one at (6,7) is also in the top middle, which is closer than (8,8). Let me see the distance.\n\nFrom (7,0) to (6,7): moving left to (6,0), then up 7 times. That's 8 moves. Alternatively, moving up to (7,1), then left to (6,1), and so on. Either way, it's 8 moves. So maybe it's worth going for (6,7) because it's in a strategic position, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is even further. So maybe (6,7) is better. But I'm not sure if it's worth the longer path.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,1) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first. Let me think about the path again. From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), then up to (2,1). That's 6 moves. So I can reach it in 6 moves, which is better than the 8 moves for (6,7).\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (4,5). If I move towards (2,1), I'll pass through (4,0), which is directly below the enemy. But since the enemy's body is empty, I think that's okay. Unless the enemy moves towards me, but since it's just the head, I don't think it's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should avoid the area around (4,5) in case the enemy moves there. But since the enemy's body is empty, it's just the head, so unless it's moving down, I should be fine.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (2,1), I'll be moving along the bottom row, which is row 0. The enemy is at (4,5), which is in row 5, so it's not blocking my path. So moving left along row 0 is safe.\n\nSo, my options are to move LEFT to (6,0) or maybe move UP to (7,1). But moving LEFT seems more direct towards the apple at (2,1). However, I should also consider if moving UP might lead to a better position in the long run.\n\nWait, but moving UP from (7,0) would take me to (7,1), which is in row 1. From there, I can move towards the apple at (2,1) as well, but it's a longer path. So moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the apple at (8,8). Let me see: from (7,0), moving right to (8,0), then up 8 times to (8,8). That's 9 moves. But that's a long way, and I might be exposed to the enemy along the way.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (4,5), so if I move towards (8,8), I'll be moving along the right side, which is less likely to interfere with the enemy. But I'm not sure if that's the best move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (6,7). From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), then up 7 times. That's 8 moves. But again, I'm not sure if that's better than going for the closer apple at (2,1).\n\nI think the key is to maximize points while minimizing risk. Since the apple at (2,1) is the closest, I can reach it quickly and safely. So moving LEFT to (6,0) seems like the best first step.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (6,0), then next move LEFT to (5,0), and so on until I reach (2,0), then UP to (2,1). That seems safe. The enemy is at (4,5), so it's not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move UP first to (7,1), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving LEFT is better.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the enemy might block me in the future. Since the enemy is at (4,5), if I move towards (2,1), I'll be passing through (4,0), which is directly below the enemy. But since the enemy's body is empty, it's just the head, so unless it moves down, I should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move towards (6,7) because it's in a more central position, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,1) is only 6 moves away, so I can get it quickly. The other apples are further away, so it's better to get the closest one first.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to move LEFT to (6,0). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (2,1) without any immediate risks.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (7,0).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (2,1) is the closest, requiring 6 moves to reach.\n3. **Path Safety:** Moving left along the bottom row (from (7,0) to (2,0)) is safe as there are no obstacles or enemies blocking this path.\n4. **Avoiding Risks:** The enemy snake is at (4,5), which is not on the path to (2,1), so no risk of collision.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to maximize points quickly and safely.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is LEFT to (6,0) to start moving towards the closest apple at (2,1).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (7,0).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (2,1) is the closest, requiring 6 moves to reach.\n3. **Path Safety:** Moving left along the bottom row (from (7,0) to (2,0)) is safe as there are no obstacles or enemies blocking this path.\n4. **Avoiding Risks:** The enemy snake is at (4,5), which is not on the path to (2,1), so no risk of collision.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to maximize points quickly and safely.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</response>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

The apple at (8,8) is quite far, but it's in the top right, which might be a good spot to grow. Alternatively, (9,7) is also in the top right but a bit closer.\n\nWait, but I'm at (7,0). If I move up, I can go to (7,1), then (7,2), and so on. But I need to avoid the enemy snake and any walls.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (4,5). So if I move towards the top right, I might have to pass near (4,5), but since the enemy's body is empty, maybe it's safe. Alternatively, I could go for the apple at (2,1), which is closer. Let me calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (7,0) to (2,1): that's 5 steps left and 1 step up, so 6 moves. From (7,0) to (8,8): that's 1 step right and 8 steps up, which is 9 moves. So the apple at (2,1) is closer. But maybe the other apples are more valuable in the long run.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is also in the top middle. Let me see: from (7,0) to (6,7) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. So that's closer than (8,8). Hmm.\n\nI think I should prioritize the closest apple first to minimize the time spent moving. So (2,1) is the closest. But I need to make sure that moving towards it doesn't put me in danger of hitting the enemy or myself.\n\nLet me visualize the path. From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), then (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), then up to (2,1). That seems straightforward. But wait, the enemy is at (4,5), which is above (4,0). So if I go through (4,0), I'm passing below the enemy's position. Since the enemy's body is empty, I think that's okay. But I should check if the enemy might block me if it moves towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. From (7,0), move up to (7,1), then left to (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). That's 7 moves. But that's longer than the direct left path. So maybe the direct left path is better.\n\nWait, but moving left from (7,0) to (6,0) is possible. Let me check if any of those squares are blocked. The board state shows that at row 0, column 7 is my position, and row 1 has an apple at (2,1). So the squares from (7,0) to (2,0) are all empty except for the apple at (2,1). So moving left along the bottom row is safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,0), then (5,0), etc., seems safe. But I need to make sure that when I move, I don't run into myself. Since my snake's body is only at (7,0) right now, moving left won't cause me to hit myself unless I turn around, which I shouldn't do.\n\nWait, but my snake's body is just the head at (7,0), so moving left is fine. So the next move could be LEFT to (6,0). But wait, the apple is at (2,1), so I need to go up after reaching (2,0). Alternatively, maybe I can go up first to (7,1), but that's further away from the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple. Let me think about the other apples. The one at (8,8) is in the top right, which is a good spot, but it's far. The one at (6,7) is also in the top middle, which is closer than (8,8). Let me see the distance.\n\nFrom (7,0) to (6,7): moving left to (6,0), then up 7 times. That's 8 moves. Alternatively, moving up to (7,1), then left to (6,1), and so on. Either way, it's 8 moves. So maybe it's worth going for (6,7) because it's in a strategic position, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is even further. So maybe (6,7) is better. But I'm not sure if it's worth the longer path.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,1) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first. Let me think about the path again. From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), then up to (2,1). That's 6 moves. So I can reach it in 6 moves, which is better than the 8 moves for (6,7).\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (4,5). If I move towards (2,1), I'll pass through (4,0), which is directly below the enemy. But since the enemy's body is empty, I think that's okay. Unless the enemy moves towards me, but since it's just the head, I don't think it's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should avoid the area around (4,5) in case the enemy moves there. But since the enemy's body is empty, it's just the head, so unless it's moving down, I should be fine.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (2,1), I'll be moving along the bottom row, which is row 0. The enemy is at (4,5), which is in row 5, so it's not blocking my path. So moving left along row 0 is safe.\n\nSo, my options are to move LEFT to (6,0) or maybe move UP to (7,1). But moving LEFT seems more direct towards the apple at (2,1). However, I should also consider if moving UP might lead to a better position in the long run.\n\nWait, but moving UP from (7,0) would take me to (7,1), which is in row 1. From there, I can move towards the apple at (2,1) as well, but it's a longer path. So moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the apple at (8,8). Let me see: from (7,0), moving right to (8,0), then up 8 times to (8,8). That's 9 moves. But that's a long way, and I might be exposed to the enemy along the way.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (4,5), so if I move towards (8,8), I'll be moving along the right side, which is less likely to interfere with the enemy. But I'm not sure if that's the best move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (6,7). From (7,0), moving left to (6,0), then up 7 times. That's 8 moves. But again, I'm not sure if that's better than going for the closer apple at (2,1).\n\nI think the key is to maximize points while minimizing risk. Since the apple at (2,1) is the closest, I can reach it quickly and safely. So moving LEFT to (6,0) seems like the best first step.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (6,0), then next move LEFT to (5,0), and so on until I reach (2,0), then UP to (2,1). That seems safe. The enemy is at (4,5), so it's not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move UP first to (7,1), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving LEFT is better.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the enemy might block me in the future. Since the enemy is at (4,5), if I move towards (2,1), I'll be passing through (4,0), which is directly below the enemy. But since the enemy's body is empty, it's just the head, so unless it moves down, I should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move towards (6,7) because it's in a more central position, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,1) is only 6 moves away, so I can get it quickly. The other apples are further away, so it's better to get the closest one first.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to move LEFT to (6,0). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (2,1) without any immediate risks.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (7,0).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (2,1) is the closest, requiring 6 moves to reach.\n3. **Path Safety:** Moving left along the bottom row (from (7,0) to (2,0)) is safe as there are no obstacles or enemies blocking this path.\n4. **Avoiding Risks:** The enemy snake is at (4,5), which is not on the path to (2,1), so no risk of collision.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to maximize points quickly and safely.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is LEFT to (6,0) to start moving towards the closest apple at (2,1).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (7,0).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (2,1) is the closest, requiring 6 moves to reach.\n3. **Path Safety:** Moving left along the bottom row (from (7,0) to (2,0)) is safe as there are no obstacles or enemies blocking this path.\n4. **Avoiding Risks:** The enemy snake is at (4,5), which is not on the path to (2,1), so no risk of collision.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize the closest apple to maximize points quickly and safely.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</response>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (7,0). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (4,5) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (0,2), (9,7), (6,7), (8,8), and (2,1).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are placed.

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation. Our snake is currently at position (2, 5) and we've just moved left. We're still heading towards the apple at (0, 2), which is 2 units to the left from our current position.\n\nHowever, we should also consider the position of the other apples on the board, especially the one at (2, 1), which is now 0 units to the left and 4 units down from our current position. This apple is very close, and since we're already at the same x-coordinate, moving down towards it might be a safer option.\n\nAdditionally, we should keep an eye on Snake #1's movement, which is currently at position (5, 0). It's still far away, but we should be prepared to change direction if necessary.\n\nConsidering our current position and the proximity of the apple at (2, 1), I think it's a good idea to move down towards it. This will allow us to gain a point and potentially put us in a better position to navigate the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on Snake #1's movement and be prepared to change direction if necessary. Also, consider the possibility of moving towards the apple at (0, 2) if it becomes a safer option.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"
