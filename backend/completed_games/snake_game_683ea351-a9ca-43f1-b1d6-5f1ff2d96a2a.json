Enemy snake:\n   - Snake #2 is at (3, 9) and doesn't pose an immediate threat given its current location.\n\n3. Movement Considerations:\n   - Motion towards RIGHT now seems optimal to gradually close in towards the cluster of apples at the top right, specifically targeting the apple at (3, 6) first.\n   - Movement LEFT is no longer viable as the snake has already eaten the apple and cannot move outside the board.\n   - Movement UP also starts positioning towards the apple, but would need a subsequent rightward navigation to close in on (3, 6) or moving directly towards the far top apples.\n   - Movement DOWN isn't favorable as it moves the snake away from all nearby apples.\n\nStrategic Analysis:\n- Directly moving RIGHT leads me in a clear path to the next nearest apple at (3, 6), avoiding any immediate dangers. It's a gradual approach towards securing more points while keeping options open for further upward navigation.\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- Continue monitoring the enemy snake and adjust the approach based on its movement. If it maintains a safe distance, focus on reaching and securing the distant apples in the upper right.\n\nDecided Next Move: RIGHT to start navigating towards the apple at (3, 6)."

Next turn, I'll remind myself to think about the longer-term strategy of not only moving towards apples but positioning myself in a way to potentially block the other snake's movements."
