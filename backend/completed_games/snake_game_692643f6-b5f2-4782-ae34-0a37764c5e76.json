            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (6,5), which is in the middle of the board. The apples are located at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without running into any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3,6). That's two units to the left and one unit up from my current position. Another apple is at (8,3), which is quite far to the right and a bit down. There's also an apple at (0,0), which is all the way to the bottom left, and (0,4) which is a bit higher up on the left. The last apple is at (7,9), which is near the top right.\n\nI should probably prioritize the closest apples first. The apple at (3,6) is the closest, so maybe I should go for that. But I also need to check if moving towards it is safe. Let me see the path. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). Wait, but I'm at (6,5), so moving left would take me to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That seems possible, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (8,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That's on the other side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,6). Also, I don't see any other snakes nearby, so the main concern is walls and my own body.\n\nWait, do I have any body segments that might block me? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I should check if moving left would cause me to hit myself. If I'm at (6,5) and move left, my next position would be (5,5). I don't have any body parts there, so that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the apple at (0,0). That's at the bottom left, but it's quite far. The path would require moving left several times and then down, but since I'm already at (6,5), that's a longer distance. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (7,9). That's near the top right. From (6,5), moving right twice and then up four times. But that's a longer path, and I might not want to go that far if there are closer options.\n\nWait, the apple at (0,4) is also on the left side. It's at (0,4), which is directly above (0,0). From (6,5), moving left six times to get to (0,5), then up to (0,4). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference.\n\nBut I think the apple at (3,6) is the most accessible right now. Let me visualize the path again. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That's four moves. I need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nWait, when I move left from (6,5) to (5,5), is there any chance I'll hit my own body? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I think it's safe. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,4), which is far away, so no collision there.\n\nAlternatively, could I move up first? From (6,5) to (6,6), but that's not directly towards any apple. The apple at (3,6) is two units left and one up, so moving left seems more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left, I might be getting closer to the enemy snake, but since it's at (8,4), which is on the opposite side, I don't think that's a problem. Plus, the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head, and it's not moving towards me.\n\nWait, but I should also think about the other apples. The apple at (8,3) is at (8,3). From (6,5), moving right twice to (8,5), then down twice to (8,3). That's a possible path, but it's a bit longer. The apple at (7,9) is even further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the apple at (3,6) seems like the best target. So, my next move should be to move left towards (5,5), then continue left towards (3,5), and then up to (3,6). But since I can only move one step at a time, my immediate next move is to go left to (5,5).\n\nWait, but I'm at (6,5). If I move left, I go to (5,5). That's safe. Alternatively, could I move up first? Let me see. If I move up to (6,6), that's not directly towards any apple, but maybe it's a better position. However, the apple at (3,6) is two lefts from (5,5), so moving left seems more direct.\n\nI think moving left is the best option. It gets me closer to the apple and doesn't put me in any immediate danger. So, I'll move left to (5,5).\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT towards the apple at (3,6), ensuring safety and efficiency.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,5).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9).\n3. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (3,6) is the closest, requiring minimal moves.\n4. **Path Analysis:** Moving left from (6,5) to (5,5), then to (4,5), (3,5), and up to (3,6) is safe and clear of obstacles.\n5. **Safety Check:** No immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-collision.\n6. **Decision:** Prioritize the closest apple for efficiency.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (6,5), which is in the middle of the board. The apples are located at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without running into any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3,6). That's two units to the left and one unit up from my current position. Another apple is at (8,3), which is quite far to the right and a bit down. There's also an apple at (0,0), which is all the way to the bottom left, and (0,4) which is a bit higher up on the left. The last apple is at (7,9), which is near the top right.\n\nI should probably prioritize the closest apples first. The apple at (3,6) is the closest, so maybe I should go for that. But I also need to check if moving towards it is safe. Let me see the path. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). Wait, but I'm at (6,5), so moving left would take me to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That seems possible, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (8,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That's on the other side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,6). Also, I don't see any other snakes nearby, so the main concern is walls and my own body.\n\nWait, do I have any body segments that might block me? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I should check if moving left would cause me to hit myself. If I'm at (6,5) and move left, my next position would be (5,5). I don't have any body parts there, so that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the apple at (0,0). That's at the bottom left, but it's quite far. The path would require moving left several times and then down, but since I'm already at (6,5), that's a longer distance. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (7,9). That's near the top right. From (6,5), moving right twice and then up four times. But that's a longer path, and I might not want to go that far if there are closer options.\n\nWait, the apple at (0,4) is also on the left side. It's at (0,4), which is directly above (0,0). From (6,5), moving left six times to get to (0,5), then up to (0,4). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference.\n\nBut I think the apple at (3,6) is the most accessible right now. Let me visualize the path again. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That's four moves. I need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nWait, when I move left from (6,5) to (5,5), is there any chance I'll hit my own body? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I think it's safe. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,4), which is far away, so no collision there.\n\nAlternatively, could I move up first? From (6,5) to (6,6), but that's not directly towards any apple. The apple at (3,6) is two units left and one up, so moving left seems more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left, I might be getting closer to the enemy snake, but since it's at (8,4), which is on the opposite side, I don't think that's a problem. Plus, the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head, and it's not moving towards me.\n\nWait, but I should also think about the other apples. The apple at (8,3) is at (8,3). From (6,5), moving right twice to (8,5), then down twice to (8,3). That's a possible path, but it's a bit longer. The apple at (7,9) is even further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the apple at (3,6) seems like the best target. So, my next move should be to move left towards (5,5), then continue left towards (3,5), and then up to (3,6). But since I can only move one step at a time, my immediate next move is to go left to (5,5).\n\nWait, but I'm at (6,5). If I move left, I go to (5,5). That's safe. Alternatively, could I move up first? Let me see. If I move up to (6,6), that's not directly towards any apple, but maybe it's a better position. However, the apple at (3,6) is two lefts from (5,5), so moving left seems more direct.\n\nI think moving left is the best option. It gets me closer to the apple and doesn't put me in any immediate danger. So, I'll move left to (5,5).\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT towards the apple at (3,6), ensuring safety and efficiency.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,5).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9).\n3. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (3,6) is the closest, requiring minimal moves.\n4. **Path Analysis:** Moving left from (6,5) to (5,5), then to (4,5), (3,5), and up to (3,6) is safe and clear of obstacles.\n5. **Safety Check:** No immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-collision.\n6. **Decision:** Prioritize the closest apple for efficiency.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (6,5), which is in the middle of the board. The apples are located at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without running into any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3,6). That's two units to the left and one unit up from my current position. Another apple is at (8,3), which is quite far to the right and a bit down. There's also an apple at (0,0), which is all the way to the bottom left, and (0,4) which is a bit higher up on the left. The last apple is at (7,9), which is near the top right.\n\nI should probably prioritize the closest apples first. The apple at (3,6) is the closest, so maybe I should go for that. But I also need to check if moving towards it is safe. Let me see the path. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). Wait, but I'm at (6,5), so moving left would take me to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That seems possible, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (8,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That's on the other side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,6). Also, I don't see any other snakes nearby, so the main concern is walls and my own body.\n\nWait, do I have any body segments that might block me? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I should check if moving left would cause me to hit myself. If I'm at (6,5) and move left, my next position would be (5,5). I don't have any body parts there, so that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the apple at (0,0). That's at the bottom left, but it's quite far. The path would require moving left several times and then down, but since I'm already at (6,5), that's a longer distance. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (7,9). That's near the top right. From (6,5), moving right twice and then up four times. But that's a longer path, and I might not want to go that far if there are closer options.\n\nWait, the apple at (0,4) is also on the left side. It's at (0,4), which is directly above (0,0). From (6,5), moving left six times to get to (0,5), then up to (0,4). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference.\n\nBut I think the apple at (3,6) is the most accessible right now. Let me visualize the path again. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That's four moves. I need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nWait, when I move left from (6,5) to (5,5), is there any chance I'll hit my own body? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I think it's safe. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,4), which is far away, so no collision there.\n\nAlternatively, could I move up first? From (6,5) to (6,6), but that's not directly towards any apple. The apple at (3,6) is two units left and one up, so moving left seems more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left, I might be getting closer to the enemy snake, but since it's at (8,4), which is on the opposite side, I don't think that's a problem. Plus, the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head, and it's not moving towards me.\n\nWait, but I should also think about the other apples. The apple at (8,3) is at (8,3). From (6,5), moving right twice to (8,5), then down twice to (8,3). That's a possible path, but it's a bit longer. The apple at (7,9) is even further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the apple at (3,6) seems like the best target. So, my next move should be to move left towards (5,5), then continue left towards (3,5), and then up to (3,6). But since I can only move one step at a time, my immediate next move is to go left to (5,5).\n\nWait, but I'm at (6,5). If I move left, I go to (5,5). That's safe. Alternatively, could I move up first? Let me see. If I move up to (6,6), that's not directly towards any apple, but maybe it's a better position. However, the apple at (3,6) is two lefts from (5,5), so moving left seems more direct.\n\nI think moving left is the best option. It gets me closer to the apple and doesn't put me in any immediate danger. So, I'll move left to (5,5).\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT towards the apple at (3,6), ensuring safety and efficiency.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,5).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9).\n3. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (3,6) is the closest, requiring minimal moves.\n4. **Path Analysis:** Moving left from (6,5) to (5,5), then to (4,5), (3,5), and up to (3,6) is safe and clear of obstacles.\n5. **Safety Check:** No immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-collision.\n6. **Decision:** Prioritize the closest apple for efficiency.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

But since I can only move one step at a time, my immediate next move is to go left to (5,5).\n\nWait, but I'm at (6,5). If I move left, I go to (5,5). That's safe. Alternatively, could I move up first? Let me see. If I move up to (6,6), that's not directly towards any apple, but maybe it's a better position. However, the apple at (3,6) is two lefts from (5,5), so moving left seems more direct.\n\nI think moving left is the best option. It gets me closer to the apple and doesn't put me in any immediate danger. So, I'll move left to (5,5).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,5).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9).\n3. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (3,6) is the closest, requiring minimal moves.\n4. **Path Analysis:** Moving left from (6,5) to (5,5), then to (4,5), (3,5), and up to (3,6) is safe and clear of obstacles.\n5. **Safety Check:** No immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-collision.\n6. **Decision:** Prioritize the closest apple for efficiency.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (6,5), which is in the middle of the board. The apples are located at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without running into any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3,6). That's two units to the left and one unit up from my current position. Another apple is at (8,3), which is quite far to the right and a bit down. There's also an apple at (0,0), which is all the way to the bottom left, and (0,4) which is a bit higher up on the left. The last apple is at (7,9), which is near the top right.\n\nI should probably prioritize the closest apples first. The apple at (3,6) is the closest, so maybe I should go for that. But I also need to check if moving towards it is safe. Let me see the path. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). Wait, but I'm at (6,5), so moving left would take me to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That seems possible, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (8,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That's on the other side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,6). Also, I don't see any other snakes nearby, so the main concern is walls and my own body.\n\nWait, do I have any body segments that might block me? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I should check if moving left would cause me to hit myself. If I'm at (6,5) and move left, my next position would be (5,5). I don't have any body parts there, so that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the apple at (0,0). That's at the bottom left, but it's quite far. The path would require moving left several times and then down, but since I'm already at (6,5), that's a longer distance. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (7,9). That's near the top right. From (6,5), moving right twice and then up four times. But that's a longer path, and I might not want to go that far if there are closer options.\n\nWait, the apple at (0,4) is also on the left side. It's at (0,4), which is directly above (0,0). From (6,5), moving left six times to get to (0,5), then up to (0,4). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference.\n\nBut I think the apple at (3,6) is the most accessible right now. Let me visualize the path again. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That's four moves. I need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nWait, when I move left from (6,5) to (5,5), is there any chance I'll hit my own body? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I think it's safe.

That's two units to the left and one unit up from my current position. Another apple is at (8,3), which is quite far to the right and a bit down. There's also an apple at (0,0), which is all the way to the bottom left, and (0,4) which is a bit higher up on the left. The last apple is at (7,9), which is near the top right.\n\nI should probably prioritize the closest apples first. The apple at (3,6) is the closest, so maybe I should go for that. But I also need to check if moving towards it is safe. Let me see the path. From (6,5), moving left would take me to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That seems possible, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (8,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That's on the other side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,6). Also, I don't see any other snakes nearby, so the main concern is walls and my own body.\n\nWait, do I have any body segments that might block me? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I should check if moving left would cause me to hit myself. If I'm at (6,5) and move left, my next position would be (5,5). I don't have any body parts there, so that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the apple at (0,0). That's at the bottom left, but it's quite far. The path would require moving left several times and then down, but since I'm already at (6,5), that's a longer distance. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (7,9). That's near the top right. From (6,5), moving right twice and then up four times. But that's a longer path, and I might not want to go that far if there are closer options.\n\nWait, the apple at (0,4) is also on the left side. It's at (0,4), which is directly above (0,0). From (6,5), moving left six times to get to (0,5), then up to (0,4). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference.\n\nBut I think the apple at (3,6) is the most accessible right now. Let me visualize the path again. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That's four moves. I need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nWait, when I move left from (6,5) to (5,5), is there any chance I'll hit my own body? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I think it's safe. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,4), which is far away, so no collision there.\n\nAlternatively, could I move up first? From (6,5) to (6,6), but that's not directly towards any apple. The apple at (3,6) is two units left and one up, so moving left seems more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left, I might be getting closer to the enemy snake, but since it's at (8,4), which is on the opposite side, I don't think that's a problem. Plus, the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head, and it's not moving towards me.\n\nWait, but I should also think about the other apples. The apple at (8,3) is at (8,3). From (6,5), moving right twice to (8,5), then down twice to (8,3). That's a possible path, but it's a bit longer. The apple at (7,9) is even further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the apple at (3,6) seems like the best target. So, my next move should be to move left towards (5,5), then continue left towards (3,5), and then up to (3,6). But since I can only move one step at a time, my immediate next move is to go left to (5,5).\n\nWait, but I'm at (6,5). If I move left, I go to (5,5). That's safe. Alternatively, could I move up first? Let me see. If I move up to (6,6), that's not directly towards any apple, but maybe it's a better position. However, the apple at (3,6) is two lefts from (5,5), so moving left seems more direct.\n\nI think moving left is the best option. It gets me closer to the apple and doesn't put me in any immediate danger. So, I'll move left to (5,5).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,5).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9).\n3. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (3,6) is the closest, requiring minimal moves.\n4. **Path Analysis:** Moving left from (6,5) to (5,5), then to (4,5), (3,5), and up to (3,6) is safe and clear of obstacles.\n5. **Safety Check:** No immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-collision.\n6. **Decision:** Prioritize the closest apple for efficiency.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (6,5), which is in the middle of the board. The apples are located at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without running into any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3,6). That's two units to the left and one unit up from my current position. Another apple is at (8,3), which is quite far to the right and a bit down. There's also an apple at (0,0), which is all the way to the bottom left, and (0,4) which is a bit higher up on the left. The last apple is at (7,9), which is near the top right.\n\nI should probably prioritize the closest apples first. The apple at (3,6) is the closest, so maybe I should go for that. But I also need to check if moving towards it is safe. Let me see the path. From (6,5), moving left would take me to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That seems possible, but I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (8,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. That's on the other side of the board, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,6). Also, I don't see any other snakes nearby, so the main concern is walls and my own body.\n\nWait, do I have any body segments that might block me? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I should check if moving left would cause me to hit myself. If I'm at (6,5) and move left, my next position would be (5,5). I don't have any body parts there, so that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the apple at (0,0). That's at the bottom left, but it's quite far. The path would require moving left several times and then down, but since I'm already at (6,5), that's a longer distance. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (7,9). That's near the top right. From (6,5), moving right twice and then up four times. But that's a longer path, and I might not want to go that far if there are closer options.\n\nWait, the apple at (0,4) is also on the left side. It's at (0,4), which is directly above (0,0). From (6,5), moving left six times to get to (0,5), then up to (0,4). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference.\n\nBut I think the apple at (3,6) is the most accessible right now. Let me visualize the path again. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That's four moves. I need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nWait, when I move left from (6,5) to (5,5), is there any chance I'll hit my own body? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I think it's safe. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,4), which is far away, so no collision there.\n\nAlternatively, could I move up first? From (6,5) to (6,6), but that's not directly towards any apple. The apple at (3,6) is two units left and one up, so moving left seems more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left, I might be getting closer to the enemy snake, but since it's at (8,4), which is on the opposite side, I don't think that's a problem. Plus, the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head, and it's not moving towards me.\n\nWait, but I should also think about the other apples. The apple at (8,3) is at (8,3). From (6,5), moving right twice to (8,5), then down twice to (8,3). That's a possible path, but it's a bit longer. The apple at (7,9) is even further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the apple at (3,6) seems like the best target.

But that's a longer path, and I might not want to go that far if there are closer options.\n\nWait, the apple at (0,4) is also on the left side. It's at (0,4), which is directly above (0,0). From (6,5), moving left six times to get to (0,5), then up to (0,4). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference.\n\nBut I think the apple at (3,6) is the most accessible right now. Let me visualize the path again. From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That's four moves. I need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nWait, when I move left from (6,5) to (5,5), is there any chance I'll hit my own body? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I think it's safe. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,4), which is far away, so no collision there.\n\nAlternatively, could I move up first? From (6,5) to (6,6), but that's not directly towards any apple. The apple at (3,6) is two units left and one up, so moving left seems more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left, I might be getting closer to the enemy snake, but since it's at (8,4), which is on the opposite side, I don't think that's a problem. Plus, the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head, and it's not moving towards me.\n\nWait, but I should also think about the other apples. The apple at (8,3) is at (8,3). From (6,5), moving right twice to (8,5), then down twice to (8,3). That's a possible path, but it's a bit longer. The apple at (7,9) is even further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the apple at (3,6) seems like the best target. So, my next move should be to move left towards (5,5), then continue left towards (3,5), and then up to (3,6). But since I can only move one step at a time, my immediate next move is to go left to (5,5).\n\nWait, but I'm at (6,5). If I move left, I go to (5,5). That's safe. Alternatively, could I move up first? Let me see. If I move up to (6,6), that's not directly towards any apple, but maybe it's a better position. However, the apple at (3,6) is two lefts from (5,5), so moving left seems more direct.\n\nI think moving left is the best option. It gets me closer to the apple and doesn't put me in any immediate danger. So, I'll move left to (5,5).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,5).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9).\n3. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (3,6) is the closest, requiring minimal moves.\n4. **Path Analysis:** Moving left from (6,5) to (5,5), then to (4,5), (3,5), and up to (3,6) is safe and clear of obstacles.\n5. **Safety Check:** No immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-collision.\n6. **Decision:** Prioritize the closest apple for efficiency.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</response>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without running into any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3,6). That's two units to the left and one unit up from my current position. Another apple is at (8,3), which is quite far to the right and a bit down.

From (6,5), moving left to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), and then up to (3,6). That's four moves. I need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nWait, when I move left from (6,5) to (5,5), is there any chance I'll hit my own body? Since I just moved and my body is probably only a few segments, I think it's safe. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,4), which is far away, so no collision there.\n\nAlternatively, could I move up first? From (6,5) to (6,6), but that's not directly towards any apple. The apple at (3,6) is two units left and one up, so moving left seems more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left, I might be getting closer to the enemy snake, but since it's at (8,4), which is on the opposite side, I don't think that's a problem. Plus, the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head, and it's not moving towards me.\n\nWait, but I should also think about the other apples. The apple at (8,3) is at (8,3). From (6,5), moving right twice to (8,5), then down twice to (8,3). That's a possible path, but it's a bit longer. The apple at (7,9) is even further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the apple at (3,6) seems like the best target. So, my next move should be to move left towards (5,5), then continue left towards (3,5), and then up to (3,6). But since I can only move one step at a time, my immediate next move is to go left to (5,5).\n\nWait, but I'm at (6,5). If I move left, I go to (5,5). That's safe. Alternatively, could I move up first? Let me see. If I move up to (6,6), that's not directly towards any apple, but maybe it's a better position. However, the apple at (3,6) is two lefts from (5,5), so moving left seems more direct.\n\nI think moving left is the best option. It gets me closer to the apple and doesn't put me in any immediate danger. So, I'll move left to (5,5).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,5).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (3,6), (8,3), (0,0), (0,4), and (7,9).\n3. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (3,6) is the closest, requiring minimal moves.\n4. **Path Analysis:** Moving left from (6,5) to (5,5), then to (4,5), (3,5), and up to (3,6) is safe and clear of obstacles.\n5. **Safety Check:** No immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-collision.\n6. **Decision:** Prioritize the closest apple for efficiency.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"
