Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, ID 1, is currently at (3,2). There are apples at (5,5), (0,9), (3,0), (4,2), and (7,5). Hmm, I see there's an apple right next to me at (4,2). That's just one square to the right. Since I'm at (3,2), moving right would take me to (4,2), which is an apple. That seems like a good move because I can grow my snake and gain a point.\n\nLooking at the other apples, (3,0) is directly below me, two squares down. (5,5) is up and to the right, which might be a bit further. (7,5) is also further up. The apple at (0,9) is way to the left and top, probably too far for now. So the closest apple is definitely at (4,2). \n\nI should check for any obstacles. My snake is at (3,2), so moving right to (4,2) is possible unless there's another snake or part of my own body there. Looking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (3,8), which is far above me. There's no mention of any other parts of Snake #2's body, so it's likely just a single segment there. Also, my snake doesn't have any body parts mentioned, so I don't have to worry about running into myself.\n\nWait, the rules mention that if I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. So moving right to (4,2) should be safe and beneficial. I don't think I'll die because there's nothing blocking that path. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the direction I'm moving. My last move was direction none, so I need to pick a new direction. Since I'm moving from (3,2) to (4,2), that's moving right. So the next move should be RIGHT.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake because it's far away. So focusing on eating the apple at (4,2) is the best move. It's right next to me, and it's an easy point.\n\nNext turn, after eating that apple, I should look for the next closest apple. Maybe after that, I can go for (3,0) or (5,5). But for now, RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal next move is to the right to collect the apple at (4,2). This will allow me to grow and gain a point without any immediate threats.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
