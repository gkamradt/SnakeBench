Since we're both at the top row, I should try to create some distance between us to avoid potential collisions.\n\nConsidering these factors, my initial move should be to start moving down towards the apples while also creating distance from the enemy snake. \n\nMy strategy for the next few turns will be to move down and try to get closer to the apple at (4, 4), as it seems like a more direct path. I'll also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

The safest immediate move is to go UP, which will put some distance between my snake and the enemy snake, and also position me to potentially collect the apple at (4, 4) after I maneuver around it.\n\nAfter moving up, I will need to reassess the board to determine the best path to the apple at (7, 3), ensuring that I do not collide with the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: UP\n\nFor the next turn, my strategy will be to evaluate the enemy snake's movement and decide whether to continue towards the apple at (7, 3) or to collect the closer apple at (4, 4) first, depending on the positions of both snakes."
