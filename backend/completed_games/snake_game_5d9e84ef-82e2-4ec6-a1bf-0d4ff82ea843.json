This move not only increases the snake's length and score but also positions it advantageously for future apple collections.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

This snake\u2019s location doesn\u2019t impact my immediate movement towards the apple at (2, 7).\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n\n- The best immediate move is to go LEFT one square to reach and eat the apple at (2, 7). This move guarantees a safe collection of the apple, gaining a point and growing in size with no risks of collisions.\n- Post collecting this apple, reviewing the positions to ascertain the best route towards the next closest apple will be critical.
