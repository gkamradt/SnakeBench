The immediate goal was to claim the apple at (6, 5), where no enemy snake was mentioned to obstruct this path. \n\n**Immediate Strategy:**\n- Moving UP from the current position (6, 4) to (6, 5) is the optimal choice as it leads directly to an apple. This will help in growing the snake and increasing my score.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Upon moving UP and eating the apple at (6, 5), my next positions to consider will need to factor in both proximity to the next nearest apple and the positioning of Snake #2.\n- It's crucial to remain vigilant about Snake #2's movements which might block or create risks for future moves.\n\n**Future Moves:**\n- After consuming the apple at (6, 5), potential paths include either pursuing deeper vertical movement to avoid immediate conflict with Snake #2 or considering horizontal shifts to navigate towards other apples such as at (3, 5) or (3, 6). Exploring LEFT towards apples around (3, 5) and (3, 6) might be a good strategy once the immediate apple at (6, 5) is secured.\n\n**Risk Awareness:**\n- Ensuring not to find myself in a dead-end or getting too close to the boundaries or Snake #2 without escape routes.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP.**\nThis continues the plan to eat the apple at (6, 5) by moving upward from (6, 4), growing the snake, and positively contributing to the score. Further strategy will be developed based on the new position and the positions of other elements like apples and enemy snakes after this move."
