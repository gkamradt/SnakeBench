            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,8). There are apples at (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), and (9,5). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (4,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are towards the top. My position at (7,8) is towards the top-middle of the board.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I want to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nLet me plot out the positions:\n\n- My head: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n- Enemy snake: (4,4)\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- To (8,2): |7-8| + |8-2| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- To (7,5): |7-7| + |8-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (8,3): |7-8| + |8-3| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (9,5): |7-9| + |8-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,5) with a distance of 3. Then (9,5) at distance 5, and (8,2), (8,3), (9,4) at distances 7, 6, and 6 respectively.\n\nBut I need to think about more than just distance. I need to consider the path to each apple and whether there are any obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or potential for the path to lead me into a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . A . A\n\n- Row 4: . . . . 1 . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my head is at (7,8), which is row 8, column 7.\n\nI need to think about the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y coordinates.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y coordinates.\n\n- Left: towards lower X coordinates.\n\n- Right: towards higher X coordinates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (7,5):\n\n- Same X, lower Y by 3.\n\n- So, need to move down 3 steps.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there's no obstruction between (7,8) and (7,5).\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is empty except for the apple at (7,5). So, moving down to (7,5) seems straightforward.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nAfter eating (7,5), my tail will grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (4,4). If it's moving, it could potentially block my path or become a threat.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its direction or speed, I'll assume it's stationary for now.\n\nSo, let's consider going for (7,5) first.\n\nPath to (7,5):\n\n- Move down to (7,7)\n\n- Move down to (7,6)\n\n- Move down to (7,5)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (7,5), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or block my own path.\n\nThen, after (7,5), which apple to go for next?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,2), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nNow, from (7,5), let's calculate distances to these apples:\n\n- To (8,2): |7-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (8,3): |7-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (9,4): |7-9| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (9,5): |7-9| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nSo, the closest is (9,5) at distance 2.\n\nLet's consider path from (7,5) to (9,5):\n\n- Down to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Right to (9,4)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nBut that's distance 4, which is more than the direct path.\n\nWait, better path:\n\n- Right to (8,5)\n\n- Right to (9,5)\n\nThat's only 2 steps, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSo, after eating (7,5), go right to (8,5), then right to (9,5).\n\nThen, which apple next?\n\nRemaining apples: (8,2), (8,3), (9,4)\n\nFrom (9,5), distances:\n\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (8,3): |9-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (9,4): |9-9| + |5-4| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, closest is (9,4) at distance 1.\n\nPath: left to (9,4)\n\nThen, remaining apples: (8,2), (8,3)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (8,3): |9-8| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, go for (8,3) next.\n\nPath: left to (9,3), up to (8,3)\n\nThen, finally (8,2): left to (8,2)\n\nSo, overall path:\n\n1. (7,8) -> (7,5)\n\n2. (7,5) -> (9,5)\n\n3. (9,5) -> (9,4)\n\n4. (9,4) -> (8,3)\n\n5. (8,3) -> (8,2)\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can execute this without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I grow, my tail extends, so I need to ensure that I don't create a situation where my own body blocks the path.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (4,4), and I don't know its movement pattern. If it's stationary, that's one thing, but if it's moving, it could potentially block my path.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating apples that are farther away from the enemy snake to minimize interaction.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (8,2), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5) are all relatively far from the enemy at (4,4), while (7,5) is somewhat in the middle.\n\nBut, since (7,5) is the closest, and the path seems clear, maybe it's still the best option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (9,5) directly from (7,8), but that would require moving down and right, potentially closer to the enemy.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet's consider the positions:\n\n- My head: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n- Enemy: (4,4)\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the cluster of apples at (9,4) and (9,5), as they are close together and farther from the enemy.\n\nPath from (7,8) to (9,5):\n\n- Down to (7,7)\n\n- Down to (7,6)"

To (9,5): |7-9| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,5) with a distance of 2.\n\nBut, I need to consider the paths and potential blockages.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- My position is (7,7).\n\n- The apple at (7,5) is directly down from me.\n\nLet's see the path to (7,5):\n\n- Down to (7,6)\n\n- Down to (7,5)\n\nThis seems straightforward. After eating this apple, my tail will grow, so I need to ensure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nAfter eating (7,5), I should consider which apple to go for next. Let's recalculate distances from (7,5):\n\n1. To (8,2): |7-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. To (8,3): |7-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n3. To (9,4): |7-9| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n4. To (9,5): |7-9| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nSo, from (7,5), the closest apple is at (9,5), distance 2.\n\nPath to (9,5):\n\n- Right to (8,5)\n\n- Right to (9,5)\n\nAgain, this seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (9,5), my tail will grow again. Now, recalculate distances from (9,5):\n\n1. To (8,2): |9-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. To (8,3): |9-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n3. To (9,4): |9-9| + |5-4| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nClosest is (9,4), distance 1.\n\nPath: Left to (9,4)\n\nAfter eating (9,4), tail grows again. Remaining apples are at (8,2) and (8,3).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n1. To (8,2): |9-8| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n2. To (8,3): |9-8| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nClosest is (8,3), distance 2.\n\nPath: Left to (9,3), then up to (8,3)\n\nAfter eating (8,3), tail grows. Last apple at (8,2), distance 1 from (8,3).\n\nPath: Left to (8,2)\n\nSo, the overall path would be:\n\n1. Down to (7,6)\n\n2. Down to (7,5) - eat apple\n\n3. Right to (8,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5) - eat apple\n\n5. Left to (9,4) - eat apple\n\n6. Left to (9,3)\n\n7. Up to (8,3) - eat apple\n\n8. Left to (8,2) - eat apple\n\nI need to make sure that none of these moves put me in danger of hitting the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (5,4), and assuming it doesn't move (since I don't have information about its movement), it should not interfere with my path, as I'm moving down and to the right.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my own path. Since I'm moving in a general down-right direction, as long as I don't make any sharp turns back onto my own tail, I should be fine.\n\nAnother consideration is that after each apple, my body grows, so I need to make sure that the spaces I'm moving into are not occupied by my own body.\n\nGiven this plan, it seems feasible.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's a better order to eat the apples that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider starting with a different apple, say (9,5), which is relatively central and far from the enemy.\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7):\n\n- Down to (7,6)\n\n- Down to (7,5)\n\n- Right to (8,5)\n\n- Right to (9,5)\n\nThat's 4 moves.\n\nAfter eating (9,5), tail grows, and I need to consider which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,5), closest apples are (9,4) and (8,3), both distance 1.\n\nLet's say I go left to (9,4) - eat apple.\n\nThen, I can go left to (9,3), then up to (8,3) - eat apple.\n\nThen, left to (8,2) - eat apple.\n\nBut comparing this to the previous path, it's similar in length.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,5), I could go up to (8,5), then left to (8,4), then left to (8,3) - eat apple, etc.\n\nBut that might be longer.\n\nSo, the initial plan seems as good as any.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the first plan:\n\n1. Down to (7,6)\n\n2. Down to (7,5) - eat apple\n\n3. Right to (8,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5) - eat apple\n\n5. Left to (9,4) - eat apple\n\n6. Left to (9,3)\n\n7. Up to (8,3) - eat apple\n\n8. Left to (8,2) - eat apple\n\nFor this turn, I need to move down to (7,6).\n\nSo, my move is DOWN.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,8). There are apples at (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), and (9,5). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (4,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are towards the top. My position at (7,8) is towards the top-middle of the board.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I want to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nLet me plot out the positions:\n\n- My head: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n- Enemy snake: (4,4)\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- To (8,2): |7-8| + |8-2| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- To (7,5): |7-7| + |8-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (8,3): |7-8| + |8-3| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (9,5): |7-9| + |8-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,5) with a distance of 3. Then (9,5) at distance 5, and (8,2), (8,3), (9,4) at distances 7, 6, and 6 respectively.\n\nBut I need to think about more than just distance. I need to consider the path to each apple and whether there are any obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or potential for the path to lead me into a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . A . A\n\n- Row 4: . . . . 1 . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my head is at (7,8), which is row 8, column 7.\n\nI need to think about the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y coordinates.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y coordinates.\n\n- Left: towards lower X coordinates.\n\n- Right: towards higher X coordinates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (7,5):\n\n- Same X, lower Y by 3.\n\n- So, need to move down 3 steps.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there's no obstruction between (7,8) and (7,5).\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is empty except for the apple at (7,5). So, moving down to (7,5) seems straightforward.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nAfter eating (7,5), my tail will grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (4,4). If it's moving, it could potentially block my path or become a threat.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its direction or speed, I'll assume it's stationary for now.\n\nSo, let's consider going for (7,5) first.\n\nPath to (7,5):\n\n- Move down to (7,7)\n\n- Move down to (7,6)\n\n- Move down to (7,5)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (7,5), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or block my own path.\n\nThen, after (7,5), which apple to go for next?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,2), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nNow, from (7,5), let's calculate distances to these apples:\n\n- To (8,2): |7-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (8,3): |7-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (9,4): |7-9| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (9,5): |7-9| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nSo, the closest is (9,5) at distance 2.\n\nLet's consider path from (7,5) to (9,5):\n\n- Down to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Right to (9,4)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nBut that's distance 4, which is more than the direct path.\n\nWait, better path:\n\n- Right to (8,5)\n\n- Right to (9,5)\n\nThat's only 2 steps, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSo, after eating (7,5), go right to (8,5), then right to (9,5).\n\nThen, which apple next?\n\nRemaining apples: (8,2), (8,3), (9,4)\n\nFrom (9,5), distances:\n\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (8,3): |9-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (9,4): |9-9| + |5-4| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, closest is (9,4) at distance 1.\n\nPath: left to (9,4)\n\nThen, remaining apples: (8,2), (8,3)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (8,3): |9-8| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, go for (8,3) next.\n\nPath: left to (9,3), up to (8,3)\n\nThen, finally (8,2): left to (8,2)\n\nSo, overall path:\n\n1. (7,8) -> (7,5)\n\n2. (7,5) -> (9,5)\n\n3. (9,5) -> (9,4)\n\n4. (9,4) -> (8,3)\n\n5. (8,3) -> (8,2)\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can execute this without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I grow, my tail extends, so I need to ensure that I don't create a situation where my own body blocks the path.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (4,4), and I don't know its movement pattern. If it's stationary, that's one thing, but if it's moving, it could potentially block my path.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating apples that are farther away from the enemy snake to minimize interaction.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (8,2), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5) are all relatively far from the enemy at (4,4), while (7,5) is somewhat in the middle.\n\nBut, since (7,5) is the closest, and the path seems clear, maybe it's still the best option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (9,5) directly from (7,8), but that would require moving down and right, potentially closer to the enemy.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet's consider the positions:\n\n- My head: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n- Enemy: (4,4)\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the cluster of apples at (9,4) and (9,5), as they are close together and farther from the enemy.\n\nPath from (7,8) to (9,5):\n\n- Down to (7,7)\n\n- Down to (7,6)"

I'll need to clarify this.\n\nAssuming the board state is accurate, I'll consider my position as (7,7).\n\nNow, apples are at:\n\n- (8,2)\n\n- (7,5)\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (9,5)\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,4), which is (x=6, y=4), and it has no body parts.\n\nMy goal is to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or my own body.\n\nLet me consider the distances from my current position to each apple using Manhattan distance, since diagonal moves aren't allowed in Snake games.\n\nCalculating distances from (7,7):\n\n1. To (8,2): |7-8| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. To (7,5): |7-7| + |7-5| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n3. To (8,3): |7-8| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n4. To (9,4): |7-9| + |7-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. To (9,5): |7-9| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nThe closest apple is at (7,5) with a distance of 2.\n\nLet me look at the path to (7,5):\n\nFrom (7,7) down to (7,6), then down to (7,5).\n\nSo, two moves down.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,5), my tail will grow by one segment.\n\nNow, from (7,5), what's the next best apple to go for?\n\nLet's calculate distances from (7,5) to remaining apples:\n\n1. (8,2): |7-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. (8,3): |7-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n4. (9,5): |7-9| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple from (7,5) is (9,5) at a distance of 2.\n\nPath to (9,5):\n\nFrom (7,5), right to (8,5), then right to (9,5).\n\nAfter eating (9,5), my tail grows again.\n\nNow, from (9,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n1. (8,2): |9-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. (8,3): |9-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n3. (9,4): |9-9| + |5-4| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nClosest is (9,4) at a distance of 1.\n\nPath: left to (9,4).\n\nAfter eating (9,4), tail grows again.\n\nNow, from (9,4), distances to remaining apples:\n\n1. (8,2): |9-8| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n2. (8,3): |9-8| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nClosest is (8,3) at a distance of 2.\n\nPath: left to (9,3), then up to (8,3).\n\nAfter eating (8,3), tail grows again.\n\nFinally, from (8,3), distance to (8,2) is 1.\n\nPath: left to (8,2).\n\nSo, the overall path would be:\n\n(7,7) -> down to (7,6) -> down to (7,5) -> right to (8,5) -> right to (9,5) -> left to (9,4) -> left to (9,3) -> up to (8,3) -> left to (8,2).\n\nLet me visualize this path:\n\nStarting at (7,7):\n\n1. Down to (7,6)\n\n2. Down to (7,5) - eat apple\n\n3. Right to (8,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5) - eat apple\n\n5. Left to (9,4) - eat apple\n\n6. Left to (9,3)\n\n7. Up to (8,3) - eat apple\n\n8. Left to (8,2) - eat apple\n\nNow, I need to make sure that none of these moves put me in danger of hitting the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (6,4), and assuming it doesn't move (since I don't have information about its movement), it should not interfere with my path, as I'm moving down and to the right.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my own path. Since I'm moving in a general down-right direction, as long as I don't make any sharp turns back onto my own tail, I should be fine.\n\nAnother consideration is that after each apple, my body grows, so I need to make sure that the spaces I'm moving into are not occupied by my own body.\n\nGiven this plan, it seems feasible.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's a better order to eat the apples that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider starting with a different apple, say (9,5), which is relatively central and far from the enemy.\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7):\n\n- Down to (7,6)\n\n- Down to (7,5)\n\n- Right to (8,5)\n\n- Right to (9,5)\n\nThat's 4 moves.\n\nAfter eating (9,5), tail grows, and I need to consider which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,5), closest apples are (9,4) and (8,3), both distance 1.\n\nLet's say I go left to (9,4) - eat apple.\n\nThen, I can go left to (9,3), then up to (8,3) - eat apple.\n\nThen, left to (8,2) - eat apple.\n\nThis seems similar to the previous path.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,5), I could go up to (8,5), then left to (8,4), then left to (8,3) - eat apple, etc.\n\nBut that might be longer.\n\nSo, the initial plan seems as good as any.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the first plan:\n\n1. Down to (7,6)\n\n2. Down to (7,5) - eat apple\n\n3. Right to (8,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5) - eat apple\n\n5. Left to (9,4) - eat apple\n\n6. Left to (9,3)\n\n7. Up to (8,3) - eat apple\n\n8. Left to (8,2) - eat apple\n\nFor this turn, I need to move down to (7,6).\n\nSo, my move is DOWN.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,8). There are apples at (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), and (9,5). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (4,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are towards the top. My position at (7,8) is towards the top-middle of the board.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I want to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nLet me plot out the positions:\n\n- My head: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n- Enemy snake: (4,4)\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- To (8,2): |7-8| + |8-2| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- To (7,5): |7-7| + |8-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (8,3): |7-8| + |8-3| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (9,4): |7-9| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (9,5): |7-9| + |8-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,5) with a distance of 3. Then (9,5) at distance 5, and (8,2), (8,3), (9,4) at distances 7, 6, and 6 respectively.\n\nBut I need to think about more than just distance. I need to consider the path to each apple and whether there are any obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake or potential for the path to lead me into a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . A . A\n\n- Row 4: . . . . 1 . . . . A\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my head is at (7,8), which is row 8, column 7.\n\nI need to think about the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y coordinates.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y coordinates.\n\n- Left: towards lower X coordinates.\n\n- Right: towards higher X coordinates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (7,5):\n\n- Same X, lower Y by 3.\n\n- So, need to move down 3 steps.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there's no obstruction between (7,8) and (7,5).\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is empty except for the apple at (7,5). So, moving down to (7,5) seems straightforward.\n\nBut, after eating that apple, I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nAfter eating (7,5), my tail will grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (4,4). If it's moving, it could potentially block my path or become a threat.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its direction or speed, I'll assume it's stationary for now.\n\nSo, let's consider going for (7,5) first.\n\nPath to (7,5):\n\n- Move down to (7,7)\n\n- Move down to (7,6)\n\n- Move down to (7,5)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (7,5), my tail will grow, so I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or block my own path.\n\nThen, after (7,5), which apple to go for next?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,2), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nNow, from (7,5), let's calculate distances to these apples:\n\n- To (8,2): |7-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (8,3): |7-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (9,4): |7-9| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (9,5): |7-9| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nSo, the closest is (9,5) at distance 2.\n\nLet's consider path from (7,5) to (9,5):\n\n- Down to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Right to (9,4)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\nBut that's distance 4, which is more than the direct path.\n\nWait, better path:\n\n- Right to (8,5)\n\n- Right to (9,5)\n\nThat's only 2 steps, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSo, after eating (7,5), go right to (8,5), then right to (9,5).\n\nThen, which apple next?\n\nRemaining apples: (8,2), (8,3), (9,4)\n\nFrom (9,5), distances:\n\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (8,3): |9-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (9,4): |9-9| + |5-4| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, closest is (9,4) at distance 1.\n\nPath: left to (9,4)\n\nThen, remaining apples: (8,2), (8,3)\n\nFrom (9,4), distances:\n\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (8,3): |9-8| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, go for (8,3) next.\n\nPath: left to (9,3), up to (8,3)\n\nThen, finally (8,2): left to (8,2)\n\nSo, overall path:\n\n1. (7,8) -> (7,5)\n\n2. (7,5) -> (9,5)\n\n3. (9,5) -> (9,4)\n\n4. (9,4) -> (8,3)\n\n5. (8,3) -> (8,2)\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can execute this without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that as I grow, my tail extends, so I need to ensure that I don't create a situation where my own body blocks the path.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (4,4), and I don't know its movement pattern. If it's stationary, that's one thing, but if it's moving, it could potentially block my path.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating apples that are farther away from the enemy snake to minimize interaction.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (8,2), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5) are all relatively far from the enemy at (4,4), while (7,5) is somewhat in the middle.\n\nBut, since (7,5) is the closest, and the path seems clear, maybe it's still the best option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (9,5) directly from (7,8), but that would require moving down and right, potentially closer to the enemy.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet's consider the positions:\n\n- My head: (7,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,2), (7,5), (8,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n- Enemy: (4,4)\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the cluster of apples at (9,4) and (9,5), as they are close together and farther from the enemy.\n\nPath from (7,8) to (9,5):\n\n- Down to (7,7)\n\n- Down to (7,6)"

I'll assume the board state is correct, so I'm at (7,7).\n\nWait, actually, in the board state, row 6 is y=6, and row 7 is y=7. So, snake 2 is at (7,7), which is row 7, column 7.\n\nBut in the initial information, it says the snake is at (7,6). Maybe there's a mistake. I'll need to clarify this.\n\nAssuming the board state is accurate, I'll consider my position as (7,7).\n\nNow, apples are at:\n\n- (8,2)\n\n- (7,5)\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (9,5)\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,4), which is (x=6, y=4), and it has no body parts.\n\nMy goal is to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or my own body.\n\nLet me consider the distances from my current position to each apple using Manhattan distance, since diagonal moves aren't allowed in Snake games.\n\nCalculating distances from (7,7):\n\n1. To (8,2): |7-8| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. To (7,5): |7-7| + |7-5| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n3. To (8,3): |7-8| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n4. To (9,4): |7-9| + |7-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. To (9,5): |7-9| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nThe closest apple is at (7,5) with a distance of 2.\n\nLet me look at the path to (7,5):\n\nFrom (7,7) down to (7,6), then down to (7,5).\n\nSo, two moves down.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,5), my tail will grow by one segment.\n\nNow, from (7,5), what's the next best apple to go for?\n\nLet's calculate distances from (7,5) to remaining apples:\n\n1. (8,2): |7-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. (8,3): |7-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n3. (9,4): |7-9| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n4. (9,5): |7-9| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple from (7,5) is (9,5) at a distance of 2.\n\nPath to (9,5):\n\nFrom (7,5), right to (8,5), then right to (9,5).\n\nAfter eating (9,5), my tail grows again.\n\nNow, from (9,5), distances to remaining apples:\n\n1. (8,2): |9-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. (8,3): |9-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n3. (9,4): |9-9| + |5-4| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nClosest is (9,4) at a distance of 1.\n\nPath: left to (9,4).\n\nAfter eating (9,4), tail grows again.\n\nNow, from (9,4), distances to remaining apples:\n\n1. (8,2): |9-8| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n2. (8,3): |9-8| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nClosest is (8,3) at a distance of 2.\n\nPath: left to (9,3), then up to (8,3).\n\nAfter eating (8,3), tail grows again.\n\nFinally, from (8,3), distance to (8,2) is 1.\n\nPath: left to (8,2).\n\nSo, the overall path would be:\n\n(7,7) -> down to (7,6) -> down to (7,5) -> right to (8,5) -> right to (9,5) -> left to (9,4) -> left to (9,3) -> up to (8,3) -> left to (8,2).\n\nLet me visualize this path:\n\nStarting at (7,7):\n\n1. Down to (7,6)\n\n2. Down to (7,5) - eat apple\n\n3. Right to (8,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5) - eat apple\n\n5. Left to (9,4) - eat apple\n\n6. Left to (9,3)\n\n7. Up to (8,3) - eat apple\n\n8. Left to (8,2) - eat apple\n\nNow, I need to make sure that none of these moves put me in danger of hitting the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (6,4), and assuming it doesn't move (since I don't have information about its movement), it should not interfere with my path, as I'm moving down and to the right.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my own path. Since I'm moving in a general down-right direction, as long as I don't make any sharp turns back onto my own tail, I should be fine.\n\nAnother consideration is that after each apple, my body grows, so I need to make sure that the spaces I'm moving into are not occupied by my own body.\n\nGiven this plan, it seems feasible.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's a better order to eat the apples that might be safer or more efficient.\n\nLet's consider starting with a different apple, say (9,5), which is relatively central and far from the enemy.\n\nPath to (9,5) from (7,7):\n\n- Down to (7,6)\n\n- Down to (7,5)\n\n- Right to (8,5)\n\n- Right to (9,5)\n\nThat's 4 moves.\n\nAfter eating (9,5), tail grows, and I need to consider which apple to go for next.\n\nFrom (9,5), closest apples are (9,4) and (8,3), both distance 1.\n\nLet's say I go left to (9,4) - eat apple.\n\nThen, I can go left to (9,3), then up to (8,3) - eat apple.\n\nThen, left to (8,2) - eat apple.\n\nThis seems similar to the previous path.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,5), I could go up to (8,5), then left to (8,4), then left to (8,3) - eat apple, etc.\n\nBut that might be longer.\n\nSo, the initial plan seems as good as any.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the first plan:\n\n1. Down to (7,6)\n\n2. Down to (7,5) - eat apple\n\n3. Right to (8,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5) - eat apple\n\n5. Left to (9,4) - eat apple\n\n6. Left to (9,3)\n\n7. Up to (8,3) - eat apple\n\n8. Left to (8,2) - eat apple\n\nFor this turn, I need to move down to (7,6).\n\nSo, my move is DOWN.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

The enemy\u2019s head sits at (7,5) with a body segment at (7,6), so moving UP directly is dangerous.\n\nLooking at distances from (7,4):\n\u2022 (8,3) is 1 right and 1 down (distance 2).\n\u2022 (9,4) is 2 right (distance 2).\n\nBoth are attractive, but we must ensure we steer clear of the enemy. Since moving UP would put us directly into the enemy\u2019s head at (7,5) and moving LEFT (which would be our backward direction given our last move was RIGHT) is not allowed, our safe choices are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf we choose DOWN from (7,4), we\u2019d go to (7,3). That might then allow us to approach apple (8,3) on the next turn by moving RIGHT. However, moving DOWN takes us further from the center; our position may give the enemy extra room, and the apple at (8,3) would still require a turn change.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT from (7,4), we go to (8,4). That square is safe and positions us closer to both (9,4) and (8,3); from (8,4) a RIGHT move takes us to (9,4) or a DOWN move takes us to (8,3). This option leaves multiple avenues open while staying clear of the enemy positioned at (7,5).\n\nThus, my plan is:\n1. Move RIGHT now from (7,4) to (8,4).\n2. On the following turn, decide between moving RIGHT to grab (9,4) or DOWN to grab (8,3).\n\nBased on this analysis, I\u2019ll choose to move RIGHT.\n\nMy next move: RIGHT."

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right.\n\nFirst, let's understand my current situation:\n\n- My snake (ID 2) is at position (7,5), according to the initial information, but looking at the board state, it seems like I'm at (7,7). There's a bit of confusion here. Let me double-check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, that seems off. In the board state, '2' is at row 6, column 7, which would be coordinates (6,7). But according to the initial information, my snake is at (7,5). There's definitely a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me try to reconcile this:\n\n- The board is labeled with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom.\n\n- Columns are labeled from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\n- So, position (7,5) would be row 7, column 5.\n\nBut in the board state provided, it seems like '2' is at row 6, column 7.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the initial position provided or in the board state.
