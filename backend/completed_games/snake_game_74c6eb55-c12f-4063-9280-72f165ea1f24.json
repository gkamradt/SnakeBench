There are apples at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (6,1), and (0,7). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,8) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (5,1), which is in the lower part of the board.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . .

There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (6,1). It's right next to me, so it's easy to reach. If I eat that, I grow longer, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nBut I also need to be careful of the enemy snake. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and I don't know its length or direction yet. Since its body is listed as empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples. There's one at (9,2), which is far to the right, and (3,2), which is to the left, and (0,7), which is above and to the left, and (0,0), which is at the bottom left.\n\nGiven that I'm at (5,1), the apple at (6,1) is immediate, (3,2) is a couple of steps left and up, (9,2) is several steps to the right, (0,7) is up and left, and (0,0) is down and left.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\n- If I go right to (6,1), I eat the apple there and grow longer.\n\n- Then, I could consider moving up or down from there.\n\n- If I move up to (6,2), there's another apple at (9,2), so I could continue right to (9,2).\n\n- Alternatively, I could go left to (3,2), but that would involve passing through (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n\n- I need to make sure that in this path, I don't cross my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements as well. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and it might be moving down towards the apples as well.\n\nLet me try to prioritize the apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move right to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\n- Then, perhaps move left to (3,2), but that's a long way.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move left to (5,1), but that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (6,1) would be (5,1), which is my current position. That wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nIf I move right from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, then my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,2), my tail moves to (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move right to (7,2), my tail moves to (6,2), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail as I move.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nLet's assume that the enemy snake is trying to eat apples as well and might be moving towards them.\n\nI need to find a path that allows me to eat multiple apples before the enemy can reach them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to block the enemy snake from certain paths.\n\nBut perhaps that's too advanced for now. Maybe I should just focus on eating as many apples as possible without concerning myself with the enemy too much.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nCurrent position: (5,1)\n\nPossible immediate moves:\n\n- Right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\n- Up to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Down to (5,0), which has an apple at (0,0), but that's a long way.\n\n- Left to (4,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (6,1) seems like the best immediate choice.\n\nSo, let's say I move right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Move up to (6,2), towards the apple at (9,2).\n\nOption B: Move down to (6,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nOption C: Move left to (5,1), but that's where my tail is.\n\nWait, but my tail is now at (5,1), since I just moved from there.\n\nSo, moving left to (5,1) would be into my own tail, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (6,1).\n\nSo, options are only up or down.\n\nUp to (6,2) seems better, as there's an apple at (9,2) in that direction.\n\nSo, move up to (6,2).\n\nNow, my tail moves from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nNext, I can move right to (7,2), then (8,2), then (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (3,2), but I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, let's think about the path:\n\n- Start at (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1), eat apple, tail is now at (5,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2), tail moves to (6,1)\n\n- Right to (7,2), tail moves to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2), tail moves to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (9,2), eat apple, tail moves to (8,2)\n\nNow, I'm at (9,2), and I can consider moving left towards (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that as I move left, I don't run into my own body.\n\nMy body is now at (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), and possibly more depending on how much I've grown.\n\nWait, every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, but I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the first apple at (6,1), my snake grows, so my tail stays where it was before that move.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move on that turn; instead, your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, when I move from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was before that move, at (5,1), but since I've eaten an apple, my tail doesn't move on this turn.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move immediately; your snake just grows longer.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer by one segment.\n\nThen, when I move up to (6,2), my tail remains at (5,1), because the growth means that my tail doesn't move forward until the next move without eating.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify how Snake works in this context"

Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,7) with a body at (0,8).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots, so empty.\n\n- Row 8: T (tail of snake 1), dots, etc.\n\n- Row 7: 1 (head of snake 1), dots.\n\n- Row 6: dots.\n\n- Row 5: dots.\n\n- Row 4: dots, an apple at (5,4).\n\n- Row 3: dots.\n\n- Row 2: dots, apples at (3,2) and (9,2).\n\n- Row 1: dots, my snake at (5,2), apple at (6,1).\n\n- Row 0: apple at (0,0), dots.\n\nColumns: 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,2), and there are apples around: at (6,1) to the right and down, at (3,2) to the left, and at (5,4) above me.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. Let's think strategically.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (6,1).\n\n- It's right next to me; just one move to the right.\n\n- After eating it, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to bump into my own tail.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving up to (6,3), but there's no apple there immediately.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (5,4).\n\n- That's two steps up from my current position.\n\n- I need to make sure there's a clear path up there without running into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (3,2).\n\n- That's two steps to the left.\n\n- Again, need to ensure the path is clear.\n\nConsidering the positions:\n\n- The enemy snake is at (0,7), which is up and to the left, and its body is at (0,8).\n\n- It might be moving down towards the apples, but I don't know its exact movement pattern.\n\n- I should assume it's a threat in the upper left area.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's safer to go for the apple at (6,1) first since it's right next to me and away from the enemy's current position.\n\nLet's plan a sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (6,2) to eat the apple at (6,1).\n\n- Wait, no, (6,1) is at row 1, column 6.\n\n- My current position is (5,2), which is row 2, column 5.\n\n- To move right from (5,2) to (6,2), but the apple is at (6,1), which is down from there.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board description:\n\n- Rows are from 0 to 9, with row 0 at the bottom.\n\n- Columns are from 0 to 9, with column 0 on the left.\n\nSo, my position is (5,2), which is row 2, column 5.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is row 1, column 6.\n\nSo, to get from (5,2) to (6,1), I need to move down to (5,1), then right to (6,1).\n\nWait, but in the board, row numbers increase upwards, so row 0 is bottom, row 9 is top.\n\nSo, moving up increases the row number, moving down decreases it.\n\nSo, from (5,2) to (6,1):\n\n- Move down to (5,1), then right to (6,1).\n\nGot it.\n\nSo, first, move down to (5,1), eat the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, no, (6,1) is to the right and down.\n\nWait, I'm at (5,2), and (6,1) is right and down.\n\nSo, to get there, I need to move right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 1 is below row 2.\n\nSo, from (5,2), moving right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut in terms of coordinates, moving right increases the x-coordinate, moving down decreases the y-coordinate.\n\nWait, in the standard Cartesian plane, increasing y goes up, but in this grid, increasing y goes up, with row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, coordinates (x,y), where x is column, y is row.\n\nSo, from (5,2), right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\nAlright, so plan:\n\n- Move right to (6,2).\n\n- Then down to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nBut in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is until the next move without eating.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move on that move; your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer, and my tail remains at (6,2).\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move right to (7,1), my tail stays at (6,2).\n\nWait, I need to be careful with the mechanics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nI'm at (5,2).\n\nApples at:\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (0,0)\n\nEnemy snake at (0,7), body at (0,8).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption A: Go for (6,1)\n\n- Move right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\n- Eat the apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (6,2), then right towards (9,2).\n\nOption B: Go for (3,2)\n\n- Move left to (4,2), then to (3,2).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- But the enemy is on the left side, so maybe not the best idea.\n\nOption C: Go for (5,4)\n\n- Move up to (5,3), then to (5,4).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- This might bring me closer to the enemy, but it's a straight path upwards.\n\nOption D: Go for (9,2)\n\n- Move right to (6,2), then to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- This seems safe, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nOption E: Go for (0,0)\n\n- Move down to (5,1), then left to (0,1), then down to (0,0).\n\n- This would take a long time and might put me in harm's way.\n\nConsidering these, perhaps the best option is to go for (9,2), as it's far from the enemy and allows me to collect multiple apples in a row.\n\nLet's plan that path:\n\n1. Move right to (6,2).\n\n2. Then right to (7,2).\n\n3. Then right to (8,2).\n\n4. Then right to (9,2), eating the apple there.\n\n5. Then, perhaps move left towards (3,2), but that would be a long path.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (3,2), which is to the left.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), I could move up to (9,3), but there are no apples there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating (5,4) after (9,2).\n\nBut that would require moving left to (5,2), then up to (5,4).\n\nThat seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should prioritize eating (5,4) first.\n\nLet's consider that:\n\n1. Move up to (5,3).\n\n2. Then up to (5,4), eating the apple.\n\n3. Then, perhaps move right or left.\n\nBut the enemy is on the left side, so moving right might be safer.\n\nWait, but moving right from (5,4) would take me towards (6,4), but there are no apples there.\n\nMaybe not the best option.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,4), I could move down to (5,3), then right to (6,3), but again, no apples there.\n\nPerhaps going for (9,2) is still the better choice.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nEnemy is at (0,7), body at (0,8).\n\nAssuming it's moving down towards the apples, it might head towards (0,6), then (0,5), and so on.\n\nIf that's"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,1). There are apples at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (6,1), and (0,7). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,8) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (5,1), which is in the lower part of the board.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . .

There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (6,1). It's right next to me, so it's easy to reach. If I eat that, I grow longer, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nBut I also need to be careful of the enemy snake. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and I don't know its length or direction yet. Since its body is listed as empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples. There's one at (9,2), which is far to the right, and (3,2), which is to the left, and (0,7), which is above and to the left, and (0,0), which is at the bottom left.\n\nGiven that I'm at (5,1), the apple at (6,1) is immediate, (3,2) is a couple of steps left and up, (9,2) is several steps to the right, (0,7) is up and left, and (0,0) is down and left.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\n- If I go right to (6,1), I eat the apple there and grow longer.\n\n- Then, I could consider moving up or down from there.\n\n- If I move up to (6,2), there's another apple at (9,2), so I could continue right to (9,2).\n\n- Alternatively, I could go left to (3,2), but that would involve passing through (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n\n- I need to make sure that in this path, I don't cross my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements as well. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and it might be moving down towards the apples as well.\n\nLet me try to prioritize the apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move right to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\n- Then, perhaps move left to (3,2), but that's a long way.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move left to (5,1), but that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (6,1) would be (5,1), which is my current position. That wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nIf I move right from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, then my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,2), my tail moves to (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move right to (7,2), my tail moves to (6,2), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail as I move.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nLet's assume that the enemy snake is trying to eat apples as well and might be moving towards them.\n\nI need to find a path that allows me to eat multiple apples before the enemy can reach them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to block the enemy snake from certain paths.\n\nBut perhaps that's too advanced for now. Maybe I should just focus on eating as many apples as possible without concerning myself with the enemy too much.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nCurrent position: (5,1)\n\nPossible immediate moves:\n\n- Right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\n- Up to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Down to (5,0), which has an apple at (0,0), but that's a long way.\n\n- Left to (4,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (6,1) seems like the best immediate choice.\n\nSo, let's say I move right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Move up to (6,2), towards the apple at (9,2).\n\nOption B: Move down to (6,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nOption C: Move left to (5,1), but that's where my tail is.\n\nWait, but my tail is now at (5,1), since I just moved from there.\n\nSo, moving left to (5,1) would be into my own tail, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (6,1).\n\nSo, options are only up or down.\n\nUp to (6,2) seems better, as there's an apple at (9,2) in that direction.\n\nSo, move up to (6,2).\n\nNow, my tail moves from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nNext, I can move right to (7,2), then (8,2), then (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (3,2), but I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, let's think about the path:\n\n- Start at (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1), eat apple, tail is now at (5,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2), tail moves to (6,1)\n\n- Right to (7,2), tail moves to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2), tail moves to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (9,2), eat apple, tail moves to (8,2)\n\nNow, I'm at (9,2), and I can consider moving left towards (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that as I move left, I don't run into my own body.\n\nMy body is now at (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), and possibly more depending on how much I've grown.\n\nWait, every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, but I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the first apple at (6,1), my snake grows, so my tail stays where it was before that move.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move on that turn; instead, your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, when I move from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was before that move, at (5,1), but since I've eaten an apple, my tail doesn't move on this turn.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move immediately; your snake just grows longer.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer by one segment.\n\nThen, when I move up to (6,2), my tail remains at (5,1), because the growth means that my tail doesn't move forward until the next move without eating.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify how Snake works in this context"

Move right to (6,2) to eat the apple at (6,1).\n\n- Wait, no, (6,1) is at row 1, column 6.\n\n- My current position is (5,2), which is row 2, column 5.\n\n- To move right from (5,2) to (6,2), but the apple is at (6,1), which is down from there.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board description:\n\n- Rows are from 0 to 9, with row 0 at the bottom.\n\n- Columns are from 0 to 9, with column 0 on the left.\n\nSo, my position is (5,2), which is row 2, column 5.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is row 1, column 6.\n\nSo, to get from (5,2) to (6,1), I need to move down to (5,1), then right to (6,1).\n\nWait, but in the board, row numbers increase upwards, so row 0 is bottom, row 9 is top.\n\nSo, moving up increases the row number, moving down decreases it.\n\nSo, from (5,2) to (6,1):\n\n- Move down to (5,1), then right to (6,1).\n\nGot it.\n\nSo, first, move down to (5,1), eat the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, no, (6,1) is to the right and down.\n\nWait, I'm at (5,2), and (6,1) is right and down.\n\nSo, to get there, I need to move right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 1 is below row 2.\n\nSo, from (5,2), moving right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut in terms of coordinates, moving right increases the x-coordinate, moving down decreases the y-coordinate.\n\nWait, in the standard Cartesian plane, increasing y goes up, but in this grid, increasing y goes up, with row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, coordinates (x,y), where x is column, y is row.\n\nSo, from (5,2), right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\nAlright, so plan:\n\n- Move right to (6,2).\n\n- Then down to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nBut in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is until the next move without eating.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move on that move; your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer, and my tail remains at (6,2).\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move right to (7,1), my tail stays at (6,2).\n\nWait, I need to be careful with the mechanics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nI'm at (5,2).\n\nApples at:\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (0,0)\n\nEnemy snake at (0,7), body at (0,8).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption A: Go for (6,1)\n\n- Move right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\n- Eat the apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (6,2), then right towards (9,2).\n\nOption B: Go for (3,2)\n\n- Move left to (4,2), then to (3,2).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- But the enemy is on the left side, so maybe not the best idea.\n\nOption C: Go for (5,4)\n\n- Move up to (5,3), then to (5,4).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- This might bring me closer to the enemy, but it's a straight path upwards.\n\nOption D: Go for (9,2)\n\n- Move right to (6,2), then to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- This seems safe, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nOption E: Go for (0,0)\n\n- Move down to (5,1), then left to (0,1), then down to (0,0).\n\n- This would take a long time and might put me in harm's way.\n\nConsidering these, perhaps the best option is to go for (9,2), as it's far from the enemy and allows me to collect multiple apples in a row.\n\nLet's plan that path:\n\n1. Move right to (6,2).\n\n2. Then right to (7,2).\n\n3. Then right to (8,2).\n\n4. Then right to (9,2), eating the apple there.\n\n5. Then, perhaps move left towards (3,2), but that would be a long path.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (3,2), which is to the left.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), I could move up to (9,3), but there are no apples there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating (5,4) after (9,2).\n\nBut that would require moving left to (5,2), then up to (5,4).\n\nThat seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should prioritize eating (5,4) first.\n\nLet's consider that:\n\n1. Move up to (5,3).\n\n2. Then up to (5,4), eating the apple.\n\n3. Then, perhaps move right or left.\n\nBut the enemy is on the left side, so moving right might be safer.\n\nWait, but moving right from (5,4) would take me towards (6,4), but there are no apples there.\n\nMaybe not the best option.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,4), I could move down to (5,3), then right to (6,3), but again, no apples there.\n\nPerhaps going for (9,2) is still the better choice.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nEnemy is at (0,7), body at (0,8).\n\nAssuming it's moving down towards the apples, it might head towards (0,6), then (0,5), and so on.\n\nIf that's"

There are apples at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (6,1), and (0,7). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,8) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (5,1), which is in the lower part of the board.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . .

There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (6,1). It's right next to me, so it's easy to reach. If I eat that, I grow longer, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nBut I also need to be careful of the enemy snake. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and I don't know its length or direction yet. Since its body is listed as empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples. There's one at (9,2), which is far to the right, and (3,2), which is to the left, and (0,7), which is above and to the left, and (0,0), which is at the bottom left.\n\nGiven that I'm at (5,1), the apple at (6,1) is immediate, (3,2) is a couple of steps left and up, (9,2) is several steps to the right, (0,7) is up and left, and (0,0) is down and left.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\n- If I go right to (6,1), I eat the apple there and grow longer.\n\n- Then, I could consider moving up or down from there.\n\n- If I move up to (6,2), there's another apple at (9,2), so I could continue right to (9,2).\n\n- Alternatively, I could go left to (3,2), but that would involve passing through (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n\n- I need to make sure that in this path, I don't cross my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements as well. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and it might be moving down towards the apples as well.\n\nLet me try to prioritize the apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move right to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\n- Then, perhaps move left to (3,2), but that's a long way.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move left to (5,1), but that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (6,1) would be (5,1), which is my current position. That wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nIf I move right from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, then my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,2), my tail moves to (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move right to (7,2), my tail moves to (6,2), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail as I move.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nLet's assume that the enemy snake is trying to eat apples as well and might be moving towards them.\n\nI need to find a path that allows me to eat multiple apples before the enemy can reach them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to block the enemy snake from certain paths.\n\nBut perhaps that's too advanced for now. Maybe I should just focus on eating as many apples as possible without concerning myself with the enemy too much.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nCurrent position: (5,1)\n\nPossible immediate moves:\n\n- Right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\n- Up to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Down to (5,0), which has an apple at (0,0), but that's a long way.\n\n- Left to (4,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (6,1) seems like the best immediate choice.\n\nSo, let's say I move right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Move up to (6,2), towards the apple at (9,2).\n\nOption B: Move down to (6,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nOption C: Move left to (5,1), but that's where my tail is.\n\nWait, but my tail is now at (5,1), since I just moved from there.\n\nSo, moving left to (5,1) would be into my own tail, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (6,1).\n\nSo, options are only up or down.\n\nUp to (6,2) seems better, as there's an apple at (9,2) in that direction.\n\nSo, move up to (6,2).\n\nNow, my tail moves from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nNext, I can move right to (7,2), then (8,2), then (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (3,2), but I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, let's think about the path:\n\n- Start at (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1), eat apple, tail is now at (5,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2), tail moves to (6,1)\n\n- Right to (7,2), tail moves to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2), tail moves to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (9,2), eat apple, tail moves to (8,2)\n\nNow, I'm at (9,2), and I can consider moving left towards (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that as I move left, I don't run into my own body.\n\nMy body is now at (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), and possibly more depending on how much I've grown.\n\nWait, every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, but I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the first apple at (6,1), my snake grows, so my tail stays where it was before that move.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move on that turn; instead, your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, when I move from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was before that move, at (5,1), but since I've eaten an apple, my tail doesn't move on this turn.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move immediately; your snake just grows longer.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer by one segment.\n\nThen, when I move up to (6,2), my tail remains at (5,1), because the growth means that my tail doesn't move forward until the next move without eating.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify how Snake works in this context"

Let's think strategically.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (6,1).\n\n- It's right next to me; just one move to the right.\n\n- After eating it, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to bump into my own tail.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving up to (6,3), but there's no apple there immediately.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (5,4).\n\n- That's two steps up from my current position.\n\n- I need to make sure there's a clear path up there without running into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (3,2).\n\n- That's two steps to the left.\n\n- Again, need to ensure the path is clear.\n\nConsidering the positions:\n\n- The enemy snake is at (0,7), which is up and to the left, and its body is at (0,8).\n\n- It might be moving down towards the apples, but I don't know its exact movement pattern.\n\n- I should assume it's a threat in the upper left area.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's safer to go for the apple at (6,1) first since it's right next to me and away from the enemy's current position.\n\nLet's plan a sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (6,2) to eat the apple at (6,1).\n\n- Wait, no, (6,1) is at row 1, column 6.\n\n- My current position is (5,2), which is row 2, column 5.\n\n- To move right from (5,2) to (6,2), but the apple is at (6,1), which is down from there.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board description:\n\n- Rows are from 0 to 9, with row 0 at the bottom.\n\n- Columns are from 0 to 9, with column 0 on the left.\n\nSo, my position is (5,2), which is row 2, column 5.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is row 1, column 6.\n\nSo, to get from (5,2) to (6,1), I need to move down to (5,1), then right to (6,1).\n\nWait, but in the board, row numbers increase upwards, so row 0 is bottom, row 9 is top.\n\nSo, moving up increases the row number, moving down decreases it.\n\nSo, from (5,2), moving right to (6,2), then down to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nBut in Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows by one segment, so your tail remains where it is until you move again without eating.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows by one segment, so your tail stays in place until you move again without eating.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer, and my tail remains at (6,2).\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move right to (7,1), my tail stays at (6,2).\n\nWait, I need to be careful with the mechanics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nI'm at (5,2).\n\nApples at:\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (0,0)\n\nEnemy snake at (0,7), body at (0,8).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption A: Go for (6,1)\n\n- Move right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\n- Eat the apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (6,2), then right towards (9,2).\n\nOption B: Go for (3,2)\n\n- Move left to (4,2), then to (3,2).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- But the enemy is on the left side, so maybe not the best idea.\n\nOption C: Go for (5,4)\n\n- Move up to (5,3), then to (5,4).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- This might bring me closer to the enemy, but it's a straight path upwards.\n\nOption D: Go for (9,2)\n\n- Move right to (6,2), then to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2).\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\n- This seems safe, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nOption E: Go for (0,0)\n\n- Move down to (5,1), then left to (0,1), then down to (0,0).\n\n- This would take a long time and might put me in harm's way.\n\nConsidering these, perhaps the best option is to go for (9,2), as it's far from the enemy and allows me to collect multiple apples in a row.\n\nLet's plan that path:\n\n1. Move right to (6,2).\n\n2. Then right to (7,2).\n\n3. Then right to (8,2).\n\n4. Then right to (9,2), eating the apple there.\n\n5. Then, perhaps move left towards (3,2), but that would be a long path.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (3,2), which is to the left.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), I could move up to (9,3), but there are no apples there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating (5,4) after (9,2).\n\nBut that would require moving left to (5,2), then up to (5,4).\n\nThat seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), I could move down to (9,1), then left towards (6,1), but that apple is already eaten.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different strategy.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nEnemy is at (0,7), body at (0,8).\n\nAssuming it's moving down towards the apples, it might head towards (0,6), then (0,5), and so on.\n\nIf that's the case, it could be heading towards the apple at (0,0).\n\nBut I'm planning to go towards (9,2), which is on the opposite side.\n\nSo, as long as I stay away from the enemy's path, I should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for the apple at (5,4) first to get some height advantage.\n\nLet's consider that:\n\n1. Move up to (5,3).\n\n2. Then up to (5,4), eating the apple.\n\n- Now, I can see better what's above me.\n\n- The enemy is at (0,7), so moving up might bring me closer to it.\n\n- But if I move to (5,4), I'm still far from the enemy.\n\n- From there, I can move right or left.\n\n- Moving right to (6,4), but there are no apples there.\n\n- Moving left to (4,4), but again, no apples.\n\n- Then, perhaps down to (4,3), but that seems aimless.\n\n- It might be better to go for the apples on the same row.\n\nWait, perhaps a better plan is to go for (3,2), eat that apple, then go for (9,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is closer to the enemy, which is a concern.\n\nAlternatively, go for (9,2), then (6,1), then (5,4), then (3,2), and finally (0,0).\n\nThat seems like a logical sequence, maximizing distance from the enemy.\n\nSo, first, go right to (6,2), then\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nI decide to move RIGHT to (6,"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,1). There are apples at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (6,1), and (0,7). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,8) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (5,1), which is in the lower part of the board.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . .

There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (6,1). It's right next to me, so it's easy to reach. If I eat that, I grow longer, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nBut I also need to be careful of the enemy snake. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and I don't know its length or direction yet. Since its body is listed as empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples. There's one at (9,2), which is far to the right, and (3,2), which is to the left, and (0,7), which is above and to the left, and (0,0), which is at the bottom left.\n\nGiven that I'm at (5,1), the apple at (6,1) is immediate, (3,2) is a couple of steps left and up, (9,2) is several steps to the right, (0,7) is up and left, and (0,0) is down and left.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\n- If I go right to (6,1), I eat the apple there and grow longer.\n\n- Then, I could consider moving up or down from there.\n\n- If I move up to (6,2), there's another apple at (9,2), so I could continue right to (9,2).\n\n- Alternatively, I could go left to (3,2), but that would involve passing through (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n\n- I need to make sure that in this path, I don't cross my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements as well. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and it might be moving down towards the apples as well.\n\nLet me try to prioritize the apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move right to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\n- Then, perhaps move left to (3,2), but that's a long way.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move left to (5,1), but that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (6,1) would be (5,1), which is my current position. That wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nIf I move right from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, then my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,2), my tail moves to (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move right to (7,2), my tail moves to (6,2), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail as I move.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nLet's assume that the enemy snake is trying to eat apples as well and might be moving towards them.\n\nI need to find a path that allows me to eat multiple apples before the enemy can reach them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to block the enemy snake from certain paths.\n\nBut perhaps that's too advanced for now. Maybe I should just focus on eating as many apples as possible without concerning myself with the enemy too much.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nCurrent position: (5,1)\n\nPossible immediate moves:\n\n- Right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\n- Up to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Down to (5,0), which has an apple at (0,0), but that's a long way.\n\n- Left to (4,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (6,1) seems like the best immediate choice.\n\nSo, let's say I move right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Move up to (6,2), towards the apple at (9,2).\n\nOption B: Move down to (6,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nOption C: Move left to (5,1), but that's where my tail is.\n\nWait, but my tail is now at (5,1), since I just moved from there.\n\nSo, moving left to (5,1) would be into my own tail, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (6,1).\n\nSo, options are only up or down.\n\nUp to (6,2) seems better, as there's an apple at (9,2) in that direction.\n\nSo, move up to (6,2).\n\nNow, my tail moves from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nNext, I can move right to (7,2), then (8,2), then (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (3,2), but I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, let's think about the path:\n\n- Start at (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1), eat apple, tail is now at (5,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2), tail moves to (6,1)\n\n- Right to (7,2), tail moves to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2), tail moves to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (9,2), eat apple, tail moves to (8,2)\n\nNow, I'm at (9,2), and I can consider moving left towards (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that as I move left, I don't run into my own body.\n\nMy body is now at (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), and possibly more depending on how much I've grown.\n\nWait, every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, but I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the first apple at (6,1), my snake grows, so my tail stays where it was before that move.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move on that turn; instead, your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, when I move from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was before that move, at (5,1), but since I've eaten an apple, my tail doesn't move on this turn.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move immediately; your snake just grows longer.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer by one segment.\n\nThen, when I move up to (6,2), my tail remains at (5,1), because the growth means that my tail doesn't move forward until the next move without eating.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify how Snake works in this context"

The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right.\n\nApples are located at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (5,4), and (4,0). So, there are multiple apples to go after.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, snake #1, at position (0,4) with its body at (0,5). I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots, empty.\n\n- Row 8: T (tail of snake 1), dots.\n\n- Row 7: 1 (head of snake 1), dots.\n\n- Row 6: dots.\n\n- Row 5: dots.\n\n- Row 4: dots, apple at (5,4).\n\n- Row 3: dots.\n\n- Row 2: dots, apples at (3,2) and (9,2).\n\n- Row 1: dots, my snake at (7,1), apple at (6,1).\n\n- Row 0: apple at (0,0), dots.\n\nColumns: 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,1), and there are apples at (6,1), (3,2), (9,2), (5,4), and (4,0).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,1): move left to (6,1), that's one step left.\n\n- (3,2): move left to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then left to (3,2). That's a few steps.\n\n- (9,2): move up to (7,2), then right to (9,2). That's two steps.\n\n- (5,4): move up to (7,2), then up to (7,4), then left to (5,4). That's three steps.\n\n- (4,0): move down to (7,0), then left to (4,0). That's two steps.\n\nConsidering the positions, the apple at (6,1) is right next to me, so it's the easiest to get. After eating it, I can decide where to go next.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0,4), which is up and to the left. Its body is at (0,5). I don't know its movement pattern, but I should assume it might be moving down towards lower rows.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (6,1), I move left to (6,1), eat it, and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving up to (6,2), and perhaps towards (9,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (9,2) directly. To get there, I can move up to (7,2), then right to (9,2). That's two moves.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear. If I move up to (7,2), is there any obstruction? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the board, row 2 has dots, with apples at (3,2) and (9,2). So, (7,2) should be empty.\n\nThen, moving right to (9,2), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut, considering that the enemy is on the left side, going to the right might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (5,4), which is up and to the left, but that's closer to the enemy.\n\nI think it's better to prioritize apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nSo, perhaps go for (9,2) first, then (6,1), then (5,4), and so on.\n\nWait, but (6,1) is closer than (9,2). Maybe I should go for (6,1) first, then (9,2).\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Move left to (6,1), eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move up to (6,2).\n\n3. Then move right to (9,2), eating the apple there.\n\n4. Then maybe move up to (9,4), but there's no apple there.\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Move up to (7,2).\n\n2. Then right to (9,2), eating the apple.\n\n3. Then down to (9,1), then left to (6,1), eating the apple.\n\nBut this seems longer.\n\nOption 3:\n\n1. Move right to (8,1), then up to (8,2), then right to (9,2), eating the apple.\n\nBut that seems less direct.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the positions.\n\nI'm at (7,1). To get to (9,2), I can move up to (7,2), then right to (9,2).\n\nBut, moving up to (7,2):\n\n- Is (7,2) occupied? It seems empty, as per the board.\n\n- Then, moving right to (9,2):\n\n- (8,2) and (9,2) should be empty except for the apple.\n\nSo, that should be fine.\n\nBut, moving up to (7,2), I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards that spot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (0,4), it might be moving down.\n\nBut, it's hard to predict its exact path.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps going for the closest apple first is better.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,1), eating the apple, then moving up to (6,2), then right to (9,2), eating another apple.\n\nThis way, I'm moving away from the enemy potentially.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,2), then right to (9,2).\n\nBoth seem plausible.\n\nI think I'll go with moving up to (7,2), then right to (9,2).\n\nBut, to do that, I need to first move up to (7,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (7,2).\n\nThen, on the next move, right to (9,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for another apple.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or the enemy.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (7,2) seems safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving up.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nI decide to move UP to (7,2).\n\n**End of response.**"

There are apples at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (6,1), and (0,7). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,8) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (5,1), which is in the lower part of the board.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . .

There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (6,1). It's right next to me, so it's easy to reach. If I eat that, I grow longer, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nBut I also need to be careful of the enemy snake. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and I don't know its length or direction yet. Since its body is listed as empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples. There's one at (9,2), which is far to the right, and (3,2), which is to the left, and (0,7), which is above and to the left, and (0,0), which is at the bottom left.\n\nGiven that I'm at (5,1), the apple at (6,1) is immediate, (3,2) is a couple of steps left and up, (9,2) is several steps to the right, (0,7) is up and left, and (0,0) is down and left.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\n- If I go right to (6,1), I eat the apple there and grow longer.\n\n- Then, I could consider moving up or down from there.\n\n- If I move up to (6,2), there's another apple at (9,2), so I could continue right to (9,2).\n\n- Alternatively, I could go left to (3,2), but that would involve passing through (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n\n- I need to make sure that in this path, I don't cross my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements as well. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and it might be moving down towards the apples as well.\n\nLet me try to prioritize the apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move right to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\n- Then, perhaps move left to (3,2), but that's a long way.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move left to (5,1), but that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (6,1) would be (5,1), which is my current position. That wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nIf I move right from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, then my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,2), my tail moves to (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move right to (7,2), my tail moves to (6,2), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail as I move.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nLet's assume that the enemy snake is trying to eat apples as well and might be moving towards them.\n\nI need to find a path that allows me to eat multiple apples before the enemy can reach them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to block the enemy snake from certain paths.\n\nBut perhaps that's too advanced for now. Maybe I should just focus on eating as many apples as possible without concerning myself with the enemy too much.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nCurrent position: (5,1)\n\nPossible immediate moves:\n\n- Right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\n- Up to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Down to (5,0), which has an apple at (0,0), but that's a long way.\n\n- Left to (4,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (6,1) seems like the best immediate choice.\n\nSo, let's say I move right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Move up to (6,2), towards the apple at (9,2).\n\nOption B: Move down to (6,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nOption C: Move left to (5,1), but that's where my tail is.\n\nWait, but my tail is now at (5,1), since I just moved from there.\n\nSo, moving left to (5,1) would be into my own tail, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (6,1).\n\nSo, options are only up or down.\n\nUp to (6,2) seems better, as there's an apple at (9,2) in that direction.\n\nSo, move up to (6,2).\n\nNow, my tail moves from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nNext, I can move right to (7,2), then (8,2), then (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (3,2), but I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, let's think about the path:\n\n- Start at (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1), eat apple, tail is now at (5,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2), tail moves to (6,1)\n\n- Right to (7,2), tail moves to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2), tail moves to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (9,2), eat apple, tail moves to (8,2)\n\nNow, I'm at (9,2), and I can consider moving left towards (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that as I move left, I don't run into my own body.\n\nMy body is now at (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), and possibly more depending on how much I've grown.\n\nWait, every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, but I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the first apple at (6,1), my snake grows, so my tail stays where it was before that move.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move on that turn; instead, your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, when I move from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was before that move, at (5,1), but since I've eaten an apple, my tail doesn't move on this turn.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move immediately; your snake just grows longer.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer by one segment.\n\nThen, when I move up to (6,2), my tail remains at (5,1), because the growth means that my tail doesn't move forward until the next move without eating.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify how Snake works in this context"

Let's think strategically.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (6,1).\n\n- It's right next to me; just one move to the right.\n\n- After eating it, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to bump into my own tail.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving up to (6,3), but there's no apple there immediately.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (5,4).\n\n- That's two steps up from my current position.\n\n- I need to make sure there's a clear path up there without running into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (3,2).\n\n- That's two steps to the left.\n\n- Again, need to ensure the path is clear.\n\nConsidering the positions:\n\n- The enemy snake is at (0,7), which is up and to the left, and its body is at (0,8).\n\n- It might be moving down towards the apples, but I don't know its exact movement pattern.\n\n- I should assume it's a threat in the upper left area.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's safer to go for the apple at (6,1) first since it's right next to me and away from the enemy's current position.\n\nLet's plan a sequence:\n\n1.

I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots, empty.\n\n- Row 8: T (tail of snake 1), dots.\n\n- Row 7: 1 (head of snake 1), dots.\n\n- Row 6: dots.\n\n- Row 5: dots.\n\n- Row 4: dots, apple at (5,4).\n\n- Row 3: dots.\n\n- Row 2: dots, apples at (3,2) and (9,2).\n\n- Row 1: dots, my snake at (7,1), apple at (6,1).\n\n- Row 0: apple at (0,0), dots.\n\nColumns: 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,1), and there are apples at (6,1), (3,2), (9,2), (5,4), and (4,0).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,1): move left to (6,1), that's one step left.\n\n- (3,2): move left to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then left to (3,2). That's a few steps.\n\n- (9,2): move up to (7,2), then right to (9,2). That's two steps.\n\n- (5,4): move up to (7,2), then up to (7,4), then left to (5,4). That's three steps.\n\n- (4,0): move down to (7,0), then left to (4,0). That's two steps.\n\nConsidering the positions, the apple at (6,1) is right next to me, so it's the easiest to get. After eating it, I can decide where to go next.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0,4), which is up and to the left. Its body is at (0,5). I don't know its movement pattern, but I should assume it might be moving down towards lower rows.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (6,1), I move left to (6,1), eat it, and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving up to (6,2), and perhaps towards (9,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (9,2) directly. To get there, I can move up to (7,2), then right to (9,2). That's two moves.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear. If I move up to (7,2), is there any obstruction? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the board, row 2 has dots, with apples at (3,2) and (9,2). So, (7,2) should be empty.\n\nThen, moving right to (9,2), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut, considering that the enemy is on the left side, going to the right might be safer.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (5,4), which is up and to the left, but that's closer to the enemy.\n\nI think it's better to prioritize apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nSo, perhaps go for (9,2) first, then (6,1), then (5,4), and so on.\n\nWait, but (6,1) is closer than (9,2). Maybe I should go for (6,1) first, then (9,2).\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Move left to (6,1), eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move up to (6,2).\n\n3. Then move right to (9,2), eating the apple there.\n\n4. Then maybe move up to (9,4), but there's no apple there.\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Move up to (7,2).\n\n2. Then right to (9,2), eating the apple.\n\n3. Then down to (9,1), then left to (6,1), eating the apple.\n\nBut this seems longer.\n\nOption 3:\n\n1. Move right to (8,1), then up to (8,2), then right to (9,2), eating the apple.\n\nBut that seems less direct.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the positions.\n\nI'm at (7,1). To get to (9,2), I can move up to (7,2), then right to (9,2).\n\nBut, moving up to (7,2):\n\n- Is (7,2) occupied? It seems empty, as per the board.\n\n- Then, moving right to (9,2):\n\n- (8,2) and (9,2) should be empty except for the apple.\n\nSo, that should be fine.\n\nBut, moving up to (7,2), I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards that spot.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (0,4), it might be moving down.\n\nBut, it's hard to predict its exact path.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps going for the closest apple first is better.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,1), eating the apple, then moving up to (6,2), then right to (9,2), eating another apple.\n\nThis way, I'm moving away from the enemy potentially.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,2), then right to (9,2).\n\nBoth seem plausible.\n\nI think I'll go with moving up to (7,2), then right to (9,2).\n\nBut, to do that, I need to first move up to (7,2).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (7,2).\n\nThen, on the next move, right to (9,2).\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for another apple.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or the enemy.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (7,2) seems safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving up.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nI decide to move UP to (7,2).\n\n**End of response.**"

The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right.\n\nApples are located at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (5,4), and (4,0). So, there are multiple apples to go after.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, snake #1, at position (0,3) with its body at (0,4). I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots, empty.\n\n- Row 8: dots.\n\n- Row 7: dots.\n\n- Row 6: dots.\n\n- Row 5: dots.\n\n- Row 4: dots, apple at (5,4).\n\n- Row 3: dots.\n\n- Row 2: dots, apples at (3,2) and (9,2).\n\n- Row 1: dots, my snake at (7,1).\n\n- Row 0: apple at (0,0), dots.\n\nColumns: 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,2), and there are apples at (3,2), (9,2), (5,4), and (4,0). There's also an apple at (0,0).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances to each apple:\n\n- (3,2): move left to (3,2), that's four steps left.\n\n- (9,2): move right to (9,2), that's two steps right.\n\n- (5,4): move up to (7,4), then left to (5,4), that's two steps up and two steps left.\n\n- (4,0): move down to (7,0), then left to (4,0), that's two steps down and three steps left.\n\n- (0,0): move down to (7,0), then left to (0,0), that's two steps down and seven steps left.\n\nConsidering the positions, the apple at (9,2) is the closest, only two steps to the right.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0,3), which is up and to the left. Its body is at (0,4). I don't know its movement pattern, but I should assume it might be moving down towards lower rows.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (9,2), I move right to (9,2), eat it, and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving up or down for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (3,2), but that's further to the left, closer to the enemy.\n\nI think it's better to prioritize apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nSo, going for (9,2) first makes sense.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I can consider moving up to (9,4), but there's no apple there, or moving down to (9,0), but there's an apple at (0,0), which is far away.\n\nAlternatively, I can move to (5,4) next.\n\nBut, considering the positions, moving to (9,2) and then down to (9,0) might not be efficient, as (5,4) is closer.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (5,4). So, after (9,2), I can move up to (5,4), but that would require moving left and up, which might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving down to (7,0) after (9,2), but that's further.\n\nI think the best approach is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,2), then consider moving to (5,4), and finally to (0,0).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (9,2) first, then move up to (9,4), but there's no apple there. So, maybe move left to (5,4).\n\nWait, (5,4) is at (5,4), so from (9,2), I can move up to (9,4), but that's off the board. Wait, y goes from 0 to 9, with 9 being the top.\n\nWait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, row 9 is y=9, row 8 is y=8, and so on, down to row 0 is y=0.\n\nSo, moving up increases y, moving down decreases y.\n\nSo, from (7,2), moving up to (7,3), then (7,4), and so on.\n\nSimilarly, moving right increases x, left decreases x.\n\nSo, from (7,2), to (9,2), I need to move right twice.\n\nThen, to (5,4), I would need to move left four times to (5,2), then up two times to (5,4).\n\nThat seems a bit long, and I might be exposed to the enemy during that movement.\n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,2), I can consider moving up to (9,4), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, the apple is at (5,4), which is at column 5, row 4.\n\nFrom (9,2), moving left to (5,2), then up to (5,4).\n\nThat's four left and two up.\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I need to make sure the enemy isn't in that area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (4,0) after (9,2).\n\nFrom (9,2), move down to (9,0), then left to (4,0).\n\nBut (9,0) is off the board, since y starts at 0.\n\nWait, y=0 is the bottom row.\n\nSo, from (9,2), moving down to (9,1), then (9,0), then left to (4,0).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy.\n\nI think the best approach is to prioritize apples that are closer and in a safer direction.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (3,2) first, since it's on the same row, and then moving to (9,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is to the left, closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for (9,2) first, moving right to (9,2), eating it, then moving up to (9,4), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, the apple is at (5,4), which is at column 5, row 4.\n\nFrom (9,2), moving up to (9,4), but that's off the board.\n\nWait, y=9 is the top, y=0 is the bottom.\n\nSo, from (9,2), moving up to (9,3), then (9,4), but there's no apple at (9,4).\n\nI need to go to (5,4), which is at column 5, row 4.\n\nFrom (9,2), moving left to (5,2), then up to (5,4).\n\nThat would be safer, as I'm moving away from the enemy.\n\nBut moving left from (9,2) to (5,2) is four steps left, then up two steps.\n\nDuring that movement, I need to ensure that the enemy isn't in my path.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (5,4) directly from (7,2).\n\nFrom (7,2), moving up to (7,4), then left to (5,4).\n\nThat's two up and two left.\n\nBut (7,4) is empty, and (5,4) has an apple.\n\nSo, that could be a viable path.\n\nBut, I need to consider which apple to go for first.\n\nIf I go for (9,2) first, I can grow longer, which might help in reaching other apples.\n\nAlternatively, going for (5,4) first might be better strategically.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nMy snake is at (7,2).\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (4,0)\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,3), body at (0,4).\n\nI need to prioritize apples that are easier to reach and safer.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (9,2) first, as it's closer and farther from the enemy.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move right to (9,2), eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, move up to (9,4), but there's no apple there, so maybe move left to (5,4), eating the apple at (5,4).\n\n3. Then, consider moving down to (5,0), but there's an apple at (4,0), so maybe left to (4,4), then down to (4,0).\n\n4. Finally, move to (0,0).\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), move left to (5,2), then up to (5,4), eating the apple.\n\nThen, move down to (5,0), then left"

There are apples at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (6,1), and (0,7). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,8) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (5,1), which is in the lower part of the board.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . .

There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my points by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (6,1). It's right next to me, so it's easy to reach. If I eat that, I grow longer, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nBut I also need to be careful of the enemy snake. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and I don't know its length or direction yet. Since its body is listed as empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples. There's one at (9,2), which is far to the right, and (3,2), which is to the left, and (0,7), which is above and to the left, and (0,0), which is at the bottom left.\n\nGiven that I'm at (5,1), the apple at (6,1) is immediate, (3,2) is a couple of steps left and up, (9,2) is several steps to the right, (0,7) is up and left, and (0,0) is down and left.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\n- If I go right to (6,1), I eat the apple there and grow longer.\n\n- Then, I could consider moving up or down from there.\n\n- If I move up to (6,2), there's another apple at (9,2), so I could continue right to (9,2).\n\n- Alternatively, I could go left to (3,2), but that would involve passing through (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n\n- I need to make sure that in this path, I don't cross my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements as well. Snake 1 is at (0,8), and it might be moving down towards the apples as well.\n\nLet me try to prioritize the apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move right to (7,2), (8,2), (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\n- Then, perhaps move left to (3,2), but that's a long way.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Eat (6,1)\n\n- Move left to (5,1), but that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, moving left from (6,1) would be (5,1), which is my current position. That wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nIf I move right from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, then my tail will be at (5,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,2), my tail moves to (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move right to (7,2), my tail moves to (6,2), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail as I move.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nLet's assume that the enemy snake is trying to eat apples as well and might be moving towards them.\n\nI need to find a path that allows me to eat multiple apples before the enemy can reach them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to block the enemy snake from certain paths.\n\nBut perhaps that's too advanced for now. Maybe I should just focus on eating as many apples as possible without concerning myself with the enemy too much.\n\nLet me try to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nCurrent position: (5,1)\n\nPossible immediate moves:\n\n- Right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\n- Up to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Down to (5,0), which has an apple at (0,0), but that's a long way.\n\n- Left to (4,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (6,1) seems like the best immediate choice.\n\nSo, let's say I move right to (6,1), eating the apple there.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption A: Move up to (6,2), towards the apple at (9,2).\n\nOption B: Move down to (6,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nOption C: Move left to (5,1), but that's where my tail is.\n\nWait, but my tail is now at (5,1), since I just moved from there.\n\nSo, moving left to (5,1) would be into my own tail, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (6,1).\n\nSo, options are only up or down.\n\nUp to (6,2) seems better, as there's an apple at (9,2) in that direction.\n\nSo, move up to (6,2).\n\nNow, my tail moves from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nNext, I can move right to (7,2), then (8,2), then (9,2) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (3,2), but I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, let's think about the path:\n\n- Start at (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1), eat apple, tail is now at (5,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2), tail moves to (6,1)\n\n- Right to (7,2), tail moves to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2), tail moves to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (9,2), eat apple, tail moves to (8,2)\n\nNow, I'm at (9,2), and I can consider moving left towards (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that as I move left, I don't run into my own body.\n\nMy body is now at (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), and possibly more depending on how much I've grown.\n\nWait, every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, but I need to keep track of my body parts.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating the first apple at (6,1), my snake grows, so my tail stays where it was before that move.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to think more carefully.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move on that turn; instead, your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, when I move from (5,1) to (6,1), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was before that move, at (5,1), but since I've eaten an apple, my tail doesn't move on this turn.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move immediately; your snake just grows longer.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,1), my snake is now longer by one segment.\n\nThen, when I move up to (6,2), my tail remains at (5,1), because the growth means that my tail doesn't move forward until the next move without eating.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify how Snake works in this context"

Then, perhaps move left towards (3,2), but that would be a long path.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (3,2), which is to the left.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), I could move up to (9,3), but there are no apples there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating (5,4) after (9,2).\n\nBut that would require moving left to (5,2), then up to (5,4).\n\nThat seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), I could move down to (9,1), then left towards (6,1), but that apple is already eaten.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different strategy.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nEnemy is at (0,7), body at (0,8).\n\nAssuming it's moving down towards the apples, it might head towards (0,6), then (0,5), and so on.\n\nIf that's the case, it could be heading towards the apple at (0,0).\n\nBut I'm planning to go towards (9,2), which is on the opposite side.\n\nSo, as long as I stay away from the enemy's path, I should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for the apple at (5,4) first to get some height advantage.\n\nLet's consider that:\n\n1. Move up to (5,3).\n\n2. Then up to (5,4), eating the apple.\n\n- Now, I can see better what's above me.\n\n- The enemy is at (0,7), so moving up might bring me closer to it.\n\n- But if I move to (5,4), I'm still far from the enemy.\n\n- From there, I can move right or left.\n\n- Moving right to (6,4), but there are no apples there.\n\n- Moving left to (4,4), but again, no apples.\n\n- Then, perhaps down to (4,3), but that seems aimless.\n\n- It might be better to go for the apples on the same row.\n\nWait, perhaps a better plan is to go for (3,2), eat that apple, then go for (9,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is closer to the enemy, which is a concern.\n\nAlternatively, go for (9,2), then (6,1), then (5,4), then (3,2), and finally (0,0).\n\nThat seems like a logical sequence, maximizing distance from the enemy.\n\nSo, first, go right to (6,2), then\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nI decide to move RIGHT to (6,"

The closest apple would be (5,4) or (4,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can move left to (5,2), then up to (5,4) for the apple.\n\nBut, considering the positions, moving to (9,2) and then up to (5,4) would require moving left four steps from (9,2) to (5,2), then up two steps to (5,4).\n\nThat seems a bit long, and I might be exposed to the enemy during that movement.\n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,2), I can consider moving down to (9,0), but there's no apple there, and it's closer to the enemy.\n\nI think the best approach is to go for the closest apple first, which is (9,2), then consider moving to (5,4), and finally to (0,0).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (9,2) first, then move up to (9,4), but there's no apple there. So, maybe move left to (5,4).\n\nWait, (5,4) is at column 5, row 4.\n\nFrom (9,2), moving left to (5,2), then up to (5,4).\n\nThat's four steps left and two steps up.\n\nBut I need to make sure the enemy isn't in that path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (5,4) directly from (6,2).\n\nFrom (6,2), moving up to (6,4), then left to (5,4).\n\nThat's two steps up and one step left.\n\nThis seems shorter and avoids the enemy, which is at (0,2) and (0,3).\n\nAfter eating (5,4), I can then move down to (5,0), but there's an apple at (4,0), so maybe left to (4,4), then down to (4,0).\n\nThen, finally, move left to (0,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy during these movements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps going for (4,0) after (5,4) isn't the best plan, as it's still central, and the enemy might be moving towards this area.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,0) is at column 4, row 0.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving down to (5,0), then left to (4,0).\n\nBut moving down from (5,4) to (5,0) is four steps down.\n\nThat might take too many turns, and the enemy could be moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,4), I can consider moving left to (1,4), then down to (1,0), then left to (0,0).\n\nBut that seems too far.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for (9,2), then (5,4), then (0,0).\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. From (6,2), move right to (9,2): three steps right.\n\n2. Eat the apple at (9,2), grow longer.\n\n3. From (9,2), move left to (5,2): four steps left.\n\n4. Then, move up to (5,4): two steps up.\n\n5. Eat the apple at (5,4), grow longer.\n\n6. From (5,4), move down to (5,0): four steps down.\n\n7. Then, move left to (0,0): five steps left.\n\n8. Eat the apple at (0,0).\n\nThis seems a bit too long, and I might be exposed to the enemy during these movements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (3,2) first, since it's also three steps left, and then consider moving to (5,4).\n\nBut (3,2) is closer to the enemy, which is at (0,2) and (0,3).\n\nIf I go left to (3,2), I might run into the enemy if it's moving right.\n\nGiven that, going for (9,2) seems safer.\n\nWait, let's consider the positions again.\n\nMy snake is at (6,2).\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,2), body at (0,3).\n\nApples are at (0,0), (3,2), (9,2), (5,4), (4,0).\n\nI need to prioritize apples that are farther from the enemy and easier to reach.\n\nGiven that, (9,2) is the best choice.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n- Move right to (9,2).\n\n- Eat the apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, move left to (5,2).\n\n- Move up to (5,4).\n\n- Eat the apple at (5,4).\n\n- Then, move down to (5,0).\n\n- Move left to (4,0).\n\n- Eat the apple at (4,0).\n\n- Finally, move left to (0,0).\n\n- Eat the apple at (0,0).\n\nBut this seems too long, and I might be vulnerable to the enemy during these movements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (5,4) first, as it's central and can allow me to reach other apples more easily.\n\nFrom (6,2), moving up to (6,4), then left to (5,4).\n\nThat's two steps up and one step left.\n\nThen, from (5,4), I can move down to (5,0), then left to (4,0), then to (0,0).\n\nThis seems more efficient.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards (5,4).\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (0,2), it might be moving down or right.\n\nI need to assume the worst and plan accordingly.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to go for (9,2), the farthest apple from the enemy, to minimize the chance of collision.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll move right to (9,2).\n\n**Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The apple at (9,2) is the farthest from the enemy, reducing the risk of collision.\n\n- It's equally distant as (3,2), but (9,2"
