Being mindful of Snake #2's position, it seems that it might head for the apple at (0, 9) or (5, 8) given its current position. At the moment there are no immediate obstacles blocking my way.\n\nFor the next move, depending on the movement direction of Snake #2, I can adjust and react accordingly: If it does not pose any immediate threat, I can continue my path towards the apple at (6, 2). If it seems to be heading towards me, I can first go down to (6, 1) and then move right to eat the apple at (9, 2), assuming it's not yet taken.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
