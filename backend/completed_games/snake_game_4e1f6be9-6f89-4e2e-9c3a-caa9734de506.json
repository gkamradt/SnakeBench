            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,0). There are apples at (6,3), (5,7), (8,7), (9,9), and (1,5). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (1,0), which is on the bottom row, second from the left. There's an apple at (1,5), which is directly above me, since moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nBut I also need to consider the other apples and the enemy snake. The enemy is at (3,8), which is towards the top-right area. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet me think about a strategy. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible and have more points than the enemy snake by the end of the game.\n\nOne approach could be to go for the closest apple first to minimize the risk and maximize my score quickly. The apple at (1,5) is directly above me, so that seems like the easiest to reach.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the other apples and plan a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples without getting into a trap.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position:\n\n- (6,3): That's 5 units right and 3 units up, so a total of 8 units away.\n\n- (5,7): 4 units right and 7 units up, total 11 units.\n\n- (8,7): 7 units right and 7 units up, total 14 units.\n\n- (9,9): 8 units right and 9 units up, total 17 units.\n\n- (1,5): 0 units right and 5 units up, total 5 units.\n\nSo, the apple at (1,5) is the closest. After picking that one, I can reassess which one to go for next.\n\nBut I should also consider whether there are any paths that allow me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's see: from (1,5), I could potentially go for (5,7), which is 4 units right and 2 units up.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,5), I could go left to (0,5), but there aren't any apples that way.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,3) is somewhat diagonally up and to the right. Maybe I can plan a path that allows me to pick up (1,5) and then head towards (6,3).\n\nBut I also need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. It's currently at (3,8), and I don't know its direction or length.\n\nAssuming it's just the head for now, I should avoid that position.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows by eating apples, I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nSo, perhaps the best first move is to go up towards the apple at (1,5).\n\nLet me think about potential obstacles.\n\nFrom (1,0) to (1,5), that's a straight path up. Are there any snakes or walls in the way? According to the board state, it looks clear.\n\nRow 0: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nSo, from (1,0), moving up to (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) where the apple is.\n\nLooks clear. No snakes or walls in the way.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,5), I'll have grown longer. So, I need to make sure that continuing from there doesn't lead me into my own tail.\n\nLet me think about where to go next after (1,5).\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,3). That would require moving right to (2,5), then (3,5), etc., up to (6,5), then down to (6,4), (6,3).\n\nBut that seems a bit far, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nOption 2: Go for (5,7). From (1,5), move right to (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), then up to (5,6), (5,7).\n\nThat's a distance of 4 right and 2 up, total 6 moves.\n\nComparing to going for (6,3), which is 5 right and 2 down, total 7 moves.\n\nSo, (5,7) is closer.\n\nBut looking at the board, there's an apple at (8,7), which is further to the right.\n\nMaybe I can aim for (5,7), then (8,7), picking up two apples in one path.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (8,7) is 3 units right.\n\nSo, total from (1,5) to (5,7) is 4 right and 2 up, then 3 right to (8,7).\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for (9,9), which is 1 right and 2 up from (8,7).\n\nBut that's getting into the top-right corner, where the enemy snake is also located.\n\nI need to be careful not to collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (6,3), which is somewhat in the middle.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize that one after (1,5).\n\nWait, but (6,3) is somewhat out of the way from (1,5). Going to (5,7) seems more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\nFrom (1,5):\n\n- To (5,7): 4 right, 2 up.\n\n- To (6,3): 5 right, 2 down.\n\n- To (8,7): 7 right, 2 up.\n\n- To (9,9): 8 right, 4 up.\n\n- To (1,5): already there.\n\nSo, (5,7) is the closest next apple after (1,5).\n\nI think I should aim for (5,7) after picking up (1,5).\n\nBut first things first, I need to get to (1,5).\n\nFrom (1,0) to (1,5), that's 5 moves up.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nBut since I'm moving straight up, and there are no turns, my tail should just follow behind me, so I shouldn't run into it.\n\nAlright, so my immediate move is to go up.\n\nBut let's confirm there are no obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nFrom (1,0), moving up to (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).\n\nAll these positions are empty, so it's safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,5), I'll grow longer, but since I'm moving straight up, my tail will just follow, and I won't run into it.\n\nSo, my first move is to go up.\n\nThen, next turn, I'll continue going up to (1,6), but wait, there's no apple there.\n\nWait, actually, row 5 is y=5, and row 6 is y=6, up to row 9 which is y=9.\n\nBut looking back, the apple at (1,5) is at row 5, which is y=5.\n\nAbove that is y=6, then y=7, etc.\n\nBut from (1,5), to get to (5,7), I need to move right to (2,5), then (3,5), etc., up to (5,5), then up to (5,6), (5,7).\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,5), I"

If not, I will move towards the apple at (9, 9) instead.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (8, 7), I will move right (direction: RIGHT) if it's safe to do so, or towards the apple at (9, 9) if it's not possible to reach the apple at (6, 3).\n\nNext move: UP (to reach the apple at (8, 7))"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to decide my next move. Let's see the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,1). Wait, in the board state, it shows my position at (1,0), but according to the initial information, it's at (1,1). Hmm, maybe there's a confusion between row and column indices. Let's clarify that.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- The rows are labeled from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top.\n\n- The columns are labeled from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (1,1) would be column 1, row 1, which is the second column from the left and the second row from the bottom.\n\nBut in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumn 1: positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with the notation. In programming, usually, coordinates are (row, column), with (0,0) being the top-left. But in this description, it says (0,0) is bottom-left, which is more like traditional Cartesian coordinates.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- (0,0): bottom-left\n\n- (9,9): top-right\n\n- Increasing y is moving up\n\n- Increasing x is moving right\n\nGiven that, my position is (1,1), which is one unit to the right and one unit up from the bottom-left corner.\n\nNow, the apples are at:\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,7)\n\n- (8,7)\n\n- (9,9)\n\n- (1,5)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,9), with no body parts listed, so likely just the head.\n\nOkay, I need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions relative to my current location.\n\nI'm at (1,1).\n\nApples:\n\n- (6,3): 5 right, 2 up\n\n- (5,7): 4 right, 6 up\n\n- (8,7): 7 right, 6 up\n\n- (9,9): 8 right, 8 up\n\n- (1,5): 0 right, 4 up\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be (1,5), directly above me.\n\nBut I should think about a longer-term strategy. Maybe plan a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nAlso, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or my own body as I grow.\n\nLet me consider the positions step by step.\n\nFirst, moving towards (1,5):\n\nFrom (1,1), I can move up 4 times to reach (1,5). That seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,5), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that continuing from there doesn't lead me into my own tail.\n\nThen, from (1,5), what's the next best apple to go for?\n\nLooking at the distances from (1,5):\n\n- (6,3): 5 right, 2 down\n\n- (5,7): 4 right, 2 up\n\n- (8,7): 7 right, 2 up\n\n- (9,9): 8 right, 4 up\n\n- (1,5): already there\n\nSo, (5,7) is 4 right and 2 up, which seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, (6,3) is 5 right and 2 down.\n\nI should consider which path is safer and shorter.\n\nLet me map out a path:\n\n1. From (1,1), move up to (1,2)\n\n2. Then up to (1,3)\n\n3. Then up to (1,4)\n\n4. Then up to (1,5) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, after eating the apple, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nAssuming I grow by one unit, my tail will be at (1,1), and my head at (1,5).\n\nSo, if I move right to (2,5), my tail will move to (1,2).\n\nThen to (3,5), tail moves to (1,3), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me plan the path to (5,7):\n\nFrom (1,5):\n\n- Right to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Right to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Up to (5,6)\n\n- Up to (5,7) to eat the apple.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating (5,7), I'll grow again, so I need to plan the next move.\n\nLooking at the next apple, (8,7):\n\nFrom (5,7), move right to (6,7), then (7,7), then (8,7).\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nAfter that, perhaps go for (9,9): from (8,7), move right to (9,7), then up to (9,8), then up to (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, go for (6,3): from (8,7), down to (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), then left to (7,3), (6,3).\n\nBut that seems longer.\n\nWait, maybe from (8,7), go down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6), which doesn't lead me to any apple.\n\nThat's not efficient.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for (9,9) after (8,7).\n\nFrom (8,7), right to (9,7), then up to (9,8), up to (9,9).\n\nThat's only 3 moves.\n\nThen, if possible, go for (6,3): from (9,9), left to (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), down to (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n\nThat's a long path; maybe not the best.\n\nAlternatively, after (9,9), go for (8,7), but I already planned to go from (8,7) to (9,9).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to prioritize the apples based on their positions.\n\nApples at:\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (5,7)\n\n- (8,7)\n\n- (9,9)\n\n- (6,3)\n\nI can try to collect them in that order: (1,5) -> (5,7) -> (8,7) -> (9,9) -> (6,3).\n\nThat seems logical, moving right and up mostly.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,9), and I don't know its direction or length.\n\nI should try to avoid that area if possible.\n\nFrom (9,9), moving down to (6,3) would take me through the enemy's possible territory.\n\nAlternatively, after (9,9), maybe go for (8,7), then (5,7), then (6,3), and finally (1,5). But I already ate (1,5) first.\n\nWait, maybe I should plan a different order.\n\nLet me consider the distances between apples:\n\n- (1,5) to (5,7): 4 right, 2 up \u2192 6 moves\n\n- (5,7) to (8,7): 3 right, 0 up \u2192 3 moves\n\n- (8,7) to (9,9): 1 right, 2 up \u2192 3 moves\n\n- (9,9) to (6,3): 3 left, 6 down \u2192 9 moves\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 21 moves\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- (1,5) to (6,3): 5 right, 2 down \u2192 7 moves\n\n- (6,3) to (5,7): 1 left, 4 up \u2192 5 moves\n\n- (5,7) to (8,7): 3 right, 0 up \u2192 3 moves\n\n- (8,7) to (9,9): 1 right, 2 up \u2192 3 moves\n\nTotal: 7 + 5 + 3 + 3 = 18 moves\n\nWait, this seems more efficient.\n\nBut I need to consider whether moving from (1,5) to (6,3) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, from (1,5), right to (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), then down to (6,4), (6,3).\n\nThat seems doable.\n\nThen from (6,3), up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9).\n\nWait, that's a longer path.\n\nWait, no, from (6,3)"
