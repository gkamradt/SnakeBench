However, it doesn't seem to lead to any immediate scoring or beneficial moves.\n  \n4. **RIGHT (to (7, 3))**: \n   - This option also leads to an empty cell but keeps me away from where I want to go towards (4, 7) and might create a less advantageous position later.\n\nThe safest and most strategic move appears to be **UP** to (6, 4), which opens up the board for possible subsequent moves towards the apples while still remaining in a dynamic position to avoid the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter moving UP to (6, 4), my priority will be to stay flexible.

I remain at a safer distance while providing future routes to explore towards the upper portion of the board.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves:\nAs my goal is to maintain flexibility and not head into any danger, moving RIGHT keeps me in the central part of the board and away from clustered enemy snakes. This direction allows me to evaluate further potential moves toward apples.\n\n**Considering the above analysis, the best option is to move RIGHT to (7, 5).**\n\nNext Move: RIGHT"

Still valuable since it opens options on your next turn.\n4. **RIGHT (to (8, 7))**: Also an open space and will keep me centered on the right side of the board.\n\n### Review of Apples:\n- The nearest apples are at (1, 0), (0, 8), (4, 7), and (9, 7). The closest apple is at (4, 7), which is not directly reachable from your current position without a few moves.\n\n### Move Strategy:\nTo remain flexible and avoid the enemy snake while maximizing opportunities to move towards apples, the best option appears to be RIGHT to (8, 7). \n\nWhile moving LEFT would give you more lateral space, I'm reiterating that RIGHT provides an open area, helping to keep my options open in case more enemies appear.\n\nIn summary, I will focus on moving towards the neighboring area that provides the best potential for future moves toward apples while keeping distance from enemy snakes. \n\nNext Move: RIGHT"

While the apple at (4, 7) is further down the board, there are other apples, but since you are currently positioned so close (1 unit) to an apple at (9, 7), moving there would be ideal.\n\n### Strategic Consideration\nSince you\u2019re so close to an apple, the best strategy is to prioritize collecting it immediately.
