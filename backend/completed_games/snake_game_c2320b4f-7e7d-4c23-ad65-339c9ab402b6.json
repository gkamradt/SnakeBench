Therefore, I can focus on collecting the apples in a strategic order.\n\nThe apple at (5, 1) is the closest, but moving towards it will put me in a position where I have fewer options for subsequent moves without running into my own tail. Instead, I should aim for the apple at (6, 7), which will allow me to continue moving towards other apples without backtracking.\n\nTo get to the apple at (6, 7), I need to move right (increasing x) and then up (increasing y). This will also position me to easily move towards the apple at (8, 3) after that without having to cross my own path or the path I plan to take.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the right, towards the apple at (6, 7).\n\nNext move: RIGHT.\n\nFor the next turn, I will move up to collect the apple at (6, 7), and then I will need to decide whether to continue towards (8, 3) or to collect the apple at (1, 2) first, considering the positions of the other snakes and the apples on the board at that time."
