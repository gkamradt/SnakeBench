Moving upward maintains a safe trajectory towards the target apples while avoiding immediate danger.\n\n4. **Future Turns:** Continuing north in the subsequent turn, then potentially planning a left turn depending on the updated position of Snake #2 and any newly spawned apples.

Given this snake's position, it appears not to pose an immediate threat from the east.\n\nStrategy Considerations:\n\n1. **Proceeding Northwards:** The move should take us closer to the apples located at (6, 4) and (5, 4), which are in the fourth row. These apples provide the nearest food sources and an opportunity to grow the snake without interfering with Snake #2.\n\n2. **Avoiding Collision:** Your current position at (9, 1) alongside the right edge of the board, makes the RIGHT move fatal due to a wall collision. As a result, UP is the safe direction that also aligns with the plan to access the apples at (6, 4) and (5, 4).\n\n3. **Navigating Enemy Snake and Walls:** As Snake #2 is currently at (7, 7) at the top-middle of the board, your foremost plan should ensure a safe buffer space while maintaining direction toward the strategically beneficial targets\u2014the cluster of apples on the left side of the row 4.\n\n4. **Future Strategy:** Since Snake #2 could potentially be heading towards the top side apples at (8, 7) and (5, 7) next time, monitoring its movement and adjusting your strategy to e.g., shifting left, could become necessary as you draw closer to the apples on the fifth row.\n\nConsidering these points, your next practical move would be:\n\n**Next move: UP**\n\nThis decision explicitly avoids walls, aids in approaching vital resources, and keeps a safe distance from potential enemy paths.
