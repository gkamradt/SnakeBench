The board shows me at (1, 1), not (2, 1) as I previously thought.\n- This changes my immediate strategy slightly.\n\nApple Analysis:\n- Closest apples: \n  1. (1, 3) - most immediate target\n  2. (0, 4) - another close option\n  3. (1, 0) - another potential target\n\nSnake Positioning:\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (8, 9) with body at (8, 8)\n- Minimal immediate threat to my movement\n\nStrategic Considerations:\n- I want to approach the (1, 3) apple systematically\n- Current position at (1, 1) means I need to move UP to reach the apple\n- Clear path to the apple with no obstacles\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- No immediate collision risks\n- Board movement is safe\n- Direct path to target apple\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\n- Move towards the (1, 3) apple\n- Maintain awareness of board state\n- Prepare for potential future apple collection\n\nDecision Rationale:\nMoving UP will bring me directly closer to the (1, 3) apple and improve my board position.\n\nNext move: UP"
