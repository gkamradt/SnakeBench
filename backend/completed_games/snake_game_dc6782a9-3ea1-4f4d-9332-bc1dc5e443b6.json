I will also keep an eye out for any new apples that might appear on the board.\n\nMy next move is: UP."

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake. The board is 10x10, and my snake is at (2,5). The apples are at (5,4), (7,8), (9,0), (7,5), (8,3). The enemy snake is at (8,8) with an empty body, so it's just the head. \n\nFirst, I should check possible directions. From (2,5), possible moves are UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), or RIGHT to (3,5). I need to avoid walls, other snakes, and myself. Since my snake just started (since the last move direction was None), maybe it's only the head right now. So moving in any direction is possible as long as it's safe.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,4) and (7,5). (5,4) is to the right and down a bit. From (2,5), moving right would get me closer to (5,4). But moving right to (3,5) is safe? Let's check the board state. The board shows at (5,4) there's an apple (A), and (7,5) is another A. \n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (8,8). So that's not near me. So the main threats are walls and maybe other apples. Wait, but the enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since I don't know their next move, maybe I should focus on my own path.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), that's safe. Then from there, I can continue towards (5,4). Alternatively, going UP to (2,6) might not lead me towards any apples immediately. DOWN to (2,4) would take me closer to (5,4) as well. Let me think: (2,5) to (3,5) is right. Then next move could be right again to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go DOWN to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's also three moves. Hmm. Which path is safer?\n\nWait, moving right first might be better because going down would take me to (2,4), which is one step closer to the apple. But maybe the path is clear. Let me check the board again. The board shows that at (5,4) there's an apple. The snake's current position is (2,5). So moving right to (3,5) is safe. Are there any obstacles in that path? The board state shows that row 5 (y=5) has my snake at (2,5), and then (7,5) is an apple. So from (2,5) to (3,5) is empty. Then (4,5) is empty, (5,5) is empty, etc. So moving right seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (2,4) would take me to a position where the next move could be right towards the apple. But (2,4) is also safe. Let me check if there's any other apples closer. The apple at (7,5) is further right. The apple at (8,3) is even further. The apple at (9,0) is far away. The apple at (7,8) is up and right. So the closest apples are (5,4) and (7,5). \n\nIf I go right now, I can start heading towards (5,4). Alternatively, maybe going up towards (7,8) but that's a longer path. So probably the best bet is to go for the closest apple. \n\nWait, but moving right from (2,5) to (3,5) is safe. Then next move right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving down first to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's three moves as well. Hmm. So either direction could work. \n\nBut maybe moving right first is better because it's a straight path. Also, if I go down, I might be moving away from other apples. Wait, but (7,5) is another apple. If I go right, I can eventually go up towards (7,5) after getting (5,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's any immediate danger. The enemy snake is at (8,8), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So the main thing is to avoid walls and self-collision. Since my snake is just starting, there's no body to collide with. So any direction is safe as long as it's within the board. \n\nSo possible moves: UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5). All these are within the board. So which direction leads to the nearest apple? The apple at (5,4) is to the right and down. So moving right or down would get me closer. \n\nIf I move right to (3,5), then next move could be right again to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving down to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then right to (5,4). Same number of steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first would be better because (2,4) is closer to (5,4) in the y-coordinate. Wait, (5,4) is at x=5, y=4. So from (2,5), moving down to (2,4) gets me to y=4, same as the apple. Then moving right three times would get me to (5,4). So that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving right three times to (5,5), then down to (5,4). That's four moves. So moving down first might be more efficient. \n\nSo maybe moving down to (2,4) is better. But wait, moving down from (2,5) to (2,4) is safe. Then next move right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving right first: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), then down to (5,4). That's four moves. So moving down first is better. \n\nBut wait, the apple is at (5,4). So if I go down to (2,4), then I can move right three times to reach (5,4). Each right move increases x by 1. So from (2,4) to (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). That's three moves. So total of four moves (including the initial down). \n\nAlternatively, moving right three times to (5,5), then down to (5,4). That's four moves. So same number. \n\nBut maybe the path via down is better because once I reach (5,4), I can then go for the next apple. But perhaps there's another consideration. Are there any other apples that could be collected along the way? For example, if I go right towards (7,5), but that's further. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,5) is also a target. But it's further away. So perhaps the best is to go for the closest apple first. \n\nSo the initial move could be either right or down. Let's check the board again. The apple at (5,4) is in column 5, row 4. My current position is (2,5). So moving down to (2,4) would get me to the same row as the apple. Then moving right three times. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (3,5), then right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's four moves. \n\nHmm. So both paths take the same number of steps. So which is safer? \n\nIf I move down first, then I'm in row 4. Are there any obstacles there? The board shows at (5,4) there's an apple, and (4,4) is empty. So moving down to (2,4) is safe. Then moving right. \n\nAlternatively, moving right first, (3,5) is safe. Then (4,5) is safe. Then (4,4) is safe. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,8). They might be moving towards the apple at (7,8) which is nearby. But that's not affecting me right now. \n\nSo perhaps either direction is okay. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a more straightforward path. Or maybe moving down to get into the same row as the apple. \n\nWait, but moving down would take me to (2,4). Then moving right three times. But what if there's another apple that appears in the meantime? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first allows me to have more flexibility. For example, after moving right to (3,5), I can then decide to go down or right again. \n\nBut the main goal is to get to the apple as quickly as possible. So whichever path is shorter. Both paths take the same number of steps. So maybe it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a direction that can lead to other apples as well. For example, after getting (5,4), I can go up to (5,5) and then right towards (7,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving down first might be better because it's a straight line. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about possible dangers. If I move left to (1,5), that's possible, but there's no apple in that direction. So that's not useful. Moving up to (2,6) takes me away from the closest apples. So that's not good. So the best options are right or down. \n\nSince both right and down are valid and lead to the apple in the same number of steps, maybe I should choose the direction that avoids potential future collisions. But since there's no body yet, maybe it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a more direct path. Let's see: moving right three times to (5,5), then down to (5,4). That's four moves. But if I move down first, then right three times, that's four moves as well. \n\nWait, no. If I move down first (1 move), then right three times (3 moves), total 4 moves. If I move right three times (3 moves), then down (1 move), total 4 moves. So same. \n\nBut in the first case, after moving down, I'm in the same row as the apple. So maybe that's better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path via down is better because once I'm in the same row, I can go straight right. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just pick one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again. The apples are at (5,4), (7,8), (9,0), (7,5), (8,3). The closest ones are (5,4) and (7,5). (7,5) is further right. So (5,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best move is to start heading towards (5,4). So either right or down. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a more general direction towards multiple apples. \n\nWait, if I move right to (3,5), then next move could be right again to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's three moves. Wait, no: initial move right (1), then right (2), then down (3), then right (4). So four moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first (1), then right three times (4). So same. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should just choose right. \n\nWait, but the apple at (5,4) is at y=4, so moving down from (2,5) to (2,4) gets me to the same y-coordinate. Then moving right three times. \n\nAlternatively, moving right three times to (5,5), then down to (5,4). \n\nEither way, same steps. \n\nBut maybe moving down first is better because once I'm at (2,4), I can move right towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards me. But the enemy is at (8,8), which is far away. \n\nSo perhaps either direction is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a more open path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first is better because it's a straight line. \n\nI think I'll go with moving right first. So the first move is RIGHT to (3,5). Then next moves can be right again. \n\nBut wait, the current position is (2,5). Moving right to (3,5) is safe. Then next move right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should just pick the direction that leads me towards the apple. Since the apple is to the right and down, moving right or down. \n\nAlternatively, the direction that gets me closer in Manhattan distance. The Manhattan distance from (2,5) to (5,4) is (5-2) + (5-4) = 3 +1=4. Moving right reduces the x distance by 1, so Manhattan distance becomes 2 +1=3. Moving down reduces the y distance by 1, so Manhattan distance becomes 3 +0=3. So both moves reduce the distance equally. \n\nSo either direction is equally good. \n\nIn that case, maybe I should choose the direction that allows for more flexibility. For example, moving right might keep me in a higher y-coordinate, which could be useful for accessing other apples later. \n\nAlternatively, moving down might be better because once I'm at y=4, I can move right towards the apple. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there are any other apples that are reachable. For example, after getting (5,4), the next apple could be (7,5). So from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then right to (7,5). \n\nBut that's after collecting the first apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better. \n\nI think I'll go with moving RIGHT to (3,5) as the first step. Then next move right again. \n\nBut wait, the snake's body will grow when it eats an apple. So after eating the apple, the body will extend. But since the snake is just starting, the body is only the head. So after eating the first apple, the body will be two segments. So I need to make sure that when I move, I don't run into my own body. \n\nBut right now, the body is just the head. So moving right is safe. \n\nSo the decision is between RIGHT and DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, maybe I'll choose RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the apple at (5,4) is at x=5, y=4. So moving right from (2,5) to (3,5) is moving in the x direction, which is towards the apple's x-coordinate. Moving down to (2,4) is moving towards the apple's y-coordinate. \n\nBut both are needed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a more direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. \n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should just pick one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,5) is also a target. If I move right, I can eventually reach (7,5) after (5,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nI think I'll go with moving RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (5,4). So the next move is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,4) by moving right to approach it efficiently while keeping future paths open for other apples. \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

So moving right or down would get me closer. \n\nIf I move right to (3,5), then next move could be right again to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving down to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then right to (5,4). Same number of steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first would be better because (2,4) is closer to (5,4) in the y-coordinate. Wait, (5,4) is at x=5, y=4. So from (2,5), moving down to (2,4) gets me to y=4, same as the apple. Then moving right three times would get me to (5,4). So that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving right three times to (5,5), then down to (5,4). That's four moves. So moving down first might be more efficient. \n\nSo maybe moving down to (2,4) is better. But wait, moving down from (2,5) to (2,4) is safe. Then next move right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving right first: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), then down to (5,4). That's four moves. So moving down first is better. \n\nBut wait, the apple is at (5,4). So if I go down to (2,4), then I can move right three times to reach (5,4). Each right move increases x by 1. So from (2,4) to (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). That's three moves. So total of four moves (including the initial down). \n\nAlternatively, moving right three times to (5,5), then down to (5,4). That's four moves. So same number. \n\nBut maybe the path via down is better because once I reach (5,4), I can then go for the next apple. But perhaps there's another consideration. Are there any other apples that could be collected along the way? For example, if I go right towards (7,5), but that's further. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,5) is also a target. But it's further away. So perhaps the best is to go for the closest apple first. \n\nSo the initial move could be either right or down. Let's check the board again. The apple at (5,4) is in column 5, row 4. My current position is (2,5). So moving down to (2,4) would get me to the same row as the apple. Then moving right three times. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (3,5), then right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's four moves. \n\nHmm. So both paths take the same number of steps. So which is safer? \n\nIf I move down first, then I'm in row 4. Are there any obstacles there? The board shows at (5,4) there's an apple, and (4,4) is empty. So moving down to (2,4) is safe. Then moving right. \n\nAlternatively, moving right first, (3,5) is safe. Then (4,5) is safe. Then (4,4) is safe. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,8). They might be moving towards the apple at (7,8) which is nearby. But that's not affecting me right now. \n\nSo perhaps either direction is okay. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a more straightforward path. Or maybe moving down to get into the same row as the apple. \n\nWait, but moving down would take me to (2,4). Then moving right three times. But what if there's another apple that appears in the meantime? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first allows me to have more flexibility. For example, after moving right to (3,5), I can then decide to go down or right again. \n\nBut the main goal is to get to the apple as quickly as possible. So whichever path is shorter. Both paths take the same number of steps. So maybe it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a direction that can lead to other apples as well. For example, after getting (5,4), I can go up to (5,5) and then right towards (7,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving down first might be better because it's a straight line. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about possible dangers. If I move left to (1,5), that's possible, but there's no apple in that direction. So that's not useful. Moving up to (2,6) takes me away from the closest apples. So that's not good. So the best options are right or down. \n\nSince both right and down are valid and lead to the apple in the same number of steps, maybe I should choose the direction that avoids potential future collisions. But since there's no body yet, maybe it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a more direct path. Let's see: moving right three times to (5,5), then down to (5,4). That's four moves. But if I move down first, then right three times, that's four moves as well. \n\nWait, no. If I move down first (1 move), then right three times (3 moves), total 4 moves. If I move right three times (3 moves), then down (1 move), total 4 moves. So same. \n\nBut in the first case, after moving down, I'm in the same row as the apple. So maybe that's better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path via down is better because once I'm in the same row, I can go straight right. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just pick one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. Let's check the apples again. The apples are at (5,4), (7,8), (9,0), (7,5), (8,3). The closest ones are (5,4) and (7,5). (7,5) is further right. So (5,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best move is to start heading towards (5,4). So either right or down. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a more general direction towards multiple apples. \n\nWait, if I move right to (3,5), then next move could be right again to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). That's three moves. Wait, no: initial move right (1), then right (2), then down (3), then right (4). So four moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first (1), then right three times (4). So same. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should just choose right. \n\nWait, but the apple at (5,4) is at y=4, so moving down from (2,5) to (2,4) gets me to the same y-coordinate. Then moving right three times. \n\nAlternatively, moving right three times to (5,5), then down to (5,4). \n\nEither way, same steps. \n\nBut maybe moving down first is better because once I'm at (2,4), I can move right towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards me. But the enemy is at (8,8), which is far away. \n\nSo perhaps either direction is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a more open path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first is better because it's a straight line. \n\nI think I'll go with moving right first. So the first move is RIGHT to (3,5). Then next moves can be right again. \n\nBut wait, the current position is (2,5). Moving right to (3,5) is safe. Then next move right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then right to (5,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should just pick the direction that leads me towards the apple. Since the apple is to the right and down, moving right or down. \n\nAlternatively, the direction that gets me closer in Manhattan distance. The Manhattan distance from (2,5) to (5,4) is (5-2) + (5-4) = 3 +1=4. Moving right reduces the x distance by 1, so Manhattan distance becomes 2 +1=3. Moving down reduces the y distance by 1, so Manhattan distance becomes 3 +0=3. So both moves reduce the distance equally. \n\nSo either direction is equally good. \n\nIn that case, maybe I should choose the direction that allows for more flexibility. For example, moving right might keep me in a higher y-coordinate, which could be useful for accessing other apples later. \n\nAlternatively, moving down might be better because once I'm at y=4, I can move right towards the apple. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there are any other apples that are reachable. For example, after getting (5,4), the next apple could be (7,5). So from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then right to (7,5). \n\nBut that's after collecting the first apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better. \n\nI think I'll go with moving RIGHT to (3,5) as the first step. Then next move right again. \n\nBut wait, the snake's body will grow when it eats an apple. So after eating the apple, the body will extend. But since the snake is just starting, the body is only the head. So after eating the first apple, the body will be two segments. So I need to make sure that when I move, I don't run into my own body. \n\nBut right now, the body is just the head. So moving right is safe. \n\nSo the decision is between RIGHT and DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, maybe I'll choose RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the apple at (5,4) is at x=5, y=4. So moving right from (2,5) to (3,5) is moving in the x direction, which is towards the apple's x-coordinate. Moving down to (2,4) is moving towards the apple's y-coordinate. \n\nBut both are needed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right first is better because it's a more direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. \n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should just pick one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,5) is also a target. If I move right, I can eventually reach (7,5) after (5,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nI think I'll go with moving RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (5,4). So the next move is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,4) by moving right to approach it efficiently while keeping future paths open for other apples. \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

I will also keep an eye out for any new apples that might appear on the board.\n\nMy next move is: UP."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (3,5) after moving right from (2,5) in the last turn. The apples are still at (5,4), (7,8), (9,0), (7,5), (8,3). The enemy snake #1 is at (8,9) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5) are UP to (3,6), DOWN to (3,4), LEFT to (2,5), or RIGHT to (4,5). I need to avoid walls, other snakes, and my own body. Since my snake just started, there's no body yet except the head, so all directions except LEFT (which would backtrack to (2,5)) are safe. Wait, backtracking isn't an issue here because there's no body yet. Wait, the last move was RIGHT to (3,5), so the previous position was (2,5). If I move LEFT back to (2,5), that's technically possible since there's no body there yet. But in Snake games, moving back into your own previous position is allowed unless the body has grown. Since I haven't eaten an apple yet, my body is still just the head. So moving LEFT to (2,5) is safe. However, that would be moving away from the apple at (5,4). So the viable options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT, or LEFT, but LEFT is not productive.\n\nThe closest apple is still (5,4). From (3,5), moving RIGHT to (4,5) gets closer. Then from there, moving RIGHT again to (5,5) and then DOWN to (5,4). Alternatively, moving DOWN from (3,5) to (3,4) would align me with the apple's y-coordinate, then moving RIGHT twice to (5,4). Both paths take three moves. \n\nConsidering efficiency, moving RIGHT continues the direct path towards the apple. Moving DOWN might be slightly faster as it aligns the y-coordinate immediately. Let's calculate Manhattan distance: from (3,5) to (5,4) is 2 (x) + 1 (y) = 3. Moving RIGHT reduces x distance by 1 (distance becomes 1+1=2). Moving DOWN reduces y distance by 1 (distance becomes 2+0=2). Both are equally good. \n\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (4,5) keeps the path open for future moves towards other apples like (7,5). Moving DOWN to (3,4) might limit options if other apples are higher up. Also, the enemy snake at (8,9) is far away, so no immediate threat. \n\nTherefore, continuing RIGHT towards (5,4) is optimal. Next move: RIGHT to (4,5).\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving RIGHT to efficiently reach the apple at (5,4) while maintaining a path towards other apples like (7,5). \n\nNext move: RIGHT"
