Moving left wouldn\u2019t help if Snake #2 starts moving down and staying in the corner is dangerous.\n   - Moving right (away from Snake #2) gives space for future moves if needed but an apple isn't on the right side.\n\n### Strategy for Next Move:\n1. **Proactive Move**: Moving right towards incoming apples/or apple,\n2. **Avoid Collision**: Make sure to move away from Snake #2. Currently, it\u2019s diagonally upwards, so move left is a safer option.\n\n### Next Move:\nEven though horisontally moving closer to, avoid immediate danger.
