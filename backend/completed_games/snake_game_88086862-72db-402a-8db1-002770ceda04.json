The nearest apple is at (5,1), but as we previously deduced, going for this apple will put me in a tight spot as it is near the walls and there is a higher chance of me running into enemy Snake #2. Thus, I shall continue my plan to aim for the apple at (2,5). \n\nTo get this apple, I need to move LEFT. However, I need to be careful of the enemy snake. I will try to distance myself from Snake #2 by maintaining a roughly 3-4 point gap between us.\n\nIn terms of future strategy, after reaching the apple at (2,5), I will aim for the top right apples. Also, if at any time it seems that Snake #2 is coming towards me, I have to switch directions quickly to avoid it. The wall boundaries will need to be avoided, but they can also be used to trap the enemy snake in a tight spot. \n\nMy next move: LEFT."

The nearest apple is at (5,1), but as we previously deduced, going for this apple will put me in a tight spot as it is near the walls and there is a higher chance of me running into enemy Snake #2. Thus, I shall continue my plan to aim for the apple at (2,5). \n\nTo get this apple, I need to move LEFT. However, I need to be careful of the enemy snake. I will try to distance myself from Snake #2 by maintaining a roughly 3-4 point gap between us.\n\nIn terms of future strategy, after reaching the apple at (2,5), I will aim for the top right apples. Also, if at any time it seems that Snake #2 is coming towards me, I have to switch directions quickly to avoid it. The wall boundaries will need to be avoided, but they can also be used to trap the enemy snake in a tight spot. \n\nMy next move: LEFT."
