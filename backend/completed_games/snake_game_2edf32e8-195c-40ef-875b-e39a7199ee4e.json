I should try to move towards it to collect the point.\n\nHowever, I also see that Snake #2 is at (4, 6) and it's heading in the same direction as me. To avoid a collision, I should try to move around it.\n\nConsidering the available options, I think I'll move RIGHT to try to get closer to the apple at (4, 4) while avoiding Snake #2.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to position myself between Snake #2 and the apple at (4, 4) to limit its movement options and increase my chances of collecting the apple.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
