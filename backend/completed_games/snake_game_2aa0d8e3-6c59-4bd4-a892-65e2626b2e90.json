However, it doesn't bring me closer to any food just yet.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (6, 6) does allow me to keep options open towards other movements down the line but does not strategically support immediate gain from the remaining apples.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n1. I want to prioritize positioning that keeps me closer to potential apple captures, while also being mindful of staying away from the enemy snake.\n2. If I choose **UP**, then in subsequent turns I could explore upwards toward (0, 7), which would bring me closer to more apples through later moves.\n3.

My previous move was to the right (to (4, 5)).\n2. Now I will evaluate my next potential position.\n3. The apple at (4, 6) is directly accessible by moving UP from my current position (4, 5).\n\n### Immediate Considerations:\n- If I move UP to (4, 6), I will consume the apple there and grow longer.\n- The enemy snake at (8, 6) poses a future threat but is currently far enough away that I can focus on harvesting the nearby apple.\n- It's vital to keep myself from colliding with any walls or my growing body in the following moves, so I need to keep track of my movement direction carefully.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nGiven all this analysis, the best option remains to simply move UP to eat the apple at (4, 6).\n\n**Next Move: UP**. \n\nAfter that, I will assess the new position and surrounding areas for further apples while being mindful of the enemy snake's location and the growing length of my body."

Given my current position, I should move towards free spaces that facilitate a path up the board directly or laterally towards the left side where apples are positioned.\n- **Enemy Snake Strategy:** The enemy snake pose a potential threat, and needs to be avoided. Staying on the right side of the board while maneuvering upwards should help in not crossing paths with them unnecessarily.\n\n### Proposed Move:\nGiven the options, moving **LEFT to (5, 8)** seems like the most beneficial move because it maintains my upward momentum while avoiding a potential direct confrontation with the enemy snake. \n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"
