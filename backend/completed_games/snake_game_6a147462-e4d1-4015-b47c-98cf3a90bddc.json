Since I'm currently at (1, 2), I can move up (y-1), down (y+1), left (x-1), or right (x+1).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. The closest apple is at (7, 6), which is up and to the right. However, moving up would put me closer to snake #2, which is at (1, 1). Moving to the right would take me away from the apple and closer to the wall.\n\nSo, a strategy could be to prioritize eating the apples and growing, but also avoid getting too close to other snakes. In this case, moving to the right or left would put me closer to the wall, and moving up would put me closer to snake #2. Therefore, the best option seems to be moving down (y+1).\n\nNext Move: DOWN."
