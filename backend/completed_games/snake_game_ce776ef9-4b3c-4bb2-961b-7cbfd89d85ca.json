            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1, currently at (8, 2). The apples are at (3,2), (8,4), (9,0), (0,5), and (8,7). The enemy snake is ID 2 at (2,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that the snake is on row 2, column 8. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The apple at (8,4) is directly above my snake, which is just two moves away if I move up. The apple at (8,7) is further up, but that's three moves away. The apple at (3,2) is to the left, but that's a bit of a distance. The one at (9,0) is near the bottom right, and (0,5) is on the left side.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the closest apple or a farther one. The apple at (8,4) is right above me, so that seems like an easy target. If I move up, I can reach it in one move and gain a point. But I should check if moving up is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the cell above me at (8,3) is empty, and the one above that at (8,4) has an apple. So moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) is safe, and then to (8,4) would be safe as well. There's no enemy snake nearby, and my body is only at (8,2), so I won't collide with myself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (9,2), but there's no apple there, and moving right might take me away from the apples. Moving left to (7,2) is also an option, but again, no apple there. Moving down to (8,1) is possible, but that's away from the apple at (8,4).\n\nSo, the most logical move is to go up towards (8,4). That way, I can collect the apple quickly and grow. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake at (2,0), as it's quite far away. Plus, since the enemy's body is empty, it's not a threat right now.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting the apple at (8,4), I might want to go for the apple at (8,7), which is further up. That would require moving up three times, but I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or my own body.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (8,3), then to (8,4), I can collect the apple. Then, from (8,4), moving up again to (8,5), and then to (8,6), and finally (8,7). That seems doable, but I need to make sure that the path is clear. Since the board is 10x10, moving up from (8,4) to (8,7) is within the bounds.\n\nAnother consideration: are there any other snakes that might block me? The enemy snake is at (2,0), so it's not in the way. My own body is only at (8,2), so as long as I don't move back down, I won't collide with myself.\n\nSo, the immediate next move should be UP to (8,3), then continue moving UP to collect the apple at (8,4). This seems like the best strategy for maximizing points without risking death.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move UP towards the apple at (8,4). This is safe and allows me to collect the apple quickly.\n\n**Next move: UP**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1, currently at (8, 2). The apples are at (3,2), (8,4), (9,0), (0,5), and (8,7). The enemy snake is ID 2 at (2,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that the snake is on row 2, column 8. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The apple at (8,4) is directly above my snake, which is just two moves away if I move up. The apple at (8,7) is further up, but that's three moves away. The apple at (3,2) is to the left, but that's a bit of a distance. The one at (9,0) is near the bottom right, and (0,5) is on the left side.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the closest apple or a farther one. The apple at (8,4) is right above me, so that seems like an easy target. If I move up, I can reach it in one move and gain a point. But I should check if moving up is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the cell above me at (8,3) is empty, and the one above that at (8,4) has an apple. So moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) is safe, and then to (8,4) would be safe as well. There's no enemy snake nearby, and my body is only at (8,2), so I won't collide with myself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (9,2), but there's no apple there, and moving right might take me away from the apples. Moving left to (7,2) is also an option, but again, no apple there. Moving down to (8,1) is possible, but that's away from the apple at (8,4).\n\nSo, the most logical move is to go up towards (8,4). That way, I can collect the apple quickly and grow. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake at (2,0), as it's quite far away. Plus, since the enemy's body is empty, it's not a threat right now.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting the apple at (8,4), I might want to go for the apple at (8,7), which is further up. That would require moving up three times, but I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or my own body.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (8,3), then to (8,4), I can collect the apple. Then, from (8,4), moving up again to (8,5), and then to (8,6), and finally (8,7). That seems doable, but I need to make sure that the path is clear. Since the board is 10x10, moving up from (8,4) to (8,7) is within the bounds.\n\nAnother consideration: are there any other snakes that might block me? The enemy snake is at (2,0), so it's not in the way. My own body is only at (8,2), so as long as I don't move back down, I won't collide with myself.\n\nSo, the immediate next move should be UP to (8,3), then continue moving UP to collect the apple at (8,4). This seems like the best strategy for maximizing points without risking death.\n\n**Next move: UP**"

The one at (9,0) is near the bottom right, and (0,5) is on the left side.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the closest apple or a farther one. The apple at (8,4) is right above me. That seems like an easy target. If I move up, I can reach it quickly and gain a point. I should check if moving up is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the cell above me at (8,3) is empty, and the one above that at (8,4) has an apple. So moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) is safe, and then to (8,4) would be safe as well. There's no enemy snake nearby, and my body is only at (8,2), so I won't collide with myself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (9,2), but there's no apple there, and moving right might take me away from the apples. Moving left to (7,2) is also an option, but again, no apple there. Moving down to (8,1) is possible, but that's away from the apple at (8,4).\n\nSo, the most logical move is to go up towards (8,4). That way, I can collect the apple quickly and grow. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake at (2,0), as it's quite far away. Plus, since the enemy's body is empty, it's not a threat right now.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting the apple at (8,4), I might want to go for the apple at (8,7), which is further up. That would require moving up three times, but I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or my own body.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (8,3), then to (8,4), I can collect the apple. Then, from (8,4), moving up again to (8,5), and then to (8,6), and finally (8,7). That seems doable, but I need to make sure that the path is clear. Since the board is 10x10, moving up from (8,4) to (8,7) is within the bounds.\n\nAnother consideration: are there any other snakes that might block me? The enemy snake is at (2,0), so it's not in the way. My own body is only at (8,2), so as long as I don't move back down, I won't collide with myself.\n\nSo, the immediate next move should be UP to (8,3), then continue moving UP to collect the apple at (8,4). This seems like the best strategy for maximizing points without risking death.\n\n**Next move: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to go UP towards the apple at (8,4). This will allow the snake to collect the apple quickly and grow without immediate threats.\n\n**Next move: UP**"

Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1, currently at (8, 2). The apples are at (3,2), (8,4), (9,0), (0,5), and (8,7). The enemy snake is ID 2 at (2,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that the snake is on row 2, column 8. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The apple at (8,4) is directly above my snake, which is just two moves away if I move up. The apple at (8,7) is further up, but that's three moves away. The apple at (3,2) is to the left, but that's a bit of a distance. The one at (9,0) is near the bottom right, and (0,5) is on the left side.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the closest apple or a farther one. The apple at (8,4) is right above me, so that seems like an easy target. If I move up, I can reach it in one move and gain a point. But I should check if moving up is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the cell above me at (8,3) is empty, and the one above that at (8,4) has an apple. So moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) is safe, and then to (8,4) would be safe as well. There's no enemy snake nearby, and my body is only at (8,2), so I won't collide with myself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (9,2), but there's no apple there, and moving right might take me away from the apples. Moving left to (7,2) is also an option, but again, no apple there. Moving down to (8,1) is possible, but that's away from the apple at (8,4).\n\nSo, the most logical move is to go up towards (8,4). That way, I can collect the apple quickly and grow. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake at (2,0), as it's quite far away. Plus, since the enemy's body is empty, it's not a threat right now.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting the apple at (8,4), I might want to go for the apple at (8,7), which is further up. That would require moving up three times, but I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or my own body.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (8,3), then to (8,4), I can collect the apple. Then, from (8,4), moving up again to (8,5), and then to (8,6), and finally (8,7). That seems doable, but I need to make sure that the path is clear. Since the board is 10x10, moving up from (8,4) to (8,7) is within the bounds.\n\nAnother consideration: are there any other snakes that might block me? The enemy snake is at (2,0), so it's not in the way. My own body is only at (8,2), so as long as I don't move back down, I won't collide with myself.\n\nSo, the immediate next move should be UP to (8,3), then continue moving UP to collect the apple at (8,4). This seems like the best strategy for maximizing points without risking death.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move UP towards the apple at (8,4).

Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (8, 7). Wait, no, looking back, the last move information says I was at (8, 2) and moved UP to (8, 3). But in the board state provided, my snake is at (8, 7). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. The board state shows my snake at (8,7), so perhaps the last move was a mistake or maybe I'm looking at a different turn. I'll go with the board state, so my snake is currently at (8,7).\n\nThe apples are located at (9,0), (0,5), (5,1), (2,8), and (3,3). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The enemy snake is number 2, at (5,2) with its body at (4,2). So, I need to avoid that area.\n\nLooking at the board, I'm at (8,7). The possible moves from here are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let me check each direction.\n\nUP from (8,7) would take me to (8,8). Is that safe? The board shows that (8,8) is empty, so that's possible. But wait, the apple at (2,8) is on the same row, but that's far away. Maybe I can go towards that later.\n\nDOWN from (8,7) would take me to (8,6). That's also empty, so that's an option. But I'm not sure what's beyond that.\n\nLEFT from (8,7) would take me to (7,7). That's also empty. Maybe that's a path to explore.\n\nRIGHT from (8,7) would take me to (9,7). But looking at the board, (9,7) is empty, so that's possible too. However, I should check if moving right might lead me towards any apples or if it's safer to go another way.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is at the top right corner, but that's far away. The apple at (0,5) is on the left side, which might be a longer path. The apple at (5,1) is near the bottom, and (3,3) is somewhere in the middle.\n\nSince I'm at (8,7), maybe I should look for the nearest apple. Let me see: the apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is a bit to the left and down. The apple at (2,8) is at (2,8), which is to the left and up from my current position.\n\nWait, (2,8) is at y=8, which is the top row. Since I'm at y=7, moving up once would take me to y=8. So, if I move UP from (8,7) to (8,8), I can then move LEFT towards (2,8). But I need to check if that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,8), moving LEFT would go through (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8). Are any of these squares occupied? The enemy snake is at (5,2) and (4,2), so that's not in the way. My own body is at (8,7), so moving up and left shouldn't collide with myself unless I have a longer body, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6), I could potentially go towards the apple at (5,1), but that's a longer path. Similarly, moving LEFT to (7,7) might not be as direct.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake at (5,2). If I move towards (2,8), I should make sure I don't get too close to the enemy. Since the enemy is at (5,2), which is lower on the board, moving up towards (2,8) should keep me away from them.\n\nSo, the immediate next move options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP seems like the most direct way to reach the apple at (2,8). It's only two moves away: UP to (8,8), then LEFT to (7,8), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (7,7) and then UP to (7,8) would also work, but it's two moves as well.\n\nI think moving UP is the best immediate next step because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,8) without any immediate obstacles. Plus, moving UP doesn't bring me closer to the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if moving UP might lead me into a position where I can't proceed further because of the board boundaries. Since I'm at (8,7), moving UP to (8,8) is still within the board, so that's fine. From there, moving LEFT is possible.\n\nAnother thought: the apple at (3,3) is also a target. From (8,7), moving LEFT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (2,8) is closer in terms of vertical movement.\n\nSo, to summarize, moving UP to (8,8) is the best next move because it's safe, gets me closer to an apple, and avoids any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to go UP to (8,8), which is safe and brings me closer to the apple at (2,8).\n\n**Next move: UP**"

The enemy snake is ID 2 at (2,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that the snake is on row 2, column 8. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The apple at (8,4) is directly above my snake, which is just two moves away if I move up. The apple at (8,7) is further up, but that's three moves away. The apple at (3,2) is to the left, but that's a bit of a distance. The one at (9,0) is near the bottom right, and (0,5) is on the left side.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the closest apple or a farther one. The apple at (8,4) is right above me, so that seems like an easy target. If I move up, I can reach it in one move and gain a point. But I should check if moving up is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the cell above me at (8,3) is empty, and the one above that at (8,4) has an apple. So moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) is safe, and then to (8,4) would be safe as well. There's no enemy snake nearby, and my body is only at (8,2), so I won't collide with myself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (9,2), but there's no apple there, and moving right might take me away from the apples. Moving left to (7,2) is also an option, but again, no apple there. Moving down to (8,1) is possible, but that's away from the apple at (8,4).\n\nSo, the most logical move is to go up towards (8,4). That way, I can collect the apple quickly and grow. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake at (2,0), as it's quite far away. Plus, since the enemy's body is empty, it's not a threat right now.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting the apple at (8,4), I might want to go for the apple at (8,7), which is further up. That would require moving up three times, but I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or my own body.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (8,3), then to (8,4), I can collect the apple. Then, from (8,4), moving up again to (8,5), and then to (8,6), and finally (8,7). That seems doable, but I need to make sure that the path is clear. Since the board is 10x10, moving up from (8,4) to (8,7) is within the bounds.\n\nAnother consideration: are there any other snakes that might block me?

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (8, 7). Wait, no, looking back, the last move information says I was at (8, 2) and moved UP to (8, 3). But in the board state provided, my snake is at (8, 7). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. The board state shows my snake at (8,7), so perhaps the last move was a mistake or maybe I'm looking at a different turn. I'll go with the board state, so my snake is currently at (8,7).\n\nThe apples are located at (9,0), (0,5), (5,1), (2,8), and (3,3). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The enemy snake is number 2, at (5,2) with its body at (4,2). So, I need to avoid that area.\n\nLooking at the board, I'm at (8,7). The possible moves from here are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let me check each direction.\n\nUP from (8,7) would take me to (8,8). Is that safe? The board shows that (8,8) is empty, so that's possible. But wait, the apple at (2,8) is on the same row, but that's far away. Maybe I can go towards that later.\n\nDOWN from (8,7) would take me to (8,6). That's also empty, so that's an option. But I'm not sure what's beyond that.\n\nLEFT from (8,7) would take me to (7,7). That's also empty. Maybe that's a path to explore.\n\nRIGHT from (8,7) would take me to (9,7). But looking at the board, (9,7) is empty, so that's possible too. However, I should check if moving right might lead me towards any apples or if it's safer to go another way.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is at the top right corner, but that's far away. The apple at (0,5) is on the left side, which might be a longer path. The apple at (5,1) is near the bottom, and (3,3) is somewhere in the middle.\n\nSince I'm at (8,7), maybe I should look for the nearest apple. Let me see: the apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is a bit to the left and down. The apple at (2,8) is at (2,8), which is to the left and up from my current position.\n\nWait, (2,8) is at y=8, which is the top row. Since I'm at y=7, moving up once would take me to y=8. So, if I move UP from (8,7) to (8,8), I can then move LEFT towards (2,8). But I need to check if that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,8), moving LEFT would go through (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8). Are any of these squares occupied? The enemy snake is at (5,2) and (4,2), so that's not in the way. My own body is at (8,7), so moving up and left shouldn't collide with myself unless I have a longer body, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6), I could potentially go towards the apple at (5,1), but that's a longer path. Similarly, moving LEFT to (7,7) might not be as direct.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake at (5,2). If I move towards (2,8), I should make sure I don't get too close to the enemy. Since the enemy is at (5,2), which is lower on the board, moving up towards (2,8) should keep me away from them.\n\nSo, the immediate next move options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP seems like the most direct way to reach the apple at (2,8). It's only two moves away: UP to (8,8), then LEFT to (7,8), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (7,7) and then UP to (7,8) would also work, but it's two moves as well.\n\nI think moving UP is the best immediate next step because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,8) without any immediate obstacles. Plus, moving UP doesn't bring me closer to the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if moving UP might lead me into a position where I can't proceed further because of the board boundaries. Since I'm at (8,7), moving UP to (8,8) is still within the board, so that's fine. From there, moving LEFT is possible.\n\nAnother thought: the apple at (3,3) is also a target. From (8,7), moving LEFT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (2,8) is closer in terms of vertical movement.\n\nSo, to summarize, moving UP to (8,8) is the best next move because it's safe, gets me closer to an apple, and avoids any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to go UP to (8,8), which is safe and brings me closer to the apple at (2,8).\n\n**Next move: UP**"

The enemy snake is ID 2 at (2,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that the snake is on row 2, column 8. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The apple at (8,4) is directly above my snake, which is just two moves away if I move up. The apple at (8,7) is further up, but that's three moves away. The apple at (3,2) is to the left, but that's a bit of a distance. The one at (9,0) is near the bottom right, and (0,5) is on the left side.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the closest apple or a farther one. The apple at (8,4) is right above me, so that seems like an easy target. If I move up, I can reach it in one move and gain a point. But I should check if moving up is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the cell above me at (8,3) is empty, and the one above that at (8,4) has an apple. So moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) is safe, and then to (8,4) would be safe as well. There's no enemy snake nearby, and my body is only at (8,2), so I won't collide with myself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (9,2), but there's no apple there, and moving right might take me away from the apples. Moving left to (7,2) is also an option, but again, no apple there. Moving down to (8,1) is possible, but that's away from the apple at (8,4).\n\nSo, the most logical move is to go up towards (8,4). That way, I can collect the apple quickly and grow. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake at (2,0), as it's quite far away.

The enemy snake is at (2,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (8,4) is directly above my snake. That seems like an easy target.

I should check if moving up is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the cell above me at (8,3) is empty, and the one above that at (8,4) has an apple. So moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) is safe, and then to (8,4) would be safe as well. There's no enemy snake nearby, and my body is only at (8,2), so I won't collide with myself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (9,2), but there's no apple there, and moving right might take me away from the apples.

Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (8, 7). Wait, no, looking back, the last move information says I was at (8, 2) and moved UP to (8, 3). But in the board state provided, my snake is at (8, 7). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. The board state shows my snake at (8,7), so perhaps the last move was a mistake or maybe I'm looking at a different turn. I'll go with the board state, so my snake is currently at (8,7).\n\nThe apples are located at (9,0), (0,5), (5,1), (2,8), and (3,3). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The enemy snake is number 2, at (5,2) with its body at (4,2). So, I need to avoid that area.\n\nLooking at the board, I'm at (8,7). The possible moves from here are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let me check each direction.\n\nUP from (8,7) would take me to (8,8). Is that safe? The board shows that (8,8) is empty, so that's possible. But wait, the apple at (2,8) is on the same row, but that's far away. Maybe I can go towards that later.\n\nDOWN from (8,7) would take me to (8,6). That's also empty, so that's an option. But I'm not sure what's beyond that.\n\nLEFT from (8,7) would take me to (7,7). That's also empty. Maybe that's a path to explore.\n\nRIGHT from (8,7) would take me to (9,7). But looking at the board, (9,7) is empty, so that's possible too. However, I should check if moving right might lead me towards any apples or if it's safer to go another way.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is at the top right corner, but that's far away. The apple at (0,5) is on the left side, which might be a longer path. The apple at (5,1) is near the bottom, and (3,3) is somewhere in the middle.\n\nSince I'm at (8,7), maybe I should look for the nearest apple. Let me see: the apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is a bit to the left and down. The apple at (2,8) is at (2,8), which is to the left and up from my current position.\n\nWait, (2,8) is at y=8, which is the top row. Since I'm at y=7, moving up once would take me to y=8. So, if I move UP from (8,7) to (8,8), I can then move LEFT towards (2,8). But I need to check if that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,8), moving LEFT would go through (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8). Are any of these squares occupied? The enemy snake is at (5,2) and (4,2), so that's not in the way. My own body is at (8,7), so moving up and left shouldn't collide with myself unless I have a longer body, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6), I could potentially go towards the apple at (5,1), but that's a longer path. Similarly, moving LEFT to (7,7) might not be as direct.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake at (5,2). If I move towards (2,8), I should make sure I don't get too close to the enemy. Since the enemy is at (5,2), which is lower on the board, moving up towards (2,8) should keep me away from them.\n\nSo, the immediate next move options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP seems like the most direct way to reach the apple at (2,8). It's only two moves away: UP to (8,8), then LEFT to (7,8), and so on. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (7,7) and then UP to (7,8) would also work, but it's two moves as well.\n\nI think moving UP is the best immediate next step because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,8) without any immediate obstacles. Plus, moving UP doesn't bring me closer to the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if moving UP might lead me into a position where I can't proceed further because of the board boundaries. Since I'm at (8,7), moving UP to (8,8) is still within the board, so that's fine. From there, moving LEFT is possible.\n\nAnother thought: the apple at (3,3) is also a target. From (8,7), moving LEFT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (2,8) is closer in terms of vertical movement.\n\nSo, to summarize, moving UP to (8,8) is the best next move because it's safe, gets me closer to an apple, and avoids any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to go UP to (8,8), which is safe and brings me closer to the apple at (2,8).\n\n**Next move: UP**"
