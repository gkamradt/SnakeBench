Since we grew by eating, our tail (5,8) doesn\u2019t move this turn.\n\n\u25ba Our apples remaining are at (8,5), (2,4), (1,0), (8,4), and (1,5). Looking at their distances from our head (4,8), the apple at (1,5) is quite attractive (it\u2019s 3 left and 3 down) as is the one at (2,4) (2 left, 4 down). We need to pick a direction that keeps our options open without risking immediate collision.\n\n\u25ba Considering our possible moves from (4,8):  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 UP \u2192 (4,9) is safe but takes us away from any apple.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 DOWN \u2192 (4,7) is safe. Moving down can eventually be part of a path toward apples on the lower half, but it tends to commit us more downward.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 LEFT \u2192 (3,8) is safe and will bring us closer to the cluster of apples in the bottom-left area (like (1,5) or (2,4)).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) is not allowed since that is our own body that just got added (and it would be like going backwards).\n\n\u25ba We should also note enemy snake #2 is over in the lower left (its head at (3,4) and body at (3,5)) but they aren\u2019t immediately adjacent to us. By choosing LEFT, we steer clear and can later maneuver carefully around that enemy.\n\n\u25ba Overall, moving LEFT to (3,8) is a safe option that puts us in a good position to continue heading toward a nearby apple (probably (1,5) after a few moves).\n\nThus, my next decided move is: LEFT."

I just collected one apple and my goal is to continue gathering more apples while avoiding running into myself or enemy snakes.\n\nLet's evaluate my available moves again:\n\n1. **UP to (3, 6)**: This move is illegal because I would be moving onto my body which isn't allowed.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 4)**: Moving down to (3, 4) is legal, but there are no immediate apples there, so I would neither score points nor enhance my position significantly.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 5)**: This is a safe move to an empty space, but once again, no apples are available, and positioning doesn\u2019t favor future moves toward apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 5)**: Another safe move to an empty space without immediate scoring but retains some potential for future moves to apples.\n\nBased on my current strategy, I'm finding that moving DOWN to (3, 4) feels a little stagnant because it may limit my movement options next turn, while both moving LEFT and RIGHT maintain some flexibility.\n\nSince there are apples at (2, 4) and (1, 0) which I might want to pursue in future turns, moving left to (2, 5) would help me progress toward those apple coordinates without being blocked. While it's not a point-scoring move right now, it positions me for better access next turn.\n\n**Refined Strategy for Next Turn:**\n1. Move to open up more potential routes toward apples in the subsequent turn.\n2. Keep the enemy snake's position in mind and avoid areas that may potentially block my access to apples later.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will make the move:\n\n**LEFT**."

Since we grew by eating, our tail (5,8) doesn\u2019t move this turn.\n\n\u25ba Our apples remaining are at (8,5), (2,4), (1,0), (8,4), and (1,5). Looking at their distances from our head (4,8), the apple at (1,5) is quite attractive (it\u2019s 3 left and 3 down) as is the one at (2,4) (2 left, 4 down). We need to pick a direction that keeps our options open without risking immediate collision.\n\n\u25ba Considering our possible moves from (4,8):  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 UP \u2192 (4,9) is safe but takes us away from any apple.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 DOWN \u2192 (4,7) is safe. Moving down can eventually be part of a path toward apples on the lower half, but it tends to commit us more downward.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 LEFT \u2192 (3,8) is safe and will bring us closer to the cluster of apples in the bottom-left area (like (1,5) or (2,4)).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) is not allowed since that is our own body that just got added (and it would be like going backwards).\n\n\u25ba We should also note enemy snake #2 is over in the lower left (its head at (3,4) and body at (3,5)) but they aren\u2019t immediately adjacent to us. By choosing LEFT, we steer clear and can later maneuver carefully around that enemy.\n\n\u25ba Overall, moving LEFT to (3,8) is a safe option that puts us in a good position to continue heading toward a nearby apple (probably (1,5) after a few moves).\n\nThus, my next decided move is: LEFT."

Moving down can eventually be part of a path toward apples on the lower half, but it tends to commit us more downward.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 LEFT \u2192 (3,8) is safe and will bring us closer to the cluster of apples in the bottom-left area (like (1,5) or (2,4)).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) is not allowed since that is our own body that just got added (and it would be like going backwards).\n\n\u25ba We should also note enemy snake #2 is over in the lower left (its head at (3,4) and body at (3,5)) but they aren\u2019t immediately adjacent to us. By choosing LEFT, we steer clear and can later maneuver carefully around that enemy.\n\n\u25ba Overall, moving LEFT to (3,8) is a safe option that puts us in a good position to continue heading toward a nearby apple (probably (1,5) after a few moves).\n\nThus, my next decided move is: LEFT."
