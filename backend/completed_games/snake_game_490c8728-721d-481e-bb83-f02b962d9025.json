My main concern is the apple at (4, 7), which is relatively close and not too far from my current position. However, I also need to be mindful of the wall at the top of the board, since moving up would put me at (9, 4), which is outside the board.\n\nI think I'll play it safe and move... RIGHT. This will keep me within the board and give me a chance to get closer to the apple at (4, 7) without taking too many risks.\n\nNext turn strategy: I'll continue to move towards the apple at (4, 7) and see if I can get closer to it without running into any issues. If I do get closer, I'll try to eat the apple and grow my snake. If not, I'll reassess my options and try to find a new path.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
