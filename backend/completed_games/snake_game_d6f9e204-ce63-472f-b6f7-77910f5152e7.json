The enemy snake (at (5, 9)) is very far from my intended path, so I don\u2019t have to worry about it right now, and there are no immediate obstacles along the way. \n\nMy strategy is to keep reducing the Manhattan distance toward (2,2) while avoiding any walls (given the board\u2019s limits). I\u2019ll keep mapping out the safest path toward the target apple on subsequent turns.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
