(8, 1) - Moving right is possible but moves toward potential conflict with the enemy.\n  5.

Instead, I should explore moves that lead me toward apples while ensuring that I don't put myself in danger.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP to (6, 3)**: This keeps me away from potential conflict. While it doesn't lead me directly to an apple, it keeps my options open for future turns.\n2. **RIGHT to (7, 2)**: This takes me directly towards the enemy snake, posing unnecessary risk.\n3. **DOWN to (6, 1)**: This would place me back to my previous position and effectively wasting a turn.\n4. **LEFT to (5, 2)**: This could be beneficial as it puts me in a position closer to (5, 4) while avoiding conflict with the enemy.\n\nAfter weighing my options, moving **UP** to (6, 3) seems the best choice as it keeps me temporarily safe and allows time to evaluate the next best move based on the enemy snake's position and any potential opportunities to collect apples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven all considerations, my next move will be:\n\n**UP**"

(4, 6) - Far away and not reachable on the next turn.\n2. (3, 0) - Off board.\n3. (5, 4) - Now reachable, as I can move directly down to (5, 3), which is two moves away.\n4. (8, 1) - Moving toward this would lead me too close to enemy #2.\n5. (3, 2) - Risky, as it takes me closer to the enemy and doesn't lead to an apple.\n\n**Enemy Snake Position**: \n- Snake #2 is still at (7, 4), which means moving up to (6, 4) and right to (7, 4) creates a direct conflict.\n\n### Possible Moves from (6, 3):\n1. **UP to (6, 4)**: This puts me directly into a conflict with the enemy.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 2)**: Moving back to my last position, which is pointless.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 3)**: Moving to (5, 3) gets me one step closer to the apple at (5, 4).\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 3)**: This adds danger as it gets closer to the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategic Thoughts:\nThe best option here is moving **LEFT to (5, 3)**. This not only allows me to prepare for my next turn to reach the apple at (5, 4), but it also keeps me safe from the enemy while avoiding any backtracking.\n\n**Next Move Decision:**\n\nI will move:\n\n**LEFT** to (5, 3)."
