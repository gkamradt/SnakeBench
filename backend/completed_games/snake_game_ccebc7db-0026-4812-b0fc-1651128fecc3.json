Let's evaluate our options from here:\n\n1. **LEFT** - Moving LEFT to (6, 4) brings us closer horizontally to the apple at (6, 3). There's no immediate threat from this direction as there are no other snakes or walls. This move puts us in a good position to next move DOWN to reach and eat the apple at (6, 3).\n\n2. **RIGHT** - Moving RIGHT to (8, 4) is not advisable as it doesn\u2019t bring us closer to any apple and it is moving toward the wall which limits future options.\n\n3. **UP** - Moving UP to (7, 5) is safe but it doesn\u2019t help us reach any apples quickly. It also moves us further away from the closest apple at (6, 3).\n\n4. **DOWN** - Moving DOWN to (7, 3) is also safe and aligns vertically with the apple at (6, 3). However, moving LEFT first then steering DOWN might provide a better trajectory for continuous movement to collect the apple swiftly without reversing or stalling.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- After moving LEFT to (6, 4) next, evaluate the possibility of moving DOWN (to (6, 3)) to get the apple unless new apples or snake movements suggest a better path.\n\nNext move: **LEFT**."
