            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (6,5). There's another snake, ID 2, at (7,4), and it doesn't have any body segments listed, so it's just the head there.\n\nThe apples are located at (0,2), (7,0), (2,9), (0,9), and (7,9). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without dying.\n\nLooking at the board, my snake is at (6,5). The possible moves are up, down, left, or right. Let me check each direction:\n\n- Up from (6,5) would take me to (6,6). Is that safe? I don't see any apples there, and the enemy snake is at (7,4), so that's not a threat. But I don't gain any points either.\n- Down would take me to (6,4). That's also empty, but again, no apple.\n- Left would take me to (5,5). Still empty.\n- Right would take me to (7,5). Wait, the enemy snake is at (7,4), so moving right to (7,5) would be adjacent but not directly into it. But I need to check if moving right is safe. Since the enemy is at (7,4), moving to (7,5) is just above it, which is fine. But is there an apple there? No, the apples are at (7,0) and (7,9). So moving right might not get me an apple immediately.\n\nWait, but maybe I should look for the closest apple. The apple at (7,0) is directly below the enemy snake. If I move down towards (7,0), but my current position is (6,5). Moving down would take me to (6,4), then (6,3), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving right towards (7,5) and then down to (7,4) might get me near the enemy, but I don't want to collide.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the other apples: (0,2), (2,9), (0,9), and (7,9). The one at (7,9) is at the top right. That's a good spot because it's far from the enemy, but I'm at (6,5), so moving up to (6,6), then (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), and then right to (7,9). That's a possible path, but it's a bit long.\n\nAnother apple is at (2,9). That's on the top left. To get there, I'd have to move left from (6,5) to (2,5), then up to (2,9). That's also a distance.\n\nThe apple at (0,2) is on the bottom left. To get there, I'd have to move left to (0,5), then down to (0,2). But that's a long way, and I might run into walls or the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (0,9) is on the top left. From (6,5), moving left to (0,5), then up to (0,9). That's also a distance.\n\nSo, considering all the apples, the closest one in terms of steps might be (7,0), but it's below the enemy. Alternatively, (7,9) is on the same column as my current position but up.\n\nWait, let me think about the enemy's position. Snake 2 is at (7,4). If I move right to (7,5), I'm just above the enemy. But since the enemy is at (7,4), moving to (7,5) is safe because it's not overlapping. However, if I move down from (7,5) to (7,4), that's where the enemy is, so I can't do that. So moving right is safe for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (7,9). Let me plan the path:\n\nFrom (6,5), move right to (7,5), then up to (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). That's 4 moves up. That seems doable. But I need to make sure that the path is clear and I don't run into any walls or the enemy.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (7,4). If I move right to (7,5), the enemy is at (7,4), so I'm not colliding. Then, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6), etc., is safe because the enemy is not moving (since it's just the head and no body). So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up from (6,5) to (6,6), then right to (7,6), and then up to (7,9). That's also a possible path, but it's longer.\n\nWait, but moving right to (7,5) is just one step, and then up four steps. That's efficient.\n\nBut I should also check if moving right is the best option. Let me see the board again. The board shows that at row 7, there's an apple at (7,0) and (7,9). So (7,9) is the top right corner.\n\nAnother thought: the apple at (7,0) is directly below the enemy. If I move down towards (7,0), I might get closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous. So maybe it's better to go for the apple at (7,9) instead.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (7,5), then up to (7,9) to eat that apple. That would give me a point. But I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nWait, but when I move right to (7,5), I'm now at (7,5). From there, moving up to (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Each step, I need to check if the next position is safe.\n\nAt (7,5), moving up to (7,6) is safe because there's no snake there. Similarly, (7,7), (7,8), and (7,9) are all empty. So that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up first to (6,6), then right to (7,6), and then up to (7,9). But that's more steps, so moving right first is better.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (7,4). If I move right to (7,5), I'm just above the enemy. But since the enemy is only at (7,4), and I'm moving to (7,5), that's fine. The enemy's body is empty, so it's just the head. So I won't collide with it.\n\nWait, but if I move right to (7,5), and then up, I'm moving away from the enemy, so that's safe.\n\nSo, the best move is to go right to (7,5), then proceed up to (7,9) to eat the apple. That gives me a point, and it's a safe path.\n\nAlternatively, I could also consider the apple at (2,9). Let me see how far that is. From (6,5), moving left to (2,5), then up to (2,9). That's 4 steps left and 4 steps up, totaling 8 steps. That's longer than going to (7,9), which is 5 steps (right 1, up 4). So (7,9) is closer.\n\nAnother thought: the apple at (0,9) is also on the top left. From (6,5), moving left to (0,5), then up to (0,9). That's 6 steps left and 4 up, totaling 10 steps. That's even longer.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (7,9), which is 5 steps away. So that's the best target.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the right to (7,5). That's one step towards the apple at (7,9). It's safe, and it gets me closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving right is the best immediate move. Let me think about the possible dangers. If I move right to (7,5), is there any chance of colliding with the enemy? The enemy is at (7,4), so I'm moving to (7,5), which is above it. That's fine because the enemy is only at (7,4), and I'm moving to (7,5), which is an empty space.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that moving right doesn't take me into any walls or my own body. My body is only at (6,5), so moving right to (7,5) is clear.\n\nSo, yes, moving right is safe and gets me closer to the apple at (7,9). Therefore, I should move right.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move right to (7,5) to approach the apple at (7,9) safely.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (6,5).\n2. **Apple Locations:** The closest apple is at (7,9), which is 5 steps away.\n3. **Path Analysis:** Moving right to (7,5) is safe and leads towards the apple.\n4. **Safety Check:** No collision with walls, enemy, or self.\n5. **Decision:** Move right to (7,5) to proceed towards the apple at (7,9).\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "First, let's identify the available moves that won't result in a collision with the wall or other snakes. Since I'm currently at (7, 4), I can move up (to (7, 3)), down (to (7, 5)), left (to (6, 4)), or right (to (8, 4)).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples and my goal to gain points. The apples are located at (0, 2), (7, 0), (2, 9), (0, 9), and (7, 9). Since I'm already at (7, 4), moving left (to (6, 4)) would not help me reach any apples. Moving right (to (8, 4)) would bring me closer to the apple at (7, 9), but it's further away than the apple at (2, 9).\n\nMoving up (to (7, 3)) or down (to (7, 5)) would not bring me closer to any apples. However, moving up would bring me closer to the enemy snake (#1) at (6, 5).\n\nGiven these considerations, I will move up (to (7, 3)) to avoid the enemy snake and potentially give me a chance to reach an apple in the future.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards an apple while avoiding the enemy snakes.\n\nNext move: UP"
