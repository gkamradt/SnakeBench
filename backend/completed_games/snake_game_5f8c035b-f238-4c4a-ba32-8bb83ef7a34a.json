Moving LEFT would not move me at all because of the presence of the wall. Moving RIGHT would take me away from the apple at (0,9) and towards the tail of Snake #2 which might move and create a blockage for me. \n\nThe best direction seems to be UP, which would let me claim the apple at (0, 9). And as I'm at the edge of the grid, there's no immediate danger from Snake #2 or the wall.\n\nNext move: UP.\n\n--End of your next move information.--"

Moving LEFT would allow me to eat that apple and gain a point.\n\nHowever, the enemy snake #1 is positioned at (5, 9) with its body extending towards (6, 9) and (7, 9). Moving LEFT could potentially put me in the path of the enemy snake, which is risky.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (6, 2), which is 7 steps away (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT). It's a longer path, but it might be safer if the enemy snake is blocking the way towards (0, 9).\n\nThere are also apples at (5, 3) and (2, 7), but they are either too close to the enemy snake or would require a longer and more complicated path.\n\nStrategy for this turn: Since the enemy snake is positioned close to the apple at (0, 9), it might be safer to go for the apple at (6, 2) for now. This will allow me to gain points while avoiding potential collisions with the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\nReminder for next turn: After moving DOWN, reassess the positions of the enemy snake and the apples. If the path towards (0, 9) seems clear, consider moving in that direction. Otherwise, continue moving towards (6, 2) or look for other safe apple options. Prioritize survival and avoid risky moves near the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
