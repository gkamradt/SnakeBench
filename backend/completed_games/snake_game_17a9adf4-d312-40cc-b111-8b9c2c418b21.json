However, moving directly to this apple would require me to move left, and I'd have to navigate through the board to get there.\n\nAnother option is to move up towards the apple at (0, 9) or (9, 8), but I need to be cautious of the enemy snake at (7, 9). Since the enemy snake has no body, it's likely just started, and I should be able to avoid it for now.\n\nConsidering the layout, moving up seems like a good initial move, as it allows me to potentially get closer to the apples at (0, 9) or (9, 8) while also keeping an eye on the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns will be to prioritize moving towards the closest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adjusting my path accordingly.\n\nNext turn, I'll reassess the board state and consider moving left towards the apple at (3, 6) if it's still available.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
