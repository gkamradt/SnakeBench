To reach this apple, I need to decrease both my x and y coordinates. The most efficient first step would be to start moving in one of these directions. Since moving down (decreasing y-coordinate) would bring me closer to the center and potentially offer more flexibility in responding to Snake #1's next move or other emerging threats, the initial direction should prioritize this.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn (After Executing This Move)**\n\n* After moving DOWN to (7, 8):\n\t1. **Reassess Snake #1's Position**: Update threat level based on its movement.\n\t2. **Continue Towards (2, 1)**: If safe, proceed with a combination of DOWN and LEFT moves to reach the apple.\n\n**Decided Next Move**\n\nTo start moving towards the apple at (2, 1) while maintaining flexibility, I'll decrease my y-coordinate.\n\n**NEXT MOVE: DOWN**"
