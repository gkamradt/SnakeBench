The possibilities are:\n\n1. **UP (to (8, 6))**: This brings me back to my previous position, which doesn't gain me any new advantage.\n2. **DOWN (to (8, 4))**: The cell is empty, and if I continue downward in future turns, I can explore towards the bottom and potentially head towards available apples later.\n3. **LEFT (to (7, 5))**: This takes me away from current apples, but it could allow me to explore upward and gain more future options.\n4. **RIGHT (to (9, 5))**: This leads to an empty space as well but merely moves me toward the edge of the board without providing any immediate benefit.\n\nConsidering that I am aiming to grow my snake by eating apples, I see DOWNS as the most strategic direction. Moving DOWN will keep me mobile, giving me the chance to either continue downward or maneuver left or right on subsequent turns without having to retrace my steps back.\n\nMoving DOWN also keeps me toward the bottom row where apples like (3, 1), (5, 1), or (0, 3) could be targeted in future moves.\n\nI\u2019ll continue with my intended strategy of moving toward the available apple spaces while maintaining flexibility in my future options.\n\nDecided next move: **DOWN**."

Right now, I'm at (8, 4) after moving down, and the available apples near me are at coordinates (3,1), (5,1), (7,1), and (0,3). \n\nNext move considerations from (8, 4) would be:\n1. **UP (to (8, 5))**: This leads me back to my previous position; not beneficial.\n2. **DOWN (to (8, 3))**: Moves me to an empty cell, potentially allowing for further maneuvering, but doesn\u2019t bring me closer to apples.\n3. **LEFT (to (7, 4))**: This is also an empty cell, but again does not advance me toward a target apple.\n4. **RIGHT (to (9, 4))**: This cell is empty but moves closer to the edge of the board without benefiting my current objective of getting closer to the apples.\n\nGiven that moving DOWN or LEFT does not progress me toward any apples and moving UP takes me back, the clearer option appears to be moving LEFT towards (7, 4). This still allows for better mobility in a future turn and getting closer to the apples horizontally, particularly to (5, 1).\n\nGiven the lack of imminent threats from the enemy (as they are on the opposite corner of the board), I can take this minor detour without penalty while considering my next moves.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: LEFT."
