However, it doesn\u2019t directly move you toward the closest apple.\n\u2003\u2013 Moving DOWN goes to (7,7), which is free, but it moves you away from the cluster of apples in the upper rows.\n\n\u2022 Notice that the apple at (4,9) is only 4 steps away by Manhattan distance (|7\u20134| + |8\u20139| = 3 + 1 = 4). Although you can\u2019t go directly upward because of the blocked cell, you can reach it by approaching from below:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If you move LEFT, you go from (7,8) to (6,8).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then, on subsequent moves you could continue LEFT to (5,8) and then (4,8), which would allow you to go UP into (4,9).\n\n\u2022 The enemy snake (#2) is at (5,6) and is unlikely to interfere with this planned route.\n\nThus, the optimal next move to start heading toward the apple at (4,9) (and ultimately boost your score) is to move LEFT.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
