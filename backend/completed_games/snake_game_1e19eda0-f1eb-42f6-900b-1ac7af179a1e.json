There are several apples located on the right side of the board at (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 9), and (8, 9).\n\nGiven this information, my strategy for the next move should be to continue moving to the right to approach those apples on the right side of the board. This will allow me to potentially eat multiple apples and grow my snake, while also keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nAdditionally, moving right will keep me away from the wall on the left side of the board, reducing the risk of running into it.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be: RIGHT\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving towards the apples on the right side, unless I encounter a situation where moving in a different direction becomes necessary to avoid a collision or secure an apple.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
