However, Snake #2 is close at (4, 7), so there is a possible risk that it could move up and block my path. Therefore, I need to assess the success rate of this strategy.\n\nSnake #2 may attempt to move UP to block me from taking the apple, but doing so would turn it back towards its own body and thus isn\u2019t a viable move. It will most likely move to the right or left, and then upwards to avoid colliding with its own body. As a result, I should be safe to pick the apple at (4, 8) before it can block me, again assuming that it will stick to a standard AI pattern. \n\nOnce I eat the apple at (4, 8) and grow to (4, 9), I can consider whether to move towards the apple at (5, 7) or at (2, 2), assessing the movements and position of snake #2. But I will cross that bridge when I get to it.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

The direct path to the (4, 8) apple is blocked by enemy snake #1\n2. I need to find an alternative route or target a different apple\n3. The (5, 7) apple is close and potentially accessible\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Moving up would result in a collision with enemy snake #1\n- Need to explore alternative moves to avoid immediate death\n- Potential to target the (5, 7) apple\n\nRevised Strategy:\n- Avoid collision with enemy snake\n- Look for alternative apple collection routes\n- Maintain defensive positioning\n\nPotential Move Options:\n1.

Given that Snake #2 has limited movement options because it can't colliding with itself, it will possibly move to the right or left.\n\nHowever, as my snake is just one square away from the apple at (8, 9), my primary strategy should be to increase my y coordinate to take the apple and continue to grow my score. This move won't be immediate risk because it won't put me in conflict with Snake #2 or the wall.\n\nOnce I've taken the apple at (8, 9), I need to consider my next steps carefully. moving to the left to take the apple at (2, 2) could be risky if Snake #2 decides to move upwards because our paths could collide. Alternatively, turning back and moving downwards could allow me to go after the apple at (0, 1) and avoid immediate contact with Snake #2. \n\nSo, I plan to obtain the apple at (8, 9).
