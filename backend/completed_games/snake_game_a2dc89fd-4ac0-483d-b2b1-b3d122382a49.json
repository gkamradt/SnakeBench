The apples are at (6, 1), (3, 7), (0, 1), (4, 9), and (4, 3), and Snake #2 is positioned right below me at (3, 4). \n\nLet's prioritize our strategy and goals:\n\n1. **Primary Goal**: Capture an apple to grow and earn points.\n2. **Immediate Threats**: Avoid Snake #2 at (3, 4). Currently, this enemy snake presents no immediate threat as it doesn't block my path to the nearest apple.\n3. **Optimal Apple Target**: The closest apple remains at (4, 3). This apple is just two steps away (downwards then to the right), and no immediate threats impede this path.\n\nHere\u2019s my revised analysis:\n\n- I'm currently at (3, 5). Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 5) aligns me directly above the apple at (4, 3). \n- From (4, 5), the next most efficient move will be to move **DOWN** to (4, 4), putting me just one step away from the apple at (4, 3).\n\nGiven the current lack of threats directly in this path, proceeding with caution but decisively is advisable. I'll stick with the strategy to move closer to the apple at (4, 3), which remains our best target based on current board observations.\n\nNext Move: **RIGHT**\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n- After moving to (4, 5), move down to (4, 4) if conditions remain the same.\n- Continuously re-evaluate for any moves from Snake #2 or any new developments on the board, steering clear of potential collisions or traps."
