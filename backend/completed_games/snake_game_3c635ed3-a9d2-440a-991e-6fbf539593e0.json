This will bring me closer to the next apple while avoiding the enemy snake (#2) and any walls or my own body.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious as my body will start growing, making it more challenging to maneuver. I should keep an eye on the movements of the enemy snake and plan my moves accordingly to avoid colliding with it or trapping myself.\n\nAfter reaching the apple at (7, 2), I should look for the next closest and safest apple to move towards, while also monitoring the positions of the enemy snakes and my own body.\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: Once I reach the apple at (7, 2), I should assess the positions of the remaining apples, the enemy snakes, and the growth of my own body to determine the safest and most efficient path to the next apple. I should also be mindful of potential traps or situations where I might cut off my own movement."
