Considering the apples nearby, I see an apple on the next square to my up at (1, 4). To reach that apple and grow, I need to go right next step and then up for 2 steps and move there. However, I notice that going upward immediately could risk me running into the snake #1 if it changes direction. To balance both the direct gain and potential threats, let's plan a safer path by first going RIGHT and then moving UP next turn to ensure we pass the direct danger to Closed-up when moving forward. So, I'll go RIGHT this move, to position myself effectively, and shine my way through the next move to UP. \n\nNEXT MOVE: RIGHT"
