Snake #1 is still at position (9, 4) with its body at [(8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)].\n\nMoving left or right wouldn't make sense since I'm already at the rightmost edge of the board, and moving up would take me away from the apple. \n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (9, 1) unless I see a better opportunity or a potential threat from Snake #1.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."
