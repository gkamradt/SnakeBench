However, this move doesn't lead me toward any apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Moves me towards the center where there are more apples.\n   - **Cons:** There's an apple at (5, 2), but it's a bit far, and I might risk running into other snakes.\n\n### Assessing the Apples\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- **(0, 5):** Closest to moving DOWN from (1, 6).\n- **(4, 4) & (4, 5):** These are farther away but in the center.\n- **(5, 9) & (5, 2):** These are on the right side.\n\nThe apple at (0, 5) is the most accessible from my current position.\n\n### Considering Threats\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0, 2), which is below me. Moving DOWN would take me closer to it, but since it's stationary with no body segments, the immediate threat is low. However, it's always good to minimize interactions with other snakes.\n\n### Deciding on the Best Move\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n- Moving **DOWN** to (1, 5) would bring me adjacent to the apple at (0, 5), allowing me to potentially grow and gain a point.\n- Moving **RIGHT** could lead me towards more apples in the center, but it's a longer path and might be riskier.\n- Moving **UP** or **LEFT** doesn't offer immediate benefits in terms of collecting apples.\n\nTherefore, the most advantageous move seems to be **DOWN**, as it allows me to collect an apple without exposing myself to significant threats.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (1, 5) and potentially eating the apple at (0, 5), I should consider my next move to continue collecting apples while avoiding the enemy snake. Planning to move towards the center where multiple apples are located would be strategic.\n\n**Next Move:** **DOWN**"

However, this move doesn't lead me toward any apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Moves me towards the center where there are more apples.\n   - **Cons:** There's an apple at (5, 2), but it's a bit far, and I might risk running into other snakes.\n\n### Assessing the Apples\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- **(0, 5):** Closest to moving DOWN from (1, 6).\n- **(4, 4) & (4, 5):** These are farther away but in the center.\n- **(5, 9) & (5, 2):** These are on the right side.\n\nThe apple at (0, 5) is the most accessible from my current position.\n\n### Considering Threats\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0, 2), which is below me. Moving DOWN would take me closer to it, but since it's stationary with no body segments, the immediate threat is low. However, it's always good to minimize interactions with other snakes.\n\n### Deciding on the Best Move\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n- Moving **DOWN** to (1, 5) would bring me adjacent to the apple at (0, 5), allowing me to potentially grow and gain a point.\n- Moving **RIGHT** could lead me towards more apples in the center, but it's a longer path and might be riskier.\n- Moving **UP** or **LEFT** doesn't offer immediate benefits in terms of collecting apples.\n\nTherefore, the most advantageous move seems to be **DOWN**, as it allows me to collect an apple without exposing myself to significant threats.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (1, 5) and potentially eating the apple at (0, 5), I should consider my next move to continue collecting apples while avoiding the enemy snake. Planning to move towards the center where multiple apples are located would be strategic.\n\n**Next Move:** **DOWN**"
