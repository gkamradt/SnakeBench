Available moves:\n   - LEFT would hit my body\n   - DOWN would hit my body\n   - UP is clear and leads toward two apples\n   - RIGHT is clear and leads toward multiple apples\n\nStrategy:\nThe closest apple is still (2, 5). I have two good options:\n1. Move UP to then approach (2, 5) from above\n2. Move RIGHT to approach it directly\n\nMoving UP seems optimal because:\n- It moves me closer to both (2, 5) and (1, 8)\n- Gives me vertical flexibility\n- Keeps me away from my tail\n- Creates more space for future movements\n\nNote for next turn:\nAfter moving UP, I'll be at (1, 5), and can then decide whether to go right toward (2, 5) or continue up toward (1, 8).\n\nUP"
