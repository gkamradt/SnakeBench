The board (with X increasing to the right and Y increasing upward) shows this row at y = 9:\n\u2003\u2003. . . . . . 2 T A .\nThat means:\n\u2003\u2022 (6,9) is our head (\u201c2\u201d)\n\u2003\u2022 (7,9) is part of our body (\u201cT\u201d)\n\u2003\u2022 (8,9) is an apple (\u201cA\u201d)\n\nOur enemy snake (snake #1) is at (7,7), and the other apples are at (5,7), (2,6), (6,2), and (9,1).\n\nFrom our head at (6,9) our possible moves are:\n\u2003\u2022 UP \u2192 (6,10). That\u2019s off the board (since the board goes from 0 to 9), so we can\u2019t go UP.\n\u2003\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (7,9). That square is occupied by our own body (\u201cT\u201d), and moving there would mean death.\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT \u2192 (5,9). Row 9, column 5 is \u201c.\u201d (empty), so it\u2019s safe.\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (6,8). Row 8 (which reads \u201c. . . . . . . T . .\u201d) tells us that (6,8) is \u201c.\u201d (empty) as well.\n\nSo our only safe choices are LEFT and DOWN. Now, which should we choose?\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\u2003\u2013 The apple at (8,9) is to our right, but we cannot reach it because our body (the segment at (7,9)) blocks that direction.\n\u2003\u2013 The apple at (5,7) is down and to the left of our head. Whether we go LEFT first or DOWN first, we can later move to (5,7). For example:\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb If we move LEFT to (5,9), on the following turn we could move DOWN to (5,8) and then DOWN again to (5,7) to grab the apple.\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb Alternatively, if we move DOWN to (6,8), we could later move LEFT toward (5,7).\n\u2003\nBetween the two, moving LEFT first (to (5,9)) seems appealing because it moves us laterally toward the apple at (5,7) while keeping our head high on the board. This also helps avoid any accidental run\u2010in with the enemy snake located lower at (7,7). \n\nNext turn I\u2019ll plan to head downward (or adjust as needed) so that I can reach the apple at (5,7) safely. \n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
