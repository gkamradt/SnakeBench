No near-term advantages for apple collection. \n   \n2. **RIGHT** to (7, 8): Moves towards the apple at (7, 2) while maintaining distance from enemy snake.\n   \n3. **LEFT** to (5, 8): Moves me towards the middle of the board, but still requires multiple turns to access gems.

To get there, I could go RIGHT then DOWN.\nAnother apple is at (5, 3). To get there, I could go RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT.\nAnother apple is at (0, 4). To get there, I could go LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN.\nAnother apple is at (1, 1). To get there, I could go LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT.\nAnother apple is at (7, 2). To get there, I could go RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6, 8), so it is not an immediate threat.\n\nLet's consider going to the apple at (4, 5).\nI will go RIGHT to (4, 6).\n\nNext turn strategy: Re-evaluate apple positions and enemy snake positions. Prioritize apples that are closer and avoid collisions.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
