This creates a zone of threat directly downward, as my nearest vertical movement would take me towards their territory.\n\n### Possible Moves from (3, 1):\n1. **UP to (3, 2)** - This is an open position.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 0)** - This is also open.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 1)** - This would take me back to my previous position, which is not an ideal option.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 1)** - This is an open position as well, potentially moving towards the enemy snake's territory, which could be risky depending on future moves.\n\n### Appearances of Apples:\n- The closest apple remains at **(1, 3)**. While a longer-term goal should be to reach it, I need to remain cautious about proximity to the enemy snake.\n\n### Evaluating Options:\n1. **UP to (3, 2)**: Moving up keeps me clear and away from threats while potentially giving room for future moves or different strategies.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 0)**: This is safe and could set me up for moving left on the next turn towards (1, 3), still maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 1)**: This is not an option as I\u2019m just backtracking.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 1)**: This may look appealing, but considering the enemy snake\u2019s presence and future potential moves, it could lead me into a more dangerous situation.\n\n### Strategy for Next Move:\nMoving **UP to (3, 2)** seems the most strategic for maintaining safety and staying flexible for future moves. This will position me safely upward, giving me options for further moves without immediately threatening my survival.\n\nNext move decided: **UP**."

However, **RIGHT to (4, 2)** also appears promising as it allows maintaining distance from the enemy snake's territory.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\nI want to avoid going too close to the enemy snake while finding a way to position myself to either reach nearby apples or fortify my position in the center to control the board.\n\nNext move decided: **UP**."
