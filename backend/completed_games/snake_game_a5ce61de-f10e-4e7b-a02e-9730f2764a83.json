Going to LEFT seems risky due to potential collision but could give an opportunity to grow if managed correctly. Moving RIGHT might be a good balance between risk and reward, keeping me safe from immediate threats while also allowing for future opportunity to approach the other apples. Going DOWN is clearly out of the question.\n\nSo, given that maintaining stability is important to stay in the game and strategize the next move, shifting to the right seems like a sensible and safe action at this point.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
