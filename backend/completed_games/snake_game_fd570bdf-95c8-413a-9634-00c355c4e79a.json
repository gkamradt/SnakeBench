            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me take a look at the board and my current situation. \n\nSo, the board is 10x10, and my snake is at (6,5). There are several apples on the board: at (7,7), (2,9), (9,2), (2,6), and (9,0). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. I also have an enemy snake, number 2, at (1,3), but it doesn't have a body listed, so maybe it's just the head right now. \n\nFirst, I should assess where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (6,5), which is near the middle of the board. Looking at the apples, the closest ones seem to be at (2,6) and (7,7). The apple at (2,6) is two units to the left and one up from me, so that's a bit closer. The apple at (7,7) is to the right and up, which might be a longer path. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the position of the other snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (1,3), which is way to the left and down from me. It doesn't seem like an immediate threat unless I move towards that area, which I'm not planning to right now. \n\nDo I have any other obstacles? The board shows my current position and the apples, but I don't see any walls nearby except the edges, which are at 0 and 9 on both axes. I need to make sure I don't go beyond those because that would cause me to die.\n\nSo, my immediate options are to move in one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- Moving up: From (6,5) to (6,6). That would get me closer to the apple at (2,6), which is still two to the left. It's also a step towards (7,7), but that's further. \n\n- Moving right: From (6,5) to (7,5). This moves me towards the middle and closer to (7,7), but it's two steps up from there. Also, I don't see any immediate apples to the right except the ones I already know about.\n\n- Moving left: From (6,5) to (5,5). This doesn't seem helpful because there's an apple at (2,6), but that's still to the left and up. Moving left would take me away from the apples at (7,7) and (2,6) a bit more. \n\n- Moving down: From (6,5) to (6,4). That would take me further away from both nearby apples. Also, moving down towards (6,0) but there's an apple at (9,0), which is far to the right.\n\nSo, the best moves seem to be either moving up or right. Moving up gets me closer to (2,6) and (7,7), while moving right gets me closer to (7,7). However, moving right directly might not be the shortest path to either apple. \n\nLooking at the apple at (2,6), which is at the same y-level as (6,5) but to the left by 4 units. So, to get there, I can move left four times and up once. But moving directly left might take me away from the other apples. On the other hand, moving up first might position me better to reach the apple at (2,6) after moving left, or alternatively, the apple at (7,7) after moving right.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (7,5) and then up to (7,7) would require two moves: RIGHT then RIGHT again to get to (7,5), then UP twice. So, that's a total of four moves. Whereas, moving up to (6,6) and then left four times would also take four moves to reach (2,6). So, both apples are about four moves away. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a more efficient path. For instance, if I go left a bit, I might get closer to (2,6), but (2,6) is also two units down from (2,9), but that's a different apple. Wait, no, (2,6) is its own apple.\n\nI should also consider potential threats. The enemy snake is at (1,3). If I move left towards (2,6), I might come closer to the enemy. The distance between me and the enemy is (6,5) to (1,3) is 5 units left and 2 units down. That's a significant distance, so probably not a threat in the next few moves unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I'm heading towards (6,6), which is closer to (2,6) and (7,7). Let me visualize the board. \n\nLooking at the board, my position is at (6,5). If I move up to (6,6), the next move could be left to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on. That would take me closer to (2,6). Alternatively, from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) would get me closer to (7,7), which is just one more up. \n\nWait, but my current position is at (6,5), so moving up to (6,6) puts me one step closer to both (2,6) and (7,7). From there, I have to decide whether to go left or right.\n\nBut since the apple at (2,6) is to the left and same y-level as (6,6) but at x=2, which is 4 units left, and the apple at (7,7) is 1 unit right and 1 unit up from (6,6). So, which is closer? The (7,7) is closer in terms of steps: from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) and then up to (7,7) is two steps. Whereas, getting to (2,6) would require moving left four times. So, (7,7) is closer, but it's also at a higher y-coordinate, so I need to go up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can head towards (7,7) first because it's closer. So, from (6,5), moving up to (6,6), then right to (7,6), and then up to (7,7). That would be three moves. But wait, what's the current position of other snakes? The enemy is at (1,3), so not in the path. Also, I need to make sure I don't hit myself or the walls. Since my snake is just the head right now, I don't have a body to worry about yet.\n\nWait, the rules say if I run into myself, I die. So, I need to make sure I don't go backwards, but since I'm moving forward, that's not an issue yet.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move towards (7,7), I might be able to get there before the enemy does. But I don't know where the enemy is moving. Since this is the first move, I don't have any previous information on enemy movement.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (2,6) might be safer because it's farther from the enemy. But I think the enemy is far away, so the immediate threat is low.\n\nSo, perhaps the best strategy is to move towards the nearest apple, which is either (2,6) or (7,7). Since (7,7) is closer in terms of steps, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nSo, first move: UP to (6,6). Then, RIGHT to (7,6), and then UP to (7,7). That's three moves, and I can collect that apple. After that, I can decide the next move based on the new apple positions.\n\nBut wait, in the board state, there's an apple at (7,7) and (2,6). So, moving towards (7,7) is a better option because it's closer.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be UP. That way, I start moving towards the apple at (7,7) and also keep the option open to go towards (2,6) if needed.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first to (7,5), I'm closer to (7,7) by two steps: right and up. So, moving RIGHT might be better as the first step.\n\nWait, from (6,5), moving RIGHT to (7,5) is one step. Then, from there, moving UP to (7,6) and then to (7,7). So, that's three moves. Whereas, moving UP first to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7) is also three moves. So, both options take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it gets me closer to the (7,7) apple more directly. However, moving UP first might give me more flexibility because I can choose to go either left or right from (6,6).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's a more straightforward path to the apple.\n\nBut wait, is there any obstacle between me and (7,7)? Let me check the board. At (7,5), (7,6), and (7,7), there are no other snakes except the apples, so it's clear. So moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe.\n\nSo, perhaps moving RIGHT is the better first move because it directly approaches the apple at (7,7). \n\nBut another thought: moving UP first might allow me to position myself to go either left or right, so I can decide after that move which apple to chase. But in this case, since (7,7) is closer, moving RIGHT first makes sense.\n\nSo, I think my next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo move towards the closest apple at (7,7), I'll head right first.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The apple at (7,7) is two units up from my current position, so it's closer. The apple at (2,6) is five units to the left and one up, which is a bit further. Since I'm already moving RIGHT towards (7,5), I can continue moving up towards (7,7). \n\nWait, I just moved RIGHT, so now I'm at (7,5). To get to (7,7), I need to go UP two times. That would make me reach the apple in two moves. So, the next move should be UP to (7,6), and then UP again to (7,7).\n\nBut let me check if there are any obstacles between me and (7,7). The board shows an apple at (7,7), so that's clear. I don't see any other snakes in that path, so it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving LEFT towards (2,6), but that would take me away from the closer apple. So, it's better to collect the closer apple first.\n\nSo, my next move should be UP to (7,6), getting closer to (7,7). After that, another UP move would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but I also have the apple at (2,6). If I go for (7,7) first, maybe I can then go for (2,6) next. But it's also possible that another snake could reach it first, but since the enemy is at (1,4), I don't think it's a threat.\n\nAnother consideration: collecting the apple at (7,7) will make my snake longer, which could help me block the enemy or have more options in future moves.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (7,6) and then UP again to (7,7) to collect the apple.\n\nBut wait, didn't I just move RIGHT to (7,5)? Yes, so my next move should be UP to (7,6), and then UP again.\n\nI think that's the best move. So, my next direction is UP.\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me take a look at the board and my current situation. \n\nSo, the board is 10x10, and my snake is at (6,5). There are several apples on the board: at (7,7), (2,9), (9,2), (2,6), and (9,0). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. I also have an enemy snake, number 2, at (1,3), but it doesn't have a body listed, so maybe it's just the head right now. \n\nFirst, I should assess where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (6,5), which is near the middle of the board. Looking at the apples, the closest ones seem to be at (2,6) and (7,7). The apple at (2,6) is two units to the left and one up from me, so that's a bit closer. The apple at (7,7) is to the right and up, which might be a longer path. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the position of the other snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (1,3), which is way to the left and down from me. It doesn't seem like an immediate threat unless I move towards that area, which I'm not planning to right now. \n\nDo I have any other obstacles? The board shows my current position and the apples, but I don't see any walls nearby except the edges, which are at 0 and 9 on both axes. I need to make sure I don't go beyond those because that would cause me to die.\n\nSo, my immediate options are to move in one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- Moving up: From (6,5) to (6,6). That would get me closer to the apple at (2,6), which is still two to the left. It's also a step towards (7,7), but that's further. \n\n- Moving right: From (6,5) to (7,5). This moves me towards the middle and closer to (7,7), but it's two steps up from there. Also, I don't see any immediate apples to the right except the ones I already know about.\n\n- Moving left: From (6,5) to (5,5). This doesn't seem helpful because there's an apple at (2,6), but that's still to the left and up. Moving left would take me away from the apples at (7,7) and (2,6) a bit more. \n\n- Moving down: From (6,5) to (6,4). That would take me further away from both nearby apples. Also, moving down towards (6,0) but there's an apple at (9,0), which is far to the right.\n\nSo, the best moves seem to be either moving up or right. Moving up gets me closer to (2,6) and (7,7), while moving right gets me closer to (7,7). However, moving right directly might not be the shortest path to either apple. \n\nLooking at the apple at (2,6), which is at the same y-level as (6,5) but to the left by 4 units. So, to get there, I can move left four times and up once. But moving directly left might take me away from the other apples. On the other hand, moving up first might position me better to reach the apple at (2,6) after moving left, or alternatively, the apple at (7,7) after moving right.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (7,5) and then up to (7,7) would require two moves: RIGHT then RIGHT again to get to (7,5), then UP twice. So, that's a total of four moves. Whereas, moving up to (6,6) and then left four times would also take four moves to reach (2,6). So, both apples are about four moves away. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a more efficient path. For instance, if I go left a bit, I might get closer to (2,6), but (2,6) is also two units down from (2,9), but that's a different apple. Wait, no, (2,6) is its own apple.\n\nI should also consider potential threats. The enemy snake is at (1,3). If I move left towards (2,6), I might come closer to the enemy. The distance between me and the enemy is (6,5) to (1,3) is 5 units left and 2 units down. That's a significant distance, so probably not a threat in the next few moves unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I'm heading towards (6,6), which is closer to (2,6) and (7,7). Let me visualize the board. \n\nLooking at the board, my position is at (6,5). If I move up to (6,6), the next move could be left to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on. That would take me closer to (2,6). Alternatively, from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) would get me closer to (7,7), which is just one more up. \n\nWait, but my current position is at (6,5), so moving up to (6,6) puts me one step closer to both (2,6) and (7,7). From there, I have to decide whether to go left or right.\n\nBut since the apple at (2,6) is to the left and same y-level as (6,6) but at x=2, which is 4 units left, and the apple at (7,7) is 1 unit right and 1 unit up from (6,6). So, which is closer? The (7,7) is closer in terms of steps: from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) and then up to (7,7) is two steps. Whereas, getting to (2,6) would require moving left four times. So, (7,7) is closer, but it's also at a higher y-coordinate, so I need to go up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can head towards (7,7) first because it's closer. So, from (6,5), moving up to (6,6), then right to (7,6), and then up to (7,7). That would be three moves. But wait, what's the current position of other snakes? The enemy is at (1,3), so not in the path. Also, I need to make sure I don't hit myself or the walls. Since my snake is just the head right now, I don't have a body to worry about yet.\n\nWait, the rules say if I run into myself, I die. So, I need to make sure I don't go backwards, but since I'm moving forward, that's not an issue yet.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move towards (7,7), I might be able to get there before the enemy does. But I don't know where the enemy is moving. Since this is the first move, I don't have any previous information on enemy movement.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (2,6) might be safer because it's farther from the enemy. But I think the enemy is far away, so the immediate threat is low.\n\nSo, perhaps the best strategy is to move towards the nearest apple, which is either (2,6) or (7,7). Since (7,7) is closer in terms of steps, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nSo, first move: UP to (6,6). Then, RIGHT to (7,6), and then UP to (7,7). That's three moves, and I can collect that apple. After that, I can decide the next move based on the new apple positions.\n\nBut wait, in the board state, there's an apple at (7,7) and (2,6). So, moving towards (7,7) is a better option because it's closer.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be UP. That way, I start moving towards the apple at (7,7) and also keep the option open to go towards (2,6) if needed.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first to (7,5), I'm closer to (7,7) by two steps: right and up. So, moving RIGHT might be better as the first step.\n\nWait, from (6,5), moving RIGHT to (7,5) is one step. Then, from there, moving UP to (7,6) and then to (7,7). So, that's three moves. Whereas, moving UP first to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7) is also three moves. So, both options take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it gets me closer to the (7,7) apple more directly. However, moving UP first might give me more flexibility because I can choose to go either left or right from (6,6).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's a more straightforward path to the apple.\n\nBut wait, is there any obstacle between me and (7,7)? Let me check the board. At (7,5), (7,6), and (7,7), there are no other snakes except the apples, so it's clear. So moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe.\n\nSo, perhaps moving RIGHT is the better first move because it directly approaches the apple at (7,7). \n\nBut another thought: moving UP first might allow me to position myself to go either left or right, so I can decide after that move which apple to chase. But in this case, since (7,7) is closer, moving RIGHT first makes sense.\n\nSo, I think my next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo move towards the closest apple at (7,7), I'll head right first.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

So, both apples are about four moves away. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a more efficient path. For instance, if I go left a bit, I might get closer to (2,6), but (2,6) is also two units down from (2,9), but that's a different apple. Wait, no, (2,6) is its own apple.\n\nI should also consider potential threats. The enemy snake is at (1,3). If I move left towards (2,6), I might come closer to the enemy. The distance between me and the enemy is (6,5) to (1,3) is 5 units left and 2 units down. That's a significant distance, so probably not a threat in the next few moves unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I'm heading towards (6,6), which is closer to (2,6) and (7,7). Let me visualize the board. \n\nLooking at the board, my position is at (6,5). If I move up to (6,6), the next move could be left to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on. That would take me closer to (2,6). Alternatively, from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) would get me closer to (7,7), which is just one more up. \n\nWait, but my current position is at (6,5), so moving up to (6,6) puts me one step closer to both (2,6) and (7,7). From there, I have to decide whether to go left or right.\n\nBut since the apple at (2,6) is to the left and same y-level as (6,6) but at x=2, which is 4 units left, and the apple at (7,7) is 1 unit right and 1 unit up from (6,6). So, which is closer? The (7,7) is closer in terms of steps: from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) and then up to (7,7) is two steps. Whereas, getting to (2,6) would require moving left four times. So, (7,7) is closer, but it's also at a higher y-coordinate, so I need to go up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can head towards (7,7) first because it's closer. So, from (6,5), moving up to (6,6), then right to (7,6), and then up to (7,7). That would be three moves. But wait, what's the current position of other snakes? The enemy is at (1,3), so not in the path. Also, I need to make sure I don't hit myself or the walls. Since my snake is just the head right now, I don't have a body to worry about yet.\n\nWait, the rules say if I run into myself, I die. So, I need to make sure I don't go backwards, but since I'm moving forward, that's not an issue yet.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move towards (7,7), I might be able to get there before the enemy does. But I don't know where the enemy is moving. Since this is the first move, I don't have any previous information on enemy movement.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (2,6) might be safer because it's farther from the enemy. But I think the enemy is far away, so the immediate threat is low.\n\nSo, perhaps the best strategy is to move towards the nearest apple, which is either (2,6) or (7,7). Since (7,7) is closer in terms of steps, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nSo, first move: UP to (6,6). Then, RIGHT to (7,6), and then UP to (7,7). That's three moves, and I can collect that apple. After that, I can decide the next move based on the new apple positions.\n\nBut wait, in the board state, there's an apple at (7,7) and (2,6). So, moving towards (7,7) is a better option because it's closer.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be UP. That way, I start moving towards the apple at (7,7) and also keep the option open to go towards (2,6) if needed.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first to (7,5), I'm closer to (7,7) by two steps: right and up. So, moving RIGHT might be better as the first step.\n\nWait, from (6,5), moving RIGHT to (7,5) is one step. Then, from there, moving UP to (7,6) and then to (7,7). So, that's three moves. Whereas, moving UP first to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7) is also three moves. So, both options take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it gets me closer to the (7,7) apple more directly. However, moving UP first might give me more flexibility because I can choose to go either left or right from (6,6).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's a more straightforward path to the apple.\n\nBut wait, is there any obstacle between me and (7,7)? Let me check the board. At (7,5), (7,6), and (7,7), there are no other snakes except the apples, so it's clear. So moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe.\n\nSo, perhaps moving RIGHT is the better first move because it directly approaches the apple at (7,7). \n\nBut another thought: moving UP first might allow me to position myself to go either left or right, so I can decide after that move which apple to chase. But in this case, since (7,7) is closer, moving RIGHT first makes sense.\n\nSo, I think my next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo move towards the closest apple at (7,7), I'll head right first.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me take a look at the board and my current situation. \n\nSo, the board is 10x10, and my snake is at (6,5). There are several apples on the board: at (7,7), (2,9), (9,2), (2,6), and (9,0). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. I also have an enemy snake, number 2, at (1,3), but it doesn't have a body listed, so maybe it's just the head right now. \n\nFirst, I should assess where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (6,5), which is near the middle of the board. Looking at the apples, the closest ones seem to be at (2,6) and (7,7). The apple at (2,6) is two units to the left and one up from me, so that's a bit closer. The apple at (7,7) is to the right and up, which might be a longer path. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the position of the other snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (1,3), which is way to the left and down from me. It doesn't seem like an immediate threat unless I move towards that area, which I'm not planning to right now. \n\nDo I have any other obstacles? The board shows my current position and the apples, but I don't see any walls nearby except the edges, which are at 0 and 9 on both axes. I need to make sure I don't go beyond those because that would cause me to die.\n\nSo, my immediate options are to move in one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- Moving up: From (6,5) to (6,6). That would get me closer to the apple at (2,6), which is still two to the left. It's also a step towards (7,7), but that's further. \n\n- Moving right: From (6,5) to (7,5). This moves me towards the middle and closer to (7,7), but it's two steps up from there. Also, I don't see any immediate apples to the right except the ones I already know about.\n\n- Moving left: From (6,5) to (5,5). This doesn't seem helpful because there's an apple at (2,6), but that's still to the left and up. Moving left would take me away from the apples at (7,7) and (2,6) a bit more. \n\n- Moving down: From (6,5) to (6,4). That would take me further away from both nearby apples. Also, moving down towards (6,0) but there's an apple at (9,0), which is far to the right.\n\nSo, the best moves seem to be either moving up or right. Moving up gets me closer to (2,6) and (7,7), while moving right gets me closer to (7,7). However, moving right directly might not be the shortest path to either apple. \n\nLooking at the apple at (2,6), which is at the same y-level as (6,5) but to the left by 4 units. So, to get there, I can move left four times and up once. But moving directly left might take me away from the other apples. On the other hand, moving up first might position me better to reach the apple at (2,6) after moving left, or alternatively, the apple at (7,7) after moving right.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (7,5) and then up to (7,7) would require two moves: RIGHT then RIGHT again to get to (7,5), then UP twice. So, that's a total of four moves. Whereas, moving up to (6,6) and then left four times would also take four moves to reach (2,6).

Wait, no, (2,6) is its own apple.\n\nI should also consider potential threats. The enemy snake is at (1,3). If I move left towards (2,6), I might come closer to the enemy. The distance between me and the enemy is (6,5) to (1,3) is 5 units left and 2 units down. That's a significant distance, so probably not a threat in the next few moves unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I'm heading towards (6,6), which is closer to (2,6) and (7,7). Let me visualize the board. \n\nLooking at the board, my position is at (6,5). If I move up to (6,6), the next move could be left to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on. That would take me closer to (2,6). Alternatively, from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) would get me closer to (7,7), which is just one more up. \n\nWait, but my current position is at (6,5), so moving up to (6,6) puts me one step closer to both (2,6) and (7,7).

My last move was RIGHT, so I'm moving in that direction. \n\nFirst, I should check the board state again. My snake is at (7,5), and the closest apples seem to be at (7,7) and (2,6). The enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (1,4), which is pretty far away, so I don't think it's an immediate threat.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. The apple at (7,7) is two units up from my current position, so it's closer. The apple at (2,6) is five units to the left and one up, which is a bit further. Since I'm already moving RIGHT towards (7,5), I can continue moving up towards (7,7). \n\nWait, I just moved RIGHT, so now I'm at (7,5). To get to (7,7), I need to go UP two times.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me take a look at the board and my current situation. \n\nSo, the board is 10x10, and my snake is at (6,5). There are several apples on the board: at (7,7), (2,9), (9,2), (2,6), and (9,0). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. I also have an enemy snake, number 2, at (1,3), but it doesn't have a body listed, so maybe it's just the head right now. \n\nFirst, I should assess where I am and where the apples are. I'm at (6,5), which is near the middle of the board. Looking at the apples, the closest ones seem to be at (2,6) and (7,7). The apple at (2,6) is two units to the left and one up from me, so that's a bit closer. The apple at (7,7) is to the right and up, which might be a longer path. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the position of the other snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (1,3), which is way to the left and down from me. It doesn't seem like an immediate threat unless I move towards that area, which I'm not planning to right now. \n\nDo I have any other obstacles? The board shows my current position and the apples, but I don't see any walls nearby except the edges, which are at 0 and 9 on both axes. I need to make sure I don't go beyond those because that would cause me to die.\n\nSo, my immediate options are to move in one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- Moving up: From (6,5) to (6,6). That would get me closer to the apple at (2,6), which is still two to the left. It's also a step towards (7,7), but that's further. \n\n- Moving right: From (6,5) to (7,5). This moves me towards the middle and closer to (7,7), but it's two steps up from there. Also, I don't see any immediate apples to the right except the ones I already know about.\n\n- Moving left: From (6,5) to (5,5). This doesn't seem helpful because there's an apple at (2,6), but that's still to the left and up. Moving left would take me away from the apples at (7,7) and (2,6) a bit more. \n\n- Moving down: From (6,5) to (6,4). That would take me further away from both nearby apples. Also, moving down towards (6,0) but there's an apple at (9,0), which is far to the right.\n\nSo, the best moves seem to be either moving up or right. Moving up gets me closer to (2,6) and (7,7), while moving right gets me closer to (7,7). However, moving right directly might not be the shortest path to either apple. \n\nLooking at the apple at (2,6), which is at the same y-level as (6,5) but to the left by 4 units. So, to get there, I can move left four times and up once. But moving directly left might take me away from the other apples. On the other hand, moving up first might position me better to reach the apple at (2,6) after moving left, or alternatively, the apple at (7,7) after moving right.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (7,5) and then up to (7,7) would require two moves: RIGHT then RIGHT again to get to (7,5), then UP twice. So, that's a total of four moves. Whereas, moving up to (6,6) and then left four times would also take four moves to reach (2,6). So, both apples are about four moves away. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a more efficient path. For instance, if I go left a bit, I might get closer to (2,6), but (2,6) is also two units down from (2,9), but that's a different apple. Wait, no, (2,6) is its own apple.\n\nI should also consider potential threats. The enemy snake is at (1,3). If I move left towards (2,6), I might come closer to the enemy. The distance between me and the enemy is (6,5) to (1,3) is 5 units left and 2 units down. That's a significant distance, so probably not a threat in the next few moves unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I'm heading towards (6,6), which is closer to (2,6) and (7,7). Let me visualize the board. \n\nLooking at the board, my position is at (6,5). If I move up to (6,6), the next move could be left to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on. That would take me closer to (2,6). Alternatively, from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) would get me closer to (7,7), which is just one more up. \n\nWait, but my current position is at (6,5), so moving up to (6,6) puts me one step closer to both (2,6) and (7,7). From there, I have to decide whether to go left or right.\n\nBut since the apple at (2,6) is to the left and same y-level as (6,6) but at x=2, which is 4 units left, and the apple at (7,7) is 1 unit right and 1 unit up from (6,6). So, which is closer? The (7,7) is closer in terms of steps: from (6,6), moving right to (7,6) and then up to (7,7) is two steps. Whereas, getting to (2,6) would require moving left four times. So, (7,7) is closer, but it's also at a higher y-coordinate, so I need to go up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can head towards (7,7) first because it's closer. So, from (6,5), moving up to (6,6), then right to (7,6), and then up to (7,7). That would be three moves. But wait, what's the current position of other snakes? The enemy is at (1,3), so not in the path. Also, I need to make sure I don't hit myself or the walls. Since my snake is just the head right now, I don't have a body to worry about yet.\n\nWait, the rules say if I run into myself, I die. So, I need to make sure I don't go backwards, but since I'm moving forward, that's not an issue yet.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move towards (7,7), I might be able to get there before the enemy does. But I don't know where the enemy is moving. Since this is the first move, I don't have any previous information on enemy movement.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (2,6) might be safer because it's farther from the enemy. But I think the enemy is far away, so the immediate threat is low.\n\nSo, perhaps the best strategy is to move towards the nearest apple, which is either (2,6) or (7,7). Since (7,7) is closer in terms of steps, maybe I should go for that first.\n\nSo, first move: UP to (6,6). Then, RIGHT to (7,6), and then UP to (7,7). That's three moves, and I can collect that apple. After that, I can decide the next move based on the new apple positions.\n\nBut wait, in the board state, there's an apple at (7,7) and (2,6). So, moving towards (7,7) is a better option because it's closer.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be UP. That way, I start moving towards the apple at (7,7) and also keep the option open to go towards (2,6) if needed.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first to (7,5), I'm closer to (7,7) by two steps: right and up. So, moving RIGHT might be better as the first step.\n\nWait, from (6,5), moving RIGHT to (7,5) is one step. Then, from there, moving UP to (7,6) and then to (7,7). So, that's three moves. Whereas, moving UP first to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7) is also three moves. So, both options take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it gets me closer to the (7,7) apple more directly. However, moving UP first might give me more flexibility because I can choose to go either left or right from (6,6).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's a more straightforward path to the apple.\n\nBut wait, is there any obstacle between me and (7,7)? Let me check the board. At (7,5), (7,6), and (7,7), there are no other snakes except the apples, so it's clear. So moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe.\n\nSo, perhaps moving RIGHT is the better first move because it directly approaches the apple at (7,7). \n\nBut another thought: moving UP first might allow me to position myself to go either left or right, so I can decide after that move which apple to chase. But in this case, since (7,7) is closer, moving RIGHT first makes sense.\n\nSo, I think my next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo move towards the closest apple at (7,7), I'll head right first.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

But it's also possible that another snake could reach it first, but since the enemy is at (1,4), I don't think it's a threat.\n\nAnother consideration: collecting the apple at (7,7) will make my snake longer, which could help me block the enemy or have more options in future moves.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (7,6) and then UP again to (7,7) to collect the apple.\n\nBut wait, didn't I just move RIGHT to (7,5)? Yes, so my next move should be UP to (7,6), and then UP again.\n\nI think that's the best move. So, my next direction is UP.\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"
