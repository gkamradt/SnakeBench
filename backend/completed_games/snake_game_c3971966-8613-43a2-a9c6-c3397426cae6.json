            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, ID 1, is currently at (8,1). There are several apples on the board: at (7,2), (2,7), (7,6), (9,6), and (1,1). My last move was 'None,' so this is the first move I'm making.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, Snake #2 is at (2,8), and it doesn't have any body segments listed, so it's probably just the head. My main goal is to collect as many apples as possible to grow and get points without dying.\n\nI need to decide which direction to go next. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let me visualize the board:\n\n- My position is (8,1). So, x=8, y=1.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (7,2): That's to my left (x decreases from 8 to 7) and up (y increases from 1 to 2). So if I go LEFT once, I'll be at (7,1), and then UP to (7,2), which is where an apple is.\n\n- (1,1): That's far to the left. From (8,1), going LEFT seven times would get me there, but that's probably too far and I might run into something or another snake.\n\n- (2,7): That's way up. From (8,1), going up 6 times and left 6 times, but again, a long path.\n\n- (7,6): To the left once to (7,1), then up 5 times. Hmm, same as (7,2) but further up.\n\n- (9,6): To the right once to (9,1), then up 5 times. That's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apples at (7,2) and (1,1) are the closest. Since I'm at (8,1), moving LEFT to (7,1) gets me closer to both (7,2) and (1,1). From (7,1), I can decide whether to go up or continue left.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT from (8,1) would take me to (7,1), which is adjacent to the apple at (7,2). So maybe if I move LEFT, then I can check if the next move should be UP to grab that apple.\n\nBut I also need to check if there's any danger of colliding with myself or other snakes. My snake only has the head at (8,1), so moving LEFT to (7,1) shouldn't cause a self-collision because I don't have any body behind yet. Enemy snake #2 is at (2,8), which is far away, so no immediate threat from that.\n\nAdditionally, moving LEFT to (7,1) keeps me in a safe position without hitting the wall. The wall boundaries are from 0 to 9, so moving LEFT from x=8 is fine. If I were at x=0, moving LEFT would be invalid, but that's not the case here.\n\nNow, let me think about the alternative: what if I move UP instead? From (8,1), moving UP would take me to (8,2). There's no apple there. But from (8,2), I could then move LEFT to (7,2), which is an apple. So that would take two moves, but maybe I can do that.\n\nBut since I can only move one step at a time, my next move should be the first step towards the nearest apple. Moving LEFT to (7,1) is one step towards both (7,2) and (1,1). Alternatively, moving RIGHT from (8,1) would take me to (9,1). From there, moving UP to (9,2), (9,3), etc., towards (9,6), which is an apple. But that's six steps away, which is longer than moving to (7,2) which is two steps away via LEFT and then UP.\n\nSo the most efficient path is to go LEFT to (7,1), then next turn go UP to (7,2) to eat the apple. That seems like the best move because it's the closest apple and I can reach it in two moves.\n\nIs there any risk in moving LEFT? Let me check the positions around (7,1). Are there any other snakes or walls? The board shows that (7,1) is empty except for my snake's next position. The enemy snake is at (2,8), which is nowhere near. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I go DOWN from (8,1), that would take me to (8,0), which is the bottom row. There's no apple there and that might corner me if I go too far down, so I don't think that's a good idea.\n\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT to (9,1) might be an option, but as I thought earlier, the apple at (9,6) is too far, and I have a closer apple at (7,2).\n\nSo, the best move is to go LEFT to (7,1). After that, I can go UP to collect the apple at (7,2) in the next move. This way, I efficiently collect a nearby apple without risking collision.\n\nI should make sure not to go backwards into myself, but since I'm moving LEFT for the first time, there's no body behind me yet, so that's safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I collect the apple at (7,2), I'll grow, which means my next move after that will have to be careful not to hit my own body. But for now, moving LEFT is the first step towards that.\n\nSo, my next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points, I should move towards the nearest apple. The closest one is at (7,2). Moving LEFT to (7,1) gets me closer, and then I can go UP next turn to collect it.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I'd like to get closer to some of these apples to increase my chances of getting them.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to get closer to the apple at (2, 7), which is relatively close to my current position.
