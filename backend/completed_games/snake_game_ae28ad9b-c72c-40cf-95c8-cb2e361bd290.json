            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there. That would give me a point and let me grow.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (8,6), which is to the right of my current position.

Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7). That way, I can avoid the enemy and get the apple more quickly.\n\nWait, but when I move DOWN, I go from (4,9) to (4,8). Is that the right move? Let me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top, so moving DOWN decreases the Y-coordinate. Yes, from (4,9), DOWN would take me to (4,8), then to (4,7), and so on.\n\nSo, moving DOWN seems like a good first step to head towards the apple at (1,7). I can then continue adjusting my direction as needed once I'm closer.\n\nI should also be cautious not to go in circles or get stuck. Maybe after moving DOWN, I can then move LEFT towards (1,7). Let's see: (4,9) -> (4,8) -> (4,7). From there, to reach (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times, which would take me through (3,7), (2,7), (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if I go RIGHT to (5,9), I might have a longer path but could potentially reach other apples. But considering the enemy snake's position, maybe it's safer to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go DOWN to (4,8), heading towards the apple at (1,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there. That would give me a point and let me grow.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (8,6), which is to the right of my current position. To get there, I would need to go RIGHT to (5,9), then DOWN to (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), then maybe RIGHT again towards (8,6). But that path might take longer, and I might run into the enemy snake if I go near (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nAnother option is to check if there are any immediate threats nearby. Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7). That way, I can avoid the enemy and get the apple more quickly.\n\nWait, but when I move DOWN, I go from (4,9) to (4,8). Is that the right move? Let me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top, so moving DOWN decreases the Y-coordinate. Yes, from (4,9), DOWN would take me to (4,8), then to (4,7), and so on.\n\nSo, moving DOWN seems like a good first step to head towards the apple at (1,7). I can then continue adjusting my direction as needed once I'm closer.\n\nI should also be cautious not to go in circles or get stuck. Maybe after moving DOWN, I can then move LEFT towards (1,7). Let's see: (4,9) -> (4,8) -> (4,7). From there, to reach (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times, which would take me through (3,7), (2,7), (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if I go RIGHT to (5,9), I might have a longer path but could potentially reach other apples. But considering the enemy snake's position, maybe it's safer to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go DOWN to (4,8), heading towards the apple at (1,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm Snake ID 2, currently at position (4,8), and I'm trying to figure out my next move. The apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should assess where I am. I'm at (4,8), which is on row 8, column 4. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving DOWN would decrease my Y-coordinate, moving me closer to the bottom, and moving UP would increase it, moving me towards the top.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (1,7). Let me check the distance. To get from (4,8) to (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times (from 4 to 1 on the X-axis) and DOWN once (from 8 to 7 on the Y-axis). Alternatively, I could move DOWN first and then LEFT. That might be a good way to approach it because moving DOWN first gets me closer to the Y-coordinate of the apple.\n\nSnake #1 is at (7,5) with a body at (7,6). That's a bit far from me, but I should still be cautious. If I move towards (1,7), I don't think I'll be in danger from Snake #1 since it's on the other side of the board.\n\nLet me visualize the path. If I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that's one step. From there, I can move LEFT to (3,7), then to (2,7), and finally to (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's safe.\n\nI also notice an apple at (8,6). To reach that, I would have to move RIGHT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), but that's a longer path, and I might run into Snake #1's body at (7,6) if I'm not careful. It might not be worth the risk right now since (1,7) is closer.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5), which is even further away, so I'll ignore that for now. So, focusing on (1,7) seems like the best strategy.\n\nDo I have any other concerns? My snake is just the head at (4,8), so no body to worry about. Enemy snake's head is at (7,5), which is far enough that I don't have to worry about it in my next few moves, as long as I don't go towards that area.\n\nSo, the plan is to move DOWN to (4,7), then start moving LEFT towards (1,7). Once I reach (1,7), I'll have an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nWait, but after moving to (4,7), I should check if there's a better path. Maybe moving DOWN again to (4,6) would get me closer to some other apples, but (1,7) is still the closest. Also, moving DOWN to (4,7) doesn't seem to be blocked by anything.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving towards an apple that's a bit further but in a direction with fewer obstacles can be better. But in this case, (1,7) is the closest, and the path seems clear.\n\nI should also consider if any apples are placed in such a way that multiple snakes might go for them. But since I'm the only one I know of, I guess it's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be DOWN to (4,7), heading towards the apple at (1,7). Once there, I'll have more options, but for now, moving DOWN is the right step.\n\nAnother consideration: If I move DOWN, I'm at (4,7), which is one step away from the apple at (1,7). So, the next moves would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, which would get me there. That's three moves in total after this one, which is manageable.\n\nI think I've thought it through. Moving DOWN is the correct move to get closer to the apple without any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

This should be a more immediate concern than moving vertically since moving up or down doesn't directly contribute to getting closer to any apples at the moment.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that moving down takes you towards (9, 7) which doesn\u2019t particularly bring you closer to the closest apple efficiently or serve any strategic benefit as it merely increases the distance you\u2019ll need to cover horizontally later.\n\nYour priority should be to close in vertically (y-axis) while securing a path towards the apple, so making a move Left this turn prepares for a potentially safe downward move in the subsequent turn if the enemy snake does not move down into your intended path.\n\nMy strategy for next turn would be to assess the enemy's position after my move left and potentially continue down (twice) towards the apple if the path is clear. \n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there. That would give me a point and let me grow.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (8,6), which is to the right of my current position.

Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7). That way, I can avoid the enemy and get the apple more quickly.\n\nWait, but when I move DOWN, I go from (4,9) to (4,8). Is that the right move? Let me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top, so moving DOWN decreases the Y-coordinate. Yes, from (4,9), DOWN would take me to (4,8), then to (4,7), and so on.\n\nSo, moving DOWN seems like a good first step to head towards the apple at (1,7).

Let's see: (4,9) -> (4,8) -> (4,7). From there, to reach (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times, which would take me through (3,7), (2,7), (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if I go RIGHT to (5,9), I might have a longer path but could potentially reach other apples. But considering the enemy snake's position, maybe it's safer to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go DOWN to (4,8), heading towards the apple at (1,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should assess where I am. I'm at (4,8), which is on row 8, column 4. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving DOWN would decrease my Y-coordinate, moving me closer to the bottom, and moving UP would increase it, moving me towards the top.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (1,7). Let me check the distance. To get from (4,8) to (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times (from 4 to 1 on the X-axis) and DOWN once (from 8 to 7 on the Y-axis). Alternatively, I could move DOWN first and then LEFT. That might be a good way to approach it because moving DOWN first gets me closer to the Y-coordinate of the apple.\n\nSnake #1 is at (7,5) with a body at (7,6). That's a bit far from me, but I should still be cautious. If I move towards (1,7), I don't think I'll be in danger from Snake #1 since it's on the other side of the board.\n\nLet me visualize the path. If I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that's one step. From there, I can move LEFT to (3,7), then to (2,7), and finally to (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's safe.\n\nI also notice an apple at (8,6). To reach that, I would have to move RIGHT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), but that's a longer path, and I might run into Snake #1's body at (7,6) if I'm not careful. It might not be worth the risk right now since (1,7) is closer.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5), which is even further away, so I'll ignore that for now. So, focusing on (1,7) seems like the best strategy.\n\nDo I have any other concerns? My snake is just the head at (4,8), so no body to worry about. Enemy snake's head is at (7,5), which is far enough that I don't have to worry about it in my next few moves, as long as I don't go towards that area.\n\nSo, the plan is to move DOWN to (4,7), then start moving LEFT towards (1,7). Once I reach (1,7), I'll have an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nWait, but after moving to (4,7), I should check if there's a better path. Maybe moving DOWN again to (4,6) would get me closer to some other apples, but (1,7) is still the closest. Also, moving DOWN to (4,7) doesn't seem to be blocked by anything.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving towards an apple that's a bit further but in a direction with fewer obstacles can be better. But in this case, (1,7) is the closest, and the path seems clear.\n\nI should also consider if any apples are placed in such a way that multiple snakes might go for them. But since I'm the only one I know of, I guess it's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be DOWN to (4,7), heading towards the apple at (1,7). Once there, I'll have more options, but for now, moving DOWN is the right step.\n\nAnother consideration: If I move DOWN, I'm at (4,7), which is one step away from the apple at (1,7). So, the next moves would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, which would get me there. That's three moves in total after this one, which is manageable.\n\nI think I've thought it through. Moving DOWN is the correct move to get closer to the apple without any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

This should be a more immediate concern than moving vertically since moving up or down doesn't directly contribute to getting closer to any apples at the moment.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that moving down takes you towards (9, 7) which doesn\u2019t particularly bring you closer to the closest apple efficiently or serve any strategic benefit as it merely increases the distance you\u2019ll need to cover horizontally later.\n\nYour priority should be to close in vertically (y-axis) while securing a path towards the apple, so making a move Left this turn prepares for a potentially safe downward move in the subsequent turn if the enemy snake does not move down into your intended path.\n\nMy strategy for next turn would be to assess the enemy's position after my move left and potentially continue down (twice) towards the apple if the path is clear. \n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there. That would give me a point and let me grow.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (8,6), which is to the right of my current position. To get there, I would need to go RIGHT to (5,9), then DOWN to (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), then maybe RIGHT again towards (8,6). But that path might take longer, and I might run into the enemy snake if I go near (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nAnother option is to check if there are any immediate threats nearby. Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7). That way, I can avoid the enemy and get the apple more quickly.\n\nWait, but when I move DOWN, I go from (4,9) to (4,8). Is that the right move? Let me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top, so moving DOWN decreases the Y-coordinate. Yes, from (4,9), DOWN would take me to (4,8), then to (4,7), and so on.\n\nSo, moving DOWN seems like a good first step to head towards the apple at (1,7). I can then continue adjusting my direction as needed once I'm closer.\n\nI should also be cautious not to go in circles or get stuck. Maybe after moving DOWN, I can then move LEFT towards (1,7). Let's see: (4,9) -> (4,8) -> (4,7). From there, to reach (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times, which would take me through (3,7), (2,7), (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if I go RIGHT to (5,9), I might have a longer path but could potentially reach other apples. But considering the enemy snake's position, maybe it's safer to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go DOWN to (4,8), heading towards the apple at (1,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should assess where I am. I'm at (4,8), which is on row 8, column 4. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving DOWN would decrease my Y-coordinate, moving me closer to the bottom, and moving UP would increase it, moving me towards the top.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (1,7). Let me check the distance. To get from (4,8) to (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times (from 4 to 1 on the X-axis) and DOWN once (from 8 to 7 on the Y-axis). Alternatively, I could move DOWN first and then LEFT. That might be a good way to approach it because moving DOWN first gets me closer to the Y-coordinate of the apple.\n\nSnake #1 is at (7,5) with a body at (7,6). That's a bit far from me, but I should still be cautious. If I move towards (1,7), I don't think I'll be in danger from Snake #1 since it's on the other side of the board.\n\nLet me visualize the path. If I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that's one step. From there, I can move LEFT to (3,7), then to (2,7), and finally to (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's safe.\n\nI also notice an apple at (8,6). To reach that, I would have to move RIGHT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), but that's a longer path, and I might run into Snake #1's body at (7,6) if I'm not careful. It might not be worth the risk right now since (1,7) is closer.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5), which is even further away, so I'll ignore that for now. So, focusing on (1,7) seems like the best strategy.\n\nDo I have any other concerns? My snake is just the head at (4,8), so no body to worry about. Enemy snake's head is at (7,5), which is far enough that I don't have to worry about it in my next few moves, as long as I don't go towards that area.\n\nSo, the plan is to move DOWN to (4,7), then start moving LEFT towards (1,7). Once I reach (1,7), I'll have an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nWait, but after moving to (4,7), I should check if there's a better path. Maybe moving DOWN again to (4,6) would get me closer to some other apples, but (1,7) is still the closest. Also, moving DOWN to (4,7) doesn't seem to be blocked by anything.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving towards an apple that's a bit further but in a direction with fewer obstacles can be better. But in this case, (1,7) is the closest, and the path seems clear.\n\nI should also consider if any apples are placed in such a way that multiple snakes might go for them. But since I'm the only one I know of, I guess it's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be DOWN to (4,7), heading towards the apple at (1,7). Once there, I'll have more options, but for now, moving DOWN is the right step.\n\nAnother consideration: If I move DOWN, I'm at (4,7), which is one step away from the apple at (1,7). So, the next moves would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, which would get me there. That's three moves in total after this one, which is manageable.\n\nI think I've thought it through. Moving DOWN is the correct move to get closer to the apple without any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there.

Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7).

My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should assess where I am. I'm at (4,8), which is on row 8, column 4. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving DOWN would decrease my Y-coordinate, moving me closer to the bottom, and moving UP would increase it, moving me towards the top.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (1,7). Let me check the distance. To get from (4,8) to (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times (from 4 to 1 on the X-axis) and DOWN once (from 8 to 7 on the Y-axis). Alternatively, I could move DOWN first and then LEFT. That might be a good way to approach it because moving DOWN first gets me closer to the Y-coordinate of the apple.\n\nSnake #1 is at (7,5) with a body at (7,6). That's a bit far from me, but I should still be cautious. If I move towards (1,7), I don't think I'll be in danger from Snake #1 since it's on the other side of the board.\n\nLet me visualize the path. If I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that's one step. From there, I can move LEFT to (3,7), then to (2,7), and finally to (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's safe.\n\nI also notice an apple at (8,6). To reach that, I would have to move RIGHT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), but that's a longer path, and I might run into Snake #1's body at (7,6) if I'm not careful. It might not be worth the risk right now since (1,7) is closer.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5), which is even further away, so I'll ignore that for now. So, focusing on (1,7) seems like the best strategy.\n\nDo I have any other concerns? My snake is just the head at (4,8), so no body to worry about. Enemy snake's head is at (7,5), which is far enough that I don't have to worry about it in my next few moves, as long as I don't go towards that area.\n\nSo, the plan is to move DOWN to (4,7), then start moving LEFT towards (1,7). Once I reach (1,7), I'll have an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nWait, but after moving to (4,7), I should check if there's a better path. Maybe moving DOWN again to (4,6) would get me closer to some other apples, but (1,7) is still the closest. Also, moving DOWN to (4,7) doesn't seem to be blocked by anything.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving towards an apple that's a bit further but in a direction with fewer obstacles can be better. But in this case, (1,7) is the closest, and the path seems clear.\n\nI should also consider if any apples are placed in such a way that multiple snakes might go for them. But since I'm the only one I know of, I guess it's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be DOWN to (4,7), heading towards the apple at (1,7). Once there, I'll have more options, but for now, moving DOWN is the right step.\n\nAnother consideration: If I move DOWN, I'm at (4,7), which is one step away from the apple at (1,7). So, the next moves would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, which would get me there. That's three moves in total after this one, which is manageable.\n\nI think I've thought it through.

Since my current X is 4, I need to move LEFT three times to reach X=1. \n\nI should check if there are any immediate obstacles or enemies in my path. Snake #1 is at (7,5) with a body at (7,6), so that's far from me, at least four columns away. There are no walls or other snakes blocking my path to (1,7). \n\nI also notice there's an apple at (8,6), but that's further away and would require moving right, which would take me away from the closer apple. So, focusing on (1,7) is better.\n\nNow, moving LEFT from (4,7) would take me to (3,7), which is safe. From there, I can continue LEFT to (2,7), then to (1,7). There's no risk of hitting myself since my snake is only the head right now. After eating the apple, I'll grow, so I need to avoid moving into my own body in the future, but that's not an issue yet.\n\nIs there a quicker way? Maybe moving DOWN to (4,6) to potentially block any other path, but I don't see any enemy moves that would interfere. Plus, the apple at (1,7) is too tempting to ignore. \n\nI should also consider if any other moves might set me up for future apples. For example, moving RIGHT could take me towards the apple at (7,2), but that's six columns away, which isn't efficient. Sticking with the closest apple makes sense.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving in a certain direction can put me in a better position for future moves, even if it's a longer path now. But in this case, since (1,7) is just a few moves away and the path is clear, it's the best choice.\n\nI should make sure that moving LEFT doesn't put me in a position where I could be blocked by another snake later.

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there.

Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7). That way, I can avoid the enemy and get the apple more quickly.\n\nWait, but when I move DOWN, I go from (4,9) to (4,8). Is that the right move? Let me visualize the board.

My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should assess where I am. I'm at (4,8), which is on row 8, column 4. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving DOWN would decrease my Y-coordinate, moving me closer to the bottom, and moving UP would increase it, moving me towards the top.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (1,7). Let me check the distance. To get from (4,8) to (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times (from 4 to 1 on the X-axis) and DOWN once (from 8 to 7 on the Y-axis). Alternatively, I could move DOWN first and then LEFT. That might be a good way to approach it because moving DOWN first gets me closer to the Y-coordinate of the apple.\n\nSnake #1 is at (7,5) with a body at (7,6). That's a bit far from me, but I should still be cautious. If I move towards (1,7), I don't think I'll be in danger from Snake #1 since it's on the other side of the board.\n\nLet me visualize the path. If I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that's one step. From there, I can move LEFT to (3,7), then to (2,7), and finally to (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's safe.\n\nI also notice an apple at (8,6). To reach that, I would have to move RIGHT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), but that's a longer path, and I might run into Snake #1's body at (7,6) if I'm not careful. It might not be worth the risk right now since (1,7) is closer.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5), which is even further away, so I'll ignore that for now. So, focusing on (1,7) seems like the best strategy.\n\nDo I have any other concerns? My snake is just the head at (4,8), so no body to worry about. Enemy snake's head is at (7,5), which is far enough that I don't have to worry about it in my next few moves, as long as I don't go towards that area.\n\nSo, the plan is to move DOWN to (4,7), then start moving LEFT towards (1,7). Once I reach (1,7), I'll have an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nWait, but after moving to (4,7), I should check if there's a better path. Maybe moving DOWN again to (4,6) would get me closer to some other apples, but (1,7) is still the closest. Also, moving DOWN to (4,7) doesn't seem to be blocked by anything.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving towards an apple that's a bit further but in a direction with fewer obstacles can be better. But in this case, (1,7) is the closest, and the path seems clear.\n\nI should also consider if any apples are placed in such a way that multiple snakes might go for them. But since I'm the only one I know of, I guess it's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be DOWN to (4,7), heading towards the apple at (1,7). Once there, I'll have more options, but for now, moving DOWN is the right step.\n\nAnother consideration: If I move DOWN, I'm at (4,7), which is one step away from the apple at (1,7). So, the next moves would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, which would get me there. That's three moves in total after this one, which is manageable.\n\nI think I've thought it through.

So, I have two moves ahead of me to get to the apple. \n\nI should check if there's any obstacle between (3,7) and (1,7). Looking at the board, I don't see any other snakes or walls in that path.

Now, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, I should update my position. After eating the apple, I've grown, so my body now includes the previous positions. But for movement, I'm focusing on the head, which is now at (1,7). The other apple positions are (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (9,5). Wait, no, the initial apples were at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Oh, but I just ate the one at (1,5)? Wait, no, the apple at (1,7). Wait, in the initial state, the apples were listed as (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Oh, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the user initially said apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). So when I was at (1,7), that's not an apple. Did I eat an apple? Wait, the board state showed an apple at (1,7) in row 1, column 7, indicated by \"A\". So I did eat that apple, which was at (1,7). That's correct.\n\nNow I need to plan my next move. After eating the apple at (1,7), I should look for the next closest apple. The remaining apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Since I'm at (1,7), the closest one would be (0,2), which is two units away (X=1 to X=0, but Y=7 to Y=2 is a significant jump). Alternatively, (1,5) is two Y units below me.\n\nWait, no, (1,5) is on the same X as me, but Y=5, so that's two down from (1,7). That might be the closest. Alternatively, (0,2) is one left and five down, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, (8,6) is also an option, but that's quite far. (9,5) is also far.\n\nSo, between (1,5), (0,2), and (0,0), (1,5) is the closest. But let me see the positions:\n\n- (1,7) to (1,5): move DOWN twice.\n- (1,7) to (0,2): move LEFT once and DOWN five times.\n- (1,7) to (0,0): move LEFT once and DOWN seven times.\n- (1,7) to (8,6): move RIGHT seven times and DOWN once.\n- (1,7) to (9,5): move RIGHT eight times and DOWN two times.\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest, requiring just two DOWN moves. That seems the best option.\n\nBut wait, what about enemy snakes? Snake #1 is at (7,5) with body segments possibly in between. So if I go down to (1,5), it's along the same X=1 line. Is that path clear?\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (1,7) to (1,5) is along Y=7 to Y=5, so I have to make sure that there are no obstacles or enemy snakes in that column. From the board state provided earlier, around X=1, Y=5 is where an apple is, so it's empty except for the apple. So moving DOWN from (1,7) to (1,6) and then to (1,5) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I should check if any enemy snake is in that path. Snake #1 is at (7,5) with body at (8,2) and (7,2), so that's far away. So the path is clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (1,6), then another DOWN to (1,5) to eat that apple. So my immediate next move is DOWN.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider any possible threats or alternative paths. For example, if moving DOWN could lead me towards enemy snakes or other dangers. But given the current positions, moving DOWN is safe.\n\nAnother consideration is growing after eating the apple. Once I eat the apple at (1,5), I'll grow longer, which could potentially block my path if I'm not careful. But since I'm moving straight down, and there's nothing ahead, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, could I consider moving towards (0,2) or (0,0)? Those are further away, and maybe other snakes could get there first, but since Snake #1 is on the opposite side, it's possible, but I think it's better to go for the closer apple.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move DOWN to (1,6) next, then DOWN again to (1,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there.

Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7). That way, I can avoid the enemy and get the apple more quickly.\n\nWait, but when I move DOWN, I go from (4,9) to (4,8). Is that the right move? Let me visualize the board.

My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should assess where I am. I'm at (4,8), which is on row 8, column 4. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving DOWN would decrease my Y-coordinate, moving me closer to the bottom, and moving UP would increase it, moving me towards the top.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (1,7). Let me check the distance. To get from (4,8) to (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times (from 4 to 1 on the X-axis) and DOWN once (from 8 to 7 on the Y-axis). Alternatively, I could move DOWN first and then LEFT. That might be a good way to approach it because moving DOWN first gets me closer to the Y-coordinate of the apple.\n\nSnake #1 is at (7,5) with a body at (7,6). That's a bit far from me, but I should still be cautious. If I move towards (1,7), I don't think I'll be in danger from Snake #1 since it's on the other side of the board.\n\nLet me visualize the path. If I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that's one step. From there, I can move LEFT to (3,7), then to (2,7), and finally to (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's safe.\n\nI also notice an apple at (8,6). To reach that, I would have to move RIGHT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), but that's a longer path, and I might run into Snake #1's body at (7,6) if I'm not careful. It might not be worth the risk right now since (1,7) is closer.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5), which is even further away, so I'll ignore that for now. So, focusing on (1,7) seems like the best strategy.\n\nDo I have any other concerns? My snake is just the head at (4,8), so no body to worry about. Enemy snake's head is at (7,5), which is far enough that I don't have to worry about it in my next few moves, as long as I don't go towards that area.\n\nSo, the plan is to move DOWN to (4,7), then start moving LEFT towards (1,7). Once I reach (1,7), I'll have an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nWait, but after moving to (4,7), I should check if there's a better path. Maybe moving DOWN again to (4,6) would get me closer to some other apples, but (1,7) is still the closest. Also, moving DOWN to (4,7) doesn't seem to be blocked by anything.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving towards an apple that's a bit further but in a direction with fewer obstacles can be better. But in this case, (1,7) is the closest, and the path seems clear.\n\nI should also consider if any apples are placed in such a way that multiple snakes might go for them. But since I'm the only one I know of, I guess it's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be DOWN to (4,7), heading towards the apple at (1,7). Once there, I'll have more options, but for now, moving DOWN is the right step.\n\nAnother consideration: If I move DOWN, I'm at (4,7), which is one step away from the apple at (1,7). So, the next moves would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, which would get me there. That's three moves in total after this one, which is manageable.\n\nI think I've thought it through. Moving DOWN is the correct move to get closer to the apple without any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

There's no risk of hitting myself since my snake is only the head right now. After eating the apple, I'll grow, so I need to avoid moving into my own body in the future, but that's not an issue yet.\n\nIs there a quicker way? Maybe moving DOWN to (4,6) to potentially block any other path, but I don't see any enemy moves that would interfere. Plus, the apple at (1,7) is too tempting to ignore. \n\nI should also consider if any other moves might set me up for future apples. For example, moving RIGHT could take me towards the apple at (7,2), but that's six columns away, which isn't efficient. Sticking with the closest apple makes sense.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving in a certain direction can put me in a better position for future moves, even if it's a longer path now. But in this case, since (1,7) is just a few moves away and the path is clear, it's the best choice.\n\nI should make sure that moving LEFT doesn't put me in a position where I could be blocked by another snake later. Since Snake #1 is on the opposite side, I think it's safe.\n\nSo, the next move is clearly LEFT to get closer to the apple at (1,7). \n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have to plan the next steps, but for now, LEFT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Now, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, I should update my position. After eating the apple, I've grown, so my body now includes the previous positions. But for movement, I'm focusing on the head, which is now at (1,7). The other apple positions are (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (9,5). Wait, no, the initial apples were at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Oh, but I just ate the one at (1,5)? Wait, no, the apple at (1,7). Wait, in the initial state, the apples were listed as (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Oh, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the user initially said apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). So when I was at (1,7), that's not an apple. Did I eat an apple? Wait, the board state showed an apple at (1,7) in row 1, column 7, indicated by \"A\". So I did eat that apple, which was at (1,7). That's correct.\n\nNow I need to plan my next move. After eating the apple at (1,7), I should look for the next closest apple. The remaining apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Since I'm at (1,7), the closest one would be (0,2), which is two units away (X=1 to X=0, but Y=7 to Y=2 is a significant jump). Alternatively, (1,5) is two Y units below me.\n\nWait, no, (1,5) is on the same X as me, but Y=5, so that's two down from (1,7). That might be the closest. Alternatively, (0,2) is one left and five down, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, (8,6) is also an option, but that's quite far. (9,5) is also far.\n\nSo, between (1,5), (0,2), and (0,0), (1,5) is the closest. But let me see the positions:\n\n- (1,7) to (1,5): move DOWN twice.\n- (1,7) to (0,2): move LEFT once and DOWN five times.\n- (1,7) to (0,0): move LEFT once and DOWN seven times.\n- (1,7) to (8,6): move RIGHT seven times and DOWN once.\n- (1,7) to (9,5): move RIGHT eight times and DOWN two times.\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest, requiring just two DOWN moves. That seems the best option.\n\nBut wait, what about enemy snakes? Snake #1 is at (7,5) with body segments possibly in between. So if I go down to (1,5), it's along the same X=1 line. Is that path clear?\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (1,7) to (1,5) is along Y=7 to Y=5, so I have to make sure that there are no obstacles or enemy snakes in that column. From the board state provided earlier, around X=1, Y=5 is where an apple is, so it's empty except for the apple. So moving DOWN from (1,7) to (1,6) and then to (1,5) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I should check if any enemy snake is in that path. Snake #1 is at (7,5) with body at (8,2) and (7,2), so that's far away. So the path is clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (1,6), then another DOWN to (1,5) to eat that apple. So my immediate next move is DOWN.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider any possible threats or alternative paths. For example, if moving DOWN could lead me towards enemy snakes or other dangers. But given the current positions, moving DOWN is safe.\n\nAnother consideration is growing after eating the apple. Once I eat the apple at (1,5), I'll grow longer, which could potentially block my path if I'm not careful. But since I'm moving straight down, and there's nothing ahead, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, could I consider moving towards (0,2) or (0,0)? Those are further away, and maybe other snakes could get there first, but since Snake #1 is on the opposite side, it's possible, but I think it's better to go for the closer apple.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move DOWN to (1,6) next, then DOWN again to (1,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there.

Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7).

If I move towards (1,7), I don't think I'll be in danger from Snake #1 since it's on the other side of the board.\n\nLet me visualize the path. If I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that's one step. From there, I can move LEFT to (3,7), then to (2,7), and finally to (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's safe.\n\nI also notice an apple at (8,6). To reach that, I would have to move RIGHT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), but that's a longer path, and I might run into Snake #1's body at (7,6) if I'm not careful. It might not be worth the risk right now since (1,7) is closer.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5), which is even further away, so I'll ignore that for now. So, focusing on (1,7) seems like the best strategy.\n\nDo I have any other concerns? My snake is just the head at (4,8), so no body to worry about. Enemy snake's head is at (7,5), which is far enough that I don't have to worry about it in my next few moves, as long as I don't go towards that area.\n\nSo, the plan is to move DOWN to (4,7), then start moving LEFT towards (1,7). Once I reach (1,7), I'll have an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nWait, but after moving to (4,7), I should check if there's a better path. Maybe moving DOWN again to (4,6) would get me closer to some other apples, but (1,7) is still the closest. Also, moving DOWN to (4,7) doesn't seem to be blocked by anything.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving towards an apple that's a bit further but in a direction with fewer obstacles can be better. But in this case, (1,7) is the closest, and the path seems clear.\n\nI should also consider if any apples are placed in such a way that multiple snakes might go for them. But since I'm the only one I know of, I guess it's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be DOWN to (4,7), heading towards the apple at (1,7). Once there, I'll have more options, but for now, moving DOWN is the right step.\n\nAnother consideration: If I move DOWN, I'm at (4,7), which is one step away from the apple at (1,7). So, the next moves would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, which would get me there. That's three moves in total after this one, which is manageable.\n\nI think I've thought it through. Moving DOWN is the correct move to get closer to the apple without any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Maybe moving DOWN to (4,6) to potentially block any other path, but I don't see any enemy moves that would interfere. Plus, the apple at (1,7) is too tempting to ignore. \n\nI should also consider if any other moves might set me up for future apples. For example, moving RIGHT could take me towards the apple at (7,2), but that's six columns away, which isn't efficient. Sticking with the closest apple makes sense.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving in a certain direction can put me in a better position for future moves, even if it's a longer path now.

Now, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, I should update my position. After eating the apple, I've grown, so my body now includes the previous positions. But for movement, I'm focusing on the head, which is now at (1,7). The other apple positions are (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (9,5). Wait, no, the initial apples were at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Oh, but I just ate the one at (1,5)? Wait, no, the apple at (1,7). Wait, in the initial state, the apples were listed as (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Oh, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the user initially said apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). So when I was at (1,7), that's not an apple. Did I eat an apple? Wait, the board state showed an apple at (1,7) in row 1, column 7, indicated by \"A\". So I did eat that apple, which was at (1,7). That's correct.\n\nNow I need to plan my next move. After eating the apple at (1,7), I should look for the next closest apple. The remaining apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Since I'm at (1,7), the closest one would be (0,2), which is two units away (X=1 to X=0, but Y=7 to Y=2 is a significant jump). Alternatively, (1,5) is two Y units below me.\n\nWait, no, (1,5) is on the same X as me, but Y=5, so that's two down from (1,7). That might be the closest. Alternatively, (0,2) is one left and five down, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, (8,6) is also an option, but that's quite far. (9,5) is also far.\n\nSo, between (1,5), (0,2), and (0,0), (1,5) is the closest. But let me see the positions:\n\n- (1,7) to (1,5): move DOWN twice.\n- (1,7) to (0,2): move LEFT once and DOWN five times.\n- (1,7) to (0,0): move LEFT once and DOWN seven times.\n- (1,7) to (8,6): move RIGHT seven times and DOWN once.\n- (1,7) to (9,5): move RIGHT eight times and DOWN two times.\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest, requiring just two DOWN moves. That seems the best option.\n\nBut wait, what about enemy snakes? Snake #1 is at (7,5) with body segments possibly in between. So if I go down to (1,5), it's along the same X=1 line. Is that path clear?\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (1,7) to (1,5) is along Y=7 to Y=5, so I have to make sure that there are no obstacles or enemy snakes in that column. From the board state provided earlier, around X=1, Y=5 is where an apple is, so it's empty except for the apple. So moving DOWN from (1,7) to (1,6) and then to (1,5) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I should check if any enemy snake is in that path. Snake #1 is at (7,5) with body at (8,2) and (7,2), so that's far away. So the path is clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (1,6), then another DOWN to (1,5) to eat that apple. So my immediate next move is DOWN.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider any possible threats or alternative paths. For example, if moving DOWN could lead me towards enemy snakes or other dangers. But given the current positions, moving DOWN is safe.\n\nAnother consideration is growing after eating the apple. Once I eat the apple at (1,5), I'll grow longer, which could potentially block my path if I'm not careful. But since I'm moving straight down, and there's nothing ahead, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, could I consider moving towards (0,2) or (0,0)? Those are further away, and maybe other snakes could get there first, but since Snake #1 is on the opposite side, it's possible, but I think it's better to go for the closer apple.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move DOWN to (1,6) next, then DOWN again to (1,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Alternatively, (5,6) is a bit up and to the right, which might be a longer path.\n\nBut wait, let's check the board state again. The user provided the board, and I need to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. Let me visualize it again.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y is up, higher X is right.\n\nIn the board state, there's an apple at (5,6), which is up and to the right of my current position (1,5).

So the area near x=9 is occupied by that snake, making it a bit risky to go near there, but maybe not directly in my path.\n\nSo, my options are:\n\n1. Move towards (0,2): This is to the left and down from my current position. From (1,5), moving left would take me to (0,5), but that's not an apple. Then I'd have to move down to (0,2). That's a distance of 3 moves: left, then down three times. But maybe a more direct path is possible.\n\n2. Move towards (5,6): This is to the right and up. From (1,5), moving right would take me to (2,5), (3,5), etc., up to x=5, and then up to y=6. That's 4 moves right and 1 move up, total 5 moves.\n\n3. Move towards (8,6): That's further to the right and up, which would take longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other apples I should consider. Wait, the apples listed are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (5,6).

Let me calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (1,5):\n\n- To (0,2): Need to move left once to (0,5) (X decreases by 1), then down 3 times (Y decreases by 3) to (0,2). Total of 4 moves.\n\n- To (5,6): Move right 4 times (to x=5), then up once to y=6. Total of 5 moves.\n\n- To (0,0): From (1,5), move left to (0,5), then down 5 times. That's 1 + 5 = 6 moves.\n\n- To (8,6): Move right 7 times, then up once. That's 8 moves. Probably too far.\n\n- To (9,5): That's near the enemy snake, which is at (9,4). So moving to (9,5) might be risky because the enemy is right there, and their body segments could be blocking or I might run into them.\n\nSo, the closest apple in terms of moves is (0,2) at 4 moves, followed by (5,6) at 5 moves.\n\nNow, considering that, moving towards (0,2) seems more efficient. But is there any obstacle in the way?\n\nLooking at the board, from (1,5) to (0,5), there's nothing blocking because the enemy is on the other side, and the apples are elsewhere. Then from (0,5) to (0,2), I don't see any other snakes or apples blocking. Wait, but the board state shows that at (0,2) there's an apple, so that path is clear.\n\nWait, what about the other apple at (0,0)? That's further down, but I can get to (0,2) first and then decide whether to go further down to (0,0).\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,6) could be safer because that area seems less congested, but it's a bit further away.\n\nI also need to consider that my snake is now longer because I ate an apple. So I have to make sure I don't run into my own body. Since I was moving DOWN from (1,6) to (1,5), my body would be extending downward, so my next move wouldn't cause a collision.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy's possible moves. Snake #1 is at (9,4). If they move DOWN, they'd be at (9,3), which is already part of their body. If they move RIGHT, they're at (9,5), which is an apple. So maybe they're moving towards that apple. But since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it shouldn't affect me immediately.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move towards (0,2), I can potentially trap myself if I don't have a way to turn around, but since the board is 10x10, there's space to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,6) might give me more options to turn without hitting walls.\n\nSo, weighing the options: (0,2) is closer but requires moving left and down, while (5,6) is a bit further but might be safer in terms of future moves.\n\nI think I'll go for (0,2) because it's closer. So from (1,5), I need to move LEFT to (0,5), then DOWN to (0,4), (0,3), and (0,2). That's a total of 4 moves.\n\nBut I should also check if moving down from (1,5) is possible. Wait, no, because from (1,5), moving left gets me to (0,5). Then I can move down. Alternatively, if I move down from (1,5) to (1,4), but that might not be optimal because the apple is at (0,2), which is on the left.\n\nWait, maybe a better path is to go left first to (0,5), then down to (0,2). That way, I can eat the apple in 4 moves.\n\nWait, but when I move from (1,5) to (0,5), that's one move left. Then from (0,5), moving down to (0,4), (0,3), and (0,2) would take 3 more moves, totaling 4 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go right towards (5,6), I would have to move right 4 times and up once, which is longer but might set me up for reaching more apples later.\n\nHmm. Maybe (0,2) is the better choice for now.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT to (0,5). Then in the following moves, I can move down to reach (0,2).\n\nWait, but in the initial move after DOWN, I'm at (1,5). So my next move options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT from (1,5), I'd be at (0,5). Is there an obstacle there? Let me check the board.\n\nLooking at the board state provided, (0,5) is an apple? Wait, no. Wait, in the apples list, (0,2) and (0,0) are apples, but (0,5) isn't listed. So moving to (0,5) is safe.\n\nWait, the apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), (5,6). So (0,5) isn't an apple, which means moving there is fine.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (0,5) is safe. Then from there, I can move DOWN towards (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN from (1,5) to (1,4), but that doesn't help me reach (0,2) faster. So, moving LEFT is better.\n\nTherefore, my next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

This should be a more immediate concern than moving vertically since moving up or down doesn't directly contribute to getting closer to any apples at the moment.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that moving down takes you towards (9, 7) which doesn\u2019t particularly bring you closer to the closest apple efficiently or serve any strategic benefit as it merely increases the distance you\u2019ll need to cover horizontally later.\n\nYour priority should be to close in vertically (y-axis) while securing a path towards the apple, so making a move Left this turn prepares for a potentially safe downward move in the subsequent turn if the enemy snake does not move down into your intended path.\n\nMy strategy for next turn would be to assess the enemy's position after my move left and potentially continue down (twice) towards the apple if the path is clear. \n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (9,9), which is the top right corner of the 10x10 board. That's important because it means if I try to go any further right or up, I'll hit a wall, which would cause me to die according to the rules. So, my options for movement are probably limited to left or down in this turn.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that my snake is at (9,9), and the enemy snake, Snake #1, is right below me at (9,8). That's a bit concerning because if I move down, I'll be moving into the same position as Snake #1, which would mean I lose the game. So, moving down isn't a safe option right now.\n\nSo, the only safe direction I can move is left, which would take me to (8,9). But wait, let me check where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,6), which is a bit to the left and down from my current position. However, moving directly towards it from (9,9) would require me to go left and then down, but I can't do that in one move. So, maybe I should plan a path towards that apple. But first, I need to ensure I don't run into any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9) seems safe because I don't see any other snakes or apples there. The apples are at (0, 2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). So, (4,9) is an apple on my current row, but that's way to the left. I can't reach that in one move, but maybe in a few moves. However, the closest apple is at (8,6), which is two rows below me but to the left.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of left movement. So, to reach that, I might need to move left a few times and down, but I have to make sure that Snake #1 isn't blocking my path. Since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down from my position would be dangerous, so maybe I should avoid that for now.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to circle around? If I go left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and so on, I could potentially go around the board, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Also, I need to watch out for walls. Moving left from (9,9) to (8,9) is fine, but moving left too much without a plan might not be the best.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving left towards the center would give me more options. For example, if I start moving left, I could position myself closer to the apple at (4,9), but that's quite a distance. Alternatively, moving towards (8,6) seems more feasible.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible paths. From (9,9), moving left to (8,9), then down to (8,8), which is the same y as Snake #1's current position. But since Snake #1 is at (9,8), moving down into (8,8) is possible unless Snake #1 moves there. Hmm, but I don't know where Snake #1 will move next. So, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, could I move left to (8,9), then left again to (7,9), and then down towards the apple at (7,2)? That's quite a stretch, but it might be an option. Although, moving all the way left to (0,9) seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, I remember that another apple is at (4,9), which is in the same row I'm in. If I can move left to (8,9), then keep moving left each turn, I could reach (4,9) in five moves. But that would leave me vulnerable if Snake #1 moves towards me or if another snake appears.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm at (9,9), and moving left is the only safe option, I should take that first step. So, moving left to (8,9) makes sense. From there, I can reassess my next move based on where the other snakes are and where the apples are.\n\nAlso, considering rule 2, I can't run into myself, which isn't an issue here since I'm only moving forward. So, moving left to (8,9) seems like the safest and most strategic move right now. It allows me to get closer to the apples at (8,6) and (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nI should also consider that growing by eating an apple is important for gaining points. So, moving towards the nearest apple, even if it's not immediate, is a good idea. Therefore, my next move is to go left to (8,9), and then in subsequent moves, plan a path towards the closest apple, which is (8,6).\n\nAnother thought: If I move left to (8,9), perhaps Snake #1 will move away, allowing me to move down later. But I can't be certain of their movement. So, it's better to focus on my own path.\n\nSo, in summary, moving left to (8,9) is the best option to avoid walls and enemy snakes, while positioning myself closer to potential apples.\n</think>\n\n LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake ID 2 in this game. Let me try to understand the current situation. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (7,9). The apples are at (0,2), (8,6), (7,2), (0,0), and (4,9). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), and it doesn't have any body segments right now.\n\nFrom the board state, I see that my snake is at (7,9). Last move was LEFT, moving from (8,9) to (7,9). The rationale was to avoid the wall and get closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, but if I moved left from (8,9) to (7,9), I'm actually moving away from the apple at (8,6) because that's on the right side. Maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nSince I'm at (7,9), moving UP isn't possible because y=9 is the top of the board. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,9), and moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9). But wait, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is where I was last move. The enemy snake is at (8,7), so if I go to (8,9), I'm moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is two units below that.\n\nHmm, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,9) would be a good idea because it gets me closer to the apple at (8,6). From (8,9), I can then move DOWN to (8,8), and then again DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But wait, if the enemy is at (8,7), moving there would cause me to run into them, which is not allowed. So maybe that's a bad move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) would keep me in the same x-coordinate but lower y. But looking at the apples, there's one at (7,2), which is quite far down. That's five steps down from (7,9). Maybe it's better to go towards (8,6) instead.\n\nWait, let's check the positions again. My snake is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's a possible move. From there, next move could be DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous. Alternatively, maybe I can go around. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could be a way to get towards (7,2) eventually, but that's a longer path. But that apple is at (7,2), which is quite far. Maybe it's better to go for the closer apple at (8,6). Let me see how many steps that would take.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (8,9): 1 move RIGHT.\nThen from (8,9) to (8,6) would require moving DOWN three times. So that's a total of four moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not a good path.\n\nWait, maybe I can take a different route. Let me think about possible obstacles. The walls are at x=0, x=9, y=0, y=9. My snake is at (7,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) would take me further away from the apple at (8,6). Moving RIGHT seems more promising.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,9), then I can go DOWN to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8), then next move would be DOWN to (8,7), which is the enemy's position. That would cause me to collide with them, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,9) might not be the best idea because it leads me towards the enemy. Alternatively, perhaps I should move DOWN to (7,8) and then see if I can find another path towards an apple without colliding with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (4,9). Wait, that's at (4,9), same y as me, but x=4. To reach there, I'd have to go LEFT four times, but that's far. At (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9) in three moves. But is that apple still there? Because the board state shows that at y=9, x=4 has an apple. So that's an option. But is it worth going that far? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving towards (0,0), but that's too far. Maybe the apple at (8,6) is more accessible. But the problem is the enemy is at (8,7), blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can go around. From (7,9), if I go DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. Alternatively, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8), but that's the wall. So that's not possible either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider the possible paths without running into the enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), then from there, I can go DOWN to (8,8). From (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8), which is where I was if I had moved DOWN earlier. Then from (7,8), perhaps move DOWN further to get to (7,2). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer? The apple at (8,6) is the closest. To get there, I need to get to (8,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so maybe I can reach (8,6) before the enemy moves there.\n\nWait, but if I'm at (8,9), and enemy is at (8,7). If I go DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8), then next move to (8,7), which is the enemy's spot, but maybe the enemy will have moved by then. Or maybe not. I don't know how the enemy moves; it might be moving towards an apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), but then the enemy is at (8,7). So if I go to (8,8), then the enemy is below me at (8,7). So maybe I can go around that way.\n\nWait, maybe a better idea. Let me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9): From there, can I safely go towards (8,6) without hitting the enemy?\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7,8): Then, maybe go towards (8,6) via (8,8), but enemy is at (8,7).\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6,9): Then head towards (4,9), but that's far.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8,9). Then DOWN to (8,8). Then, from there, perhaps LEFT to (7,8), which is safe. Then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (7,8). Then RIGHT to (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. Can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get to (8,6) before the enemy does, but the enemy is already at (8,7), which is just one step above (8,6). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they would reach (8,6) next move. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't go for that apple because the enemy is closer.\n\nSo maybe the better option is to go for the apple at (4,9). Let's see, from (7,9), moving LEFT three times would get me to (4,9). That's an apple. Then, I can grow and gain a point. That might be safer than trying to go towards (8,6) where the enemy is.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then to (5,9), then to (4,9). That's three moves. But I have to make sure that I don't run into anything else. The board shows that at (4,9), there's an apple. So moving LEFT seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go to (4,9) and then proceed to other apples. But let me see if moving LEFT is possible.\n\nSo, next move: LEFT to (6,9). Then, in future moves, I can keep moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9). But I also have to be careful about the wall. Since x=0 is the left wall, moving LEFT from x=0 would cause me to die. But at x=4, I'm still safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go towards (7,2), which is another apple. That's at (7,2), which is five steps down from (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nWait, considering that after moving LEFT to (6,9), my next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), and so on. Let's check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFrom (7,9), LEFT to (6,9): Is there anything at (6,9)? Looking at the board state, the top row (y=9) has an apple at (4,9), my snake at (7,9), and at (8,9) and (9,9), nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe.\n\nThen, from (6,9), LEFT to (5,9): That's also safe. Then from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) where the apple is. So that would take me three moves. Once I reach (4,9), I would have grown by one segment and gained a point.\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN towards (7,8), but then I'm not sure where to go from there. The apple at (7,2) is quite far, and I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (8,7). If I move towards (8,6), I might run into the enemy. But if I go towards (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is safer.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue moving LEFT to (6,9), then proceed to (5,9) and (4,9) to collect that apple. This way, I avoid the enemy and gain a point.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from the apple at (8,6). Maybe I should prioritize that apple if possible. But since the enemy is at (8,7), it's risky. Maybe it's better to go for the safer apple at (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) where the enemy is. But that would cause a collision, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize the board.\n\nAt y=9, the row has apples at (4,9) and my snake at (7,9). The enemy is at (8,7), which is on y=7, x=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I can then move DOWN towards (8,6), but I have to avoid the enemy at (8,7).\n\nWait, perhaps I can move to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8). From there, the enemy is at (8,7), so I can go to (8,8) safely. Then, next move, the enemy might move DOWN to (8,6), but I can't know for sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move to (8,8) and then to (8,7), but that's where the enemy is.\n\nThis seems too risky. So perhaps the safer option is to go for the apple at (4,9). It's three moves away, but safe.\n\nSo, next move would be LEFT to (6,9). Then, in the following moves, continue moving LEFT to (5,9) and (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, I can reach (4,9) in three moves, which is manageable.\n\nI think that's the best option. So, I'll move LEFT to (6,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"

I was trying to get away from the wall and move towards the apple at (0,2), but I realized that moving LEFT again would take me to (3,9), which is still far from the apple. Hmm, maybe I should reassess my direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (7,2), (0,0), (9,5), (1,7), and (8,6). Since I'm at (4,9), the closest apple is actually (1,7), which is two steps down and to the left. If I go DOWN once, I'd be at (4,8), and then DOWN again to (4,7), but that's where an enemy snake's body is [(7,6)] for Snake #1. Wait, no, that's at (7,6). So maybe it's safe.\n\nWait, Snake #1's head is at (7,5) with body at (7,6). So moving to (4,7) is clear. From (4,7), I can then go LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), and grab the apple there. That would give me a point and let me grow.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (8,6), which is to the right of my current position.

Snake #1 is at (7,5), which is a bit away from me. So moving towards (1,7) seems safer and closer.\n\nSo, perhaps I should start moving DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,7).

My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should assess where I am. I'm at (4,8), which is on row 8, column 4. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving DOWN would decrease my Y-coordinate, moving me closer to the bottom, and moving UP would increase it, moving me towards the top.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (1,7). Let me check the distance. To get from (4,8) to (1,7), I need to move LEFT three times (from 4 to 1 on the X-axis) and DOWN once (from 8 to 7 on the Y-axis). Alternatively, I could move DOWN first and then LEFT. That might be a good way to approach it because moving DOWN first gets me closer to the Y-coordinate of the apple.\n\nSnake #1 is at (7,5) with a body at (7,6). That's a bit far from me, but I should still be cautious. If I move towards (1,7), I don't think I'll be in danger from Snake #1 since it's on the other side of the board.\n\nLet me visualize the path. If I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that's one step. From there, I can move LEFT to (3,7), then to (2,7), and finally to (1,7). That path doesn't seem blocked by any enemies or walls, so it's safe.\n\nI also notice an apple at (8,6). To reach that, I would have to move RIGHT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), but that's a longer path, and I might run into Snake #1's body at (7,6) if I'm not careful. It might not be worth the risk right now since (1,7) is closer.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,5), which is even further away, so I'll ignore that for now. So, focusing on (1,7) seems like the best strategy.\n\nDo I have any other concerns? My snake is just the head at (4,8), so no body to worry about. Enemy snake's head is at (7,5), which is far enough that I don't have to worry about it in my next few moves, as long as I don't go towards that area.\n\nSo, the plan is to move DOWN to (4,7), then start moving LEFT towards (1,7). Once I reach (1,7), I'll have an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nWait, but after moving to (4,7), I should check if there's a better path. Maybe moving DOWN again to (4,6) would get me closer to some other apples, but (1,7) is still the closest. Also, moving DOWN to (4,7) doesn't seem to be blocked by anything.\n\nAnother thought: Sometimes, moving towards an apple that's a bit further but in a direction with fewer obstacles can be better. But in this case, (1,7) is the closest, and the path seems clear.\n\nI should also consider if any apples are placed in such a way that multiple snakes might go for them. But since I'm the only one I know of, I guess it's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be DOWN to (4,7), heading towards the apple at (1,7). Once there, I'll have more options, but for now, moving DOWN is the right step.\n\nAnother consideration: If I move DOWN, I'm at (4,7), which is one step away from the apple at (1,7). So, the next moves would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, which would get me there. That's three moves in total after this one, which is manageable.\n\nI think I've thought it through.

There's another apple at (8,6), but that's on the other side of the board, so maybe after I eat (1,7), I can consider moving towards that one, but I need to assess the path then.\n\nSo, my immediate plan is to move LEFT again to get closer to (1,7). No need to change direction because that would take me away from the apple. I'll just continue moving LEFT until I reach (1,7).\n\nWait, in my last move, I was at (3,7), and I moved LEFT to (2,7). So I need to move LEFT again to (1,7). Yes, that makes sense. So my next move should be LEFT again to (1,7), where the apple is.\n\nI think that's the best move. I don't see any reason to change direction or move elsewhere. So, I'll proceed with LEFT again.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Now, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, I should update my position. After eating the apple, I've grown, so my body now includes the previous positions. But for movement, I'm focusing on the head, which is now at (1,7). The other apple positions are (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (9,5). Wait, no, the initial apples were at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Oh, but I just ate the one at (1,5)? Wait, no, the apple at (1,7). Wait, in the initial state, the apples were listed as (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Oh, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the user initially said apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). So when I was at (1,7), that's not an apple. Did I eat an apple? Wait, the board state showed an apple at (1,7) in row 1, column 7, indicated by \"A\". So I did eat that apple, which was at (1,7). That's correct.\n\nNow I need to plan my next move. After eating the apple at (1,7), I should look for the next closest apple. The remaining apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (1,5). Since I'm at (1,7), the closest one would be (0,2), which is two units away (X=1 to X=0, but Y=7 to Y=2 is a significant jump). Alternatively, (1,5) is two Y units below me.\n\nWait, no, (1,5) is on the same X as me, but Y=5, so that's two down from (1,7). That might be the closest. Alternatively, (0,2) is one left and five down, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, (8,6) is also an option, but that's quite far. (9,5) is also far.\n\nSo, between (1,5), (0,2), and (0,0), (1,5) is the closest. But let me see the positions:\n\n- (1,7) to (1,5): move DOWN twice.\n- (1,7) to (0,2): move LEFT once and DOWN five times.\n- (1,7) to (0,0): move LEFT once and DOWN seven times.\n- (1,7) to (8,6): move RIGHT seven times and DOWN once.\n- (1,7) to (9,5): move RIGHT eight times and DOWN two times.\n\nSo, (1,5) is the closest, requiring just two DOWN moves. That seems the best option.\n\nBut wait, what about enemy snakes? Snake #1 is at (7,5) with body segments possibly in between. So if I go down to (1,5), it's along the same X=1 line. Is that path clear?\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (1,7) to (1,5) is along Y=7 to Y=5, so I have to make sure that there are no obstacles or enemy snakes in that column. From the board state provided earlier, around X=1, Y=5 is where an apple is, so it's empty except for the apple. So moving DOWN from (1,7) to (1,6) and then to (1,5) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I should check if any enemy snake is in that path. Snake #1 is at (7,5) with body at (8,2) and (7,2), so that's far away. So the path is clear.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (1,6), then another DOWN to (1,5) to eat that apple. So my immediate next move is DOWN.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider any possible threats or alternative paths. For example, if moving DOWN could lead me towards enemy snakes or other dangers. But given the current positions, moving DOWN is safe.\n\nAnother consideration is growing after eating the apple. Once I eat the apple at (1,5), I'll grow longer, which could potentially block my path if I'm not careful. But since I'm moving straight down, and there's nothing ahead, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, could I consider moving towards (0,2) or (0,0)? Those are further away, and maybe other snakes could get there first, but since Snake #1 is on the opposite side, it's possible, but I think it's better to go for the closer apple.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move DOWN to (1,6) next, then DOWN again to (1,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Now, I need to decide what to do next.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (5,6). I'm now at (1,5) after eating the apple there. Wait, but in the initial description, my snake was at (1,5). Did I eat that apple already? I think so because I moved down to (1,5). So now, I'm one unit longer, but I should check which apples are still available.\n\nLooking at the apples left: (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (5,6). So I need to decide which one to target next. My current position is (1,5). The closest apple would logically be (0,2), which is to the left and down a bit, but let's see the coordinates.\n\nWait, (0,2) is at the bottom left, but I'm at (1,5), so to get there, I would have to move left to x=0, but that's possible. Alternatively, (5,6) is a bit up and to the right, which might be a longer path.\n\nBut wait, let's check the board state again. The user provided the board, and I need to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. Let me visualize it again.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y is up, higher X is right.\n\nIn the board state, there's an apple at (5,6), which is up and to the right of my current position (1,5). There's also an apple at (8,6), which is in the top right area. Another at (9,5), but that's near Enemy Snake #1.\n\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (9,4), with body parts at (9,3) and (9,2). So the area near x=9 is occupied by that snake, making it a bit risky to go near there, but maybe not directly in my path.\n\nSo, my options are:\n\n1. Move towards (0,2): This is to the left and down from my current position. From (1,5), moving left would take me to (0,5), but that's not an apple. Then I'd have to move down to (0,2). That's a distance of 3 moves: left, then down three times. But maybe a more direct path is possible.\n\n2. Move towards (5,6): This is to the right and up. From (1,5), moving right would take me to (2,5), (3,5), etc., up to x=5, and then up to y=6. That's 4 moves right and 1 move up, total 5 moves.\n\n3. Move towards (8,6): That's further to the right and up, which would take longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other apples I should consider. Wait, the apples listed are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), and (5,6). So after eating (1,5), which was already there, I need to go for another.\n\nWait, no, in the initial problem, the apples are at:\n\nApples at: (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), (5,6)\n\nMy snake is at (1,5) after moving DOWN from (1,6) where I was before. So, I have to decide where to go next.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's position. Snake #1 is at (9,4) with body parts at (9,3) and (8,2). That's on the right side of the board. So the area near x=9 is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, moving towards the apples on the left side, like (0,2) or (0,0), might be safer because there's less chance of encountering the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,6) could be a good option since it's closer in terms of the number of moves. Let me calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (1,5):\n\n- To (0,2): Need to move left once to (0,5) (X decreases by 1), then down 3 times (Y decreases by 3) to (0,2). Total of 4 moves.\n\n- To (5,6): Move right 4 times (to x=5), then up once to y=6. Total of 5 moves.\n\n- To (0,0): From (1,5), move left to (0,5), then down 5 times. That's 1 + 5 = 6 moves.\n\n- To (8,6): Move right 7 times, then up once. That's 8 moves. Probably too far.\n\n- To (9,5): That's near the enemy snake, which is at (9,4). So moving to (9,5) might be risky because the enemy is right there, and their body segments could be blocking or I might run into them.\n\nSo, the closest apple in terms of moves is (0,2) at 4 moves, followed by (5,6) at 5 moves.\n\nNow, considering that, moving towards (0,2) seems more efficient. But is there any obstacle in the way?\n\nLooking at the board, from (1,5) to (0,5), there's nothing blocking because the enemy is on the other side, and the apples are elsewhere. Then from (0,5) to (0,2), I don't see any other snakes or apples blocking. Wait, but the board state shows that at (0,2) there's an apple, so that path is clear.\n\nWait, what about the other apple at (0,0)? That's further down, but I can get to (0,2) first and then decide whether to go further down to (0,0).\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,6) could be safer because that area seems less congested, but it's a bit further away.\n\nI also need to consider that my snake is now longer because I ate an apple. So I have to make sure I don't run into my own body. Since I was moving DOWN from (1,6) to (1,5), my body would be extending downward, so my next move wouldn't cause a collision.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy's possible moves. Snake #1 is at (9,4). If they move DOWN, they'd be at (9,3), which is already part of their body. If they move RIGHT, they're at (9,5), which is an apple. So maybe they're moving towards that apple. But since I'm on the opposite side of the board, it shouldn't affect me immediately.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move towards (0,2), I can potentially trap myself if I don't have a way to turn around, but since the board is 10x10, there's space to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,6) might give me more options to turn without hitting walls.\n\nSo, weighing the options: (0,2) is closer but requires moving left and down, while (5,6) is a bit further but might be safer in terms of future moves.\n\nI think I'll go for (0,2) because it's closer. So from (1,5), I need to move LEFT to (0,5), then DOWN to (0,4), (0,3), and (0,2). That's a total of 4 moves.\n\nBut I should also check if moving down from (1,5) is possible. Wait, no, because from (1,5), moving left gets me to (0,5). Then I can move down. Alternatively, if I move down from (1,5) to (1,4), but that might not be optimal because the apple is at (0,2), which is on the left.\n\nWait, maybe a better path is to go left first to (0,5), then down to (0,2). That way, I can eat the apple in 4 moves.\n\nWait, but when I move from (1,5) to (0,5), that's one move left. Then from (0,5), moving down to (0,4), (0,3), and (0,2) would take 3 more moves, totaling 4 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go right towards (5,6), I would have to move right 4 times and up once, which is longer but might set me up for reaching more apples later.\n\nHmm. Maybe (0,2) is the better choice for now.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT to (0,5). Then in the following moves, I can move down to reach (0,2).\n\nWait, but in the initial move after DOWN, I'm at (1,5). So my next move options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT from (1,5), I'd be at (0,5). Is there an obstacle there? Let me check the board.\n\nLooking at the board state provided, (0,5) is an apple? Wait, no. Wait, in the apples list, (0,2) and (0,0) are apples, but (0,5) isn't listed. So moving to (0,5) is safe.\n\nWait, the apples are at (0,2), (0,0), (9,5), (8,6), (5,6). So (0,5) isn't an apple, which means moving there is fine.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (0,5) is safe. Then from there, I can move DOWN towards (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could move DOWN from (1,5) to (1,4), but that doesn't help me reach (0,2) faster. So, moving LEFT is better.\n\nTherefore, my next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"
