I think I'll continue to head towards that apple, as it's still a safer bet.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into the wall or Snake #1, which is at position (2, 1) with its body at [(2, 2)]. I'll try to avoid it for now.\n\nMy strategy for next turn will be to keep moving towards the apple at (0, 6) while keeping an eye out for potential dangers. Since I'm getting closer to the apple, I'll try to move UP to reach the apple.\n\nDecided next move: UP."
