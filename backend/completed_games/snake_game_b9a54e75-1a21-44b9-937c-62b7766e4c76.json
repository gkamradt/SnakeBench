However, the enemy snake at (8, 9) with its body at [(7, 9)] is still far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nI have two main options:\n1. Continue moving towards the apple at (8, 3) by going DOWN and LEFT.\n2. Change my target to the closer apple at (2, 0) and start moving LEFT.\n\nConsidering the proximity of the apples and the current position of the enemy snake, I believe it's more efficient to change my target to the apple at (2, 0). By moving LEFT, I'll be making progress towards this apple while also maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake and the edges of the board.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (2, 0), I can reassess the board state and decide on the next target based on the updated positions of the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next moves:\n- Move LEFT towards the apple at (2, 0).\n- Continue moving LEFT and DOWN to reach the apple efficiently.\n- After collecting the apple at (2, 0), reassess the board state and choose the next target apple based on proximity and safety.\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust my path if necessary to avoid collision or potential traps.\n- Prioritize apple collection while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake and the edges of the board.\n\nMy decision: LEFT"

I will continue to follow my strategy of looking for opportunities to eat more apples, monitoring Snake #1's movements, and ensuring there is no risk of collision with Snake #1 or the walls.\n\nThe apple at (9, 2) is not accessible at the moment, and moving towards it would put me closer to Snake #1. The apple at (8, 3) has already been eaten. The apple at (2, 0) is too far away, and moving towards it would require me to go down, which is not ideal since Snake #1 is moving downwards as well. The apple at (9, 6) has been eaten. The apple at (1, 7) is the most accessible apple right now.\n\nSince Snake #1 is moving downwards, I can move right and then up to eat the apple at (1, 7). This will keep me at a safe distance from Snake #1.\n\nMy next move is: RIGHT.\n\nFor the next turn, I will continue to look for opportunities to eat more apples, monitor Snake #1's movements, and ensure there is no risk of collision with Snake #1 or the walls.
