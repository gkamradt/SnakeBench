The apple at (1, 7) is quite far, but moving towards it might be a good long-term strategy.\n\nFor now, let's focus on getting closer to the apple at (6, 4) without moving directly towards the enemy snake. We can start by moving left.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (6, 4) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
