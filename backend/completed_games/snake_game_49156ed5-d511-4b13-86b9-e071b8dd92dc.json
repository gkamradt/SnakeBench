The Snake would run into the wall and die, so this move is out of the question.\n- Moving[right] would take the snake to (8, 8), and then to (9, 9) in the next move. This move seems safe but doesn't move the snake closer to an apple and may risk competing for space with the Snake #1.\n- Moving[down] would take the snake to (7, 4), which looks dangerous because it moves the snake closer to the enemy Snake #1 at (2, 4).\n\nGiven the current position and considering the enemy's position and the apple locations, moving[right] seems to be the most strategic approach here. It keeps Snake 2 safe, ensuring it doesn't run into any obstacles or the board's edge.\n\nFor the next turn, the strategy is to continue moving towards the apple at (9, 5), unless new information emerges that would require a course correction.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The goal is to avoid enemy snakes and get to an apple.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Moving[left] would take the snake to (7, 8). This move seems safe for now but mightMan needs to be cautious, as it doesn't bring the snake closer to any apple and may potentially lead to a counter-direction trap.\n- Moving[up] would take the snake to (8, 9), which is out of bounds. The Snake would run into the wall and die, so this move is out of the question.\n- Moving[right] would take the snake to (9, 8), and then to (9, 9) in the next move. This move seems safe but doesn't move the snake closer to an apple and may risk competing for space with the Snake #1.\n- Moving[down] would take the snake to (8, 4), which looks dangerous because it moves the snake closer to the enemy Snake #1 at (2, 4).\n\nGiven the current position and considering the enemy's position and the apple locations, moving[right] seems to be the most strategic approach here. It keeps Snake 2 safe, ensuring it doesn't run into any obstacles or the board's edge.\n\nFor the next turn, the strategy is to continue moving towards the apple at (9, 5), unless new information emerges that would require a course correction.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
