But currently, we're relatively centered.\n\n### Calculating Distances:\n\n- Distance from (1, 8) to each apple:\n  - (8, 1): |1 - 8| + |8 - 1| = 7 + 7 = 14\n  - (5, 2): |1 - 5| + |8 - 2| = 4 + 6 = 10\n  - (3, 2): |1 - 3| + |8 - 2| = 2 + 6 = 8\n  - (7, 6): |1 - 7| + |8 - 6| = 6 + 2 = 8\n  - (7, 1): |1 - 7| + |8 - 1| = 6 + 7 = 13\n\nThe closest apples are located at (3, 2) and (7, 6), both requiring 8 moves.\n\n### Decision:\n\nLet's prioritize heading towards one of the closest apples, while considering if any apples lie along the feasible and non-threatening path.\n\n- **Path to (3, 2)**:\n  - Move Right to get closer to (3, 2).\n\n- **Path to (7, 6)**:\n  - Move Down to align closer to the y-coordinate 6 first.\n\nGiven the current density of apples and positions, let's try to progress towards the apple at (3, 2) first as it requires fewer moves to get to the same x-axis that aligns us with (5, 2) as the next possible target.\n\n### Next Move:\n\nLet's prioritize flexibility while staying safe - moving **RIGHT** will help us reevaluate the positions next turn effectively. So, I'll choose that.\n\n**Decided Move**: RIGHT"

My goal is to get as many points as possible, so I'll try to get as close to those apples as I can.\n\nI notice that there are two apples relatively close to my current position, one at (8, 1) and another at (7, 6). I'll try to get closer to those apples first.\n\nHowever, I also need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake #1, which is at position (1, 8). I'll try to avoid going in that direction for now.\n\nAfter considering my options, I think I'll move... RIGHT. This will bring me closer to the apples at (8, 1) and (7, 6), and also give me some flexibility to adjust my direction if needed.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to get closer to the apples at (8, 1) and (7, 6), while keeping an eye out for the enemy snake #1.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
