It doesn't present any benefit toward reaching an apple or improving strategic position.\n   - **LEFT (to (7, 4)):** Moves away from the intended apple at (8, 0), delaying my goal of securing points.\n   - **UP (to (8, 5)):** Would mean reversing my previous move, which isn't allowed, and moves away from my apple target.\n   - **DOWN (to (8, 3)):** Continues on the clear path towards the apple at (8, 0), maintaining focus on achieving points efficiently.\n\n5. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - Continuing downward aligns well with the current objective of securing the apple at (8, 0). There's no competition from Snake #2 in this path, leaving it open for continued advancement.\n   - After reaching the apple at (8, 0), an immediate reassessment is necessary to determine the next target, likely the apple at (6, 3).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- Maintain vigilance on Snake #2\u2019s movements, particularly if it alters direction to an apple location near me.\n- Post-acquisition of the apple at (8, 0), assess the safest, most direct path to the next apple without risking a collision with Snake #2 or trapping myself.\n\nDecided Move: DOWN"
