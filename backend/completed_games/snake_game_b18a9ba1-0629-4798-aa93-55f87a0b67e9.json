This positioning provides several options to navigate toward the next objectives while keeping safe distances from potential threats.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n\n- After moving to (3, 3), continue towards the apple at (4, 2).\n- Remain aware of enemy snake movements, particularly if it starts descending the board.\n- Consider the option of going for the apples at (7, 3) or (0, 4) if they seem less contested.\n\nIn conclusion, my decided next move is: **RIGHT**."
