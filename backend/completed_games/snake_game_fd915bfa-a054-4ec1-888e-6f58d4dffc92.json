It also positions me towards the lower half of the board, where there are fewer obstacles.\n  - **Cons:** Reduces upward movement options, potentially limiting escape routes if the board becomes crowded.\n\n- **LEFT** to **(6, 7)**:\n  - **Safety:** The position (6, 7) is empty and within the board boundaries. Moving left does not result in an immediate collision with my body or the enemy snake.\n  - **Pros:** Moves me closer to the center-left area, providing better access to multiple apples such as **(6, 2)**. It also opens pathways towards other apples on the left side of the board.\n  - **Cons:** Slightly longer path to the nearest apples compared to moving down, but this is manageable with strategic navigation.\n\n- **RIGHT** to **(8, 7)**:\n  - **Safety:** The position (8, 7) is currently occupied by my tail. Moving here is potentially safe as the tail is expected to move forward unless I've just eaten an apple.\n  - **Pros:** Maintains current direction without significant changes.\n  - **Cons:** Reversing direction can lead to potential self-collisions, especially if the tail doesn't move as expected. Additionally, it doesn't contribute to apple collection.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n- **UP** offers safety but is suboptimal for apple collection.\n- **DOWN** brings me closer to valuable apples and aligns me towards the lower part of the board, enhancing scoring opportunities.\n- **LEFT** provides strategic positioning towards multiple apples and maintains flexibility for future maneuvers.\n- **RIGHT** poses a higher risk of collision with minimal benefits in terms of scoring.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns:**\n\nPrioritize moves that position me closer to multiple apples while maintaining safety and flexibility. Moving **DOWN** to (7, 6) not only brings me closer to apples like **(6, 2)** and **(7, 0)** but also keeps escape routes open. After collecting these apples, I can navigate towards the remaining ones while avoiding the enemy snake at **(2, 5)**. It's essential to monitor the enemy's movements to prevent potential collisions and ensure there's always an escape path available.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"

However, considering my last move was **DOWN** from **(7, 7)** to **(7, 6)**, moving **UP** would reverse direction, which is typically unsafe and could lead to a collision with my own body if the tail doesn't move as expected.\n  - **Pros:** Maintains proximity to the current vertical axis of movement.\n  - **Cons:** High risk of self-collision due to reversing direction. Doesn't contribute to advancing towards any apples.\n\n- **DOWN** to **(7, 5)**:\n  - **Safety:** The position **(7, 5)** is currently unoccupied and within board boundaries.\n  - **Pros:** Moves closer to the apple at **(6, 2)** and positions me toward the lower half of the board, where several apples are located.\n  - **Cons:** Continuously moving downward may limit upward escape routes if the board becomes crowded in that area.\n\n- **LEFT** to **(6, 6)**:\n  - **Safety:** The position **(6, 6)** is empty and within board boundaries. There's no immediate threat from enemy snakes or obstacles in this direction.\n  - **Pros:** Provides a direct path towards the apple at **(6, 2)**. Additionally, moving left opens up possibilities to navigate towards other apples on the lower left side of the board.\n  - **Cons:** Requires managing horizontal movement, which might introduce complexity in navigation but is manageable given the current board state.\n\n- **RIGHT** to **(8, 6)**:\n  - **Safety:** The position **(8, 6)** is unoccupied and within board boundaries. There's no immediate threat from enemy snakes in this direction.\n  - **Pros:** Opens up access to the apple at **(8, 0)**. Maintaining rightward movement can help in collecting apples located on the right side.\n  - **Cons:** Moving right takes me further away from the cluster of apples on the lower and left sides, potentially increasing the distance to collect multiple apples efficiently.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n- **UP** poses a significant risk of self-collision without offering strategic advantages in apple collection.\n- **DOWN** and **LEFT** both offer pathways towards valuable apples and maintain safe navigation routes.\n- **RIGHT** provides access to certain apples but may not be as efficient in accumulating points compared to moving **DOWN** or **LEFT**.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns:**\n\nPrioritize movements that balance safety with efficient apple collection. Moving **LEFT** to **(6, 6)** appears to strategically position me closer to multiple apples, especially **(6, 2)**, while maintaining flexibility for subsequent moves. This direction also avoids potential congestion in the lower area by allowing smooth navigation towards the left side of the board.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

Evaluating the possible directions for the next move:\n\n- **UP** to **(7, 7)**:\n  - **Safety:** This position appears to be unoccupied. However, considering my last move was **DOWN** from **(7, 7)** to **(7, 6)**, moving **UP** would reverse direction, which is typically unsafe and could lead to a collision with my own body if the tail doesn't move as expected.\n  - **Pros:** Maintains proximity to the current vertical axis of movement.\n  - **Cons:** High risk of self-collision due to reversing direction. Doesn't contribute to advancing towards any apples.\n\n- **DOWN** to **(7, 5)**:\n  - **Safety:** The position **(7, 5)** is currently unoccupied and within board boundaries.\n  - **Pros:** Moves closer to the apple at **(6, 2)** and positions me toward the lower half of the board, where several apples are located.\n  - **Cons:** Continuously moving downward may limit upward escape routes if the board becomes crowded in that area.\n\n- **LEFT** to **(6, 6)**:\n  - **Safety:** The position **(6, 6)** is empty and within board boundaries. There's no immediate threat from enemy snakes or obstacles in this direction.\n  - **Pros:** Provides a direct path towards the apple at **(6, 2)**. Additionally, moving left opens up possibilities to navigate towards other apples on the lower left side of the board.\n  - **Cons:** Requires managing horizontal movement, which might introduce complexity in navigation but is manageable given the current board state.\n\n- **RIGHT** to **(8, 6)**:\n  - **Safety:** The position **(8, 6)** is unoccupied and within board boundaries. There's no immediate threat from enemy snakes in this direction.\n  - **Pros:** Opens up access to the apple at **(8, 0)**. Maintaining rightward movement can help in collecting apples located on the right side.\n  - **Cons:** Moving right takes me further away from the cluster of apples on the lower and left sides, potentially increasing the distance to collect multiple apples efficiently.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n- **UP** poses a significant risk of self-collision without offering strategic advantages in apple collection.\n- **DOWN** and **LEFT** both offer pathways towards valuable apples and maintain safe navigation routes.\n- **RIGHT** provides access to certain apples but may not be as efficient in accumulating points compared to moving **DOWN** or **LEFT**.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns:**\n\nPrioritize movements that balance safety with efficient apple collection. Moving **LEFT** to **(6, 6)** appears to strategically position me closer to multiple apples, especially **(6, 2)**, while maintaining flexibility for subsequent moves. This direction also avoids potential congestion in the lower area by allowing smooth navigation towards the left side of the board.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"
