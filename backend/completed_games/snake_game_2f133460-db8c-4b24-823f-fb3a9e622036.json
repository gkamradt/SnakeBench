            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8,6). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (3,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,3), (2,2), (8,3), (1,4), and (3,0).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are located. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (8,6), which is near the top right. The closest apple to me is at (8,3), which is directly below me. That's only three units down. The other apples are further away, so maybe I should prioritize the closest one.\n\nBut wait, I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (3,2), which is on the left side, a bit below the middle. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving in a way that could lead me into a trap.\n\nLet me think about possible moves. From (8,6), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would take me to (8,7), which is still on the board. Moving down would take me to (8,5), which is also safe. Left would take me to (7,6), and right would take me to (9,6), but wait, the board goes up to (9,9), so (9,6) is valid. Hmm, but I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall or myself.\n\nWait, the rules say that if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So I need to make sure my next move doesn't cause that. My snake's body isn't shown, but since I'm at (8,6), I should assume that my body is behind me, so moving in the opposite direction might cause me to hit myself. But since my last move was None, I'm just at (8,6) with no previous direction, so I can choose any direction without worrying about hitting myself immediately.\n\nNow, focusing on the apples. The apple at (8,3) is directly below me. To get there, I can move down three times. That seems straightforward. Alternatively, the apple at (1,4) is further away, but maybe I can reach it after getting the closer one. The same with the others.\n\nBut I should also consider if the enemy snake might interfere. Since it's at (3,2), it's not blocking my path to (8,3). So moving down seems safe. Let me visualize the path: from (8,6) down to (8,5), then (8,4), then (8,3). Each step is safe because there are no walls or snakes in the way.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (8,3) would put me in a position where I can collect multiple apples. Looking at the board, (8,3) is an apple, and (8,6) is where I am. So moving down to (8,3) would allow me to collect that apple and grow. That seems like a good move.\n\nWait, but what about the apple at (1,4)? It's at (1,4), which is on the left side, near the top. To get there, I would have to move left several times, which might take longer and could potentially put me in a position where I'm exposed to the enemy snake. Plus, the enemy is at (3,2), so if I move towards (1,4), I might have to pass by (3,2), but since the enemy is only at (3,2) with no body, maybe it's not a problem. However, I should focus on the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nSo, the apple at (8,3) is the closest and easiest to reach without any obstacles. Therefore, moving down towards (8,3) makes sense. That way, I can collect the apple, grow, and gain a point without any risks.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting (8,3), I can decide whether to go for another apple or head towards a more strategic position. But for now, the immediate goal is to collect the closest apple.\n\nIn summary, the best move is to go down to (8,5), then continue down to (8,4), and finally to (8,3) to collect the apple. This path is clear and safe, allowing me to gain a point without any risks.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move DOWN towards the apple at (8,3). This path is clear and allows me to collect the apple quickly and safely.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

My snake is at (8,6), which is near the top right. The closest apple to me is at (8,3), which is directly below me. That's only three units down. The other apples are further away, so maybe I should prioritize the closest one.\n\nBut wait, I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (3,2), which is on the left side, a bit below the middle. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving in a way that could lead me into a trap.\n\nLet me think about possible moves. From (8,6), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would take me to (8,7), which is still on the board. Moving down would take me to (8,5), which is also safe. Left would take me to (7,6), and right would take me to (9,6), but wait, the board goes up to (9,9), so (9,6) is valid. Hmm, but I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall or myself.\n\nWait, the rules say that if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So I need to make sure my next move doesn't cause that. My snake's body isn't shown, but since I'm at (8,6), I should assume that my body is behind me, so moving in the opposite direction might cause me to hit myself. But since my last move was None, I'm just at (8,6) with no previous direction, so I can choose any direction without worrying about hitting myself immediately.\n\nNow, focusing on the apples. The apple at (8,3) is directly below me. To get there, I can move down three times. That seems straightforward. Alternatively, the apple at (1,4) is further away, but maybe I can reach it after getting the closer one. The same with the others.\n\nBut I should also consider if the enemy snake might interfere. Since it's at (3,2), it's not blocking my path to (8,3). So moving down seems safe. Let me visualize the path: from (8,6) down to (8,5), then (8,4), then (8,3). Each step is safe because there are no walls or snakes in the way.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (8,3) would put me in a position where I can collect multiple apples. Looking at the board, (8,3) is an apple, and (8,6) is where I am. So moving down to (8,3) would allow me to collect that apple and grow. That seems like a good move.\n\nWait, but what about the apple at (1,4)? It's at (1,4), which is on the left side, near the top. To get there, I would have to move left several times, which might take longer and could potentially put me in a position where I'm exposed to the enemy snake. Plus, the enemy is at (3,2), so if I move towards (1,4), I might have to pass by (3,2), but since the enemy is only at (3,2) with no body, maybe it's not a problem. However, I should focus on the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nSo, the apple at (8,3) is the closest and easiest to reach without any obstacles. Therefore, moving down towards (8,3) makes sense. That way, I can collect the apple, grow, and gain a point without any risks.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting (8,3), I can decide whether to go for another apple or head towards a more strategic position. But for now, the immediate goal is to collect the closest apple.\n\nIn summary, the best move is to go down to (8,5), then continue down to (8,4), and finally to (8,3) to collect the apple. This path is clear and safe, allowing me to gain a point without any risks.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move DOWN towards the apple at (8,3). This path is clear and allows me to collect the apple quickly and safely.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8,6). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (3,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,3), (2,2), (8,3), (1,4), and (3,0).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are located. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (8,6), which is near the top right. The closest apple to me is at (8,3), which is directly below me. That's only three units down. The other apples are further away, so maybe I should prioritize the closest one.\n\nBut wait, I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (3,2), which is on the left side, a bit below the middle. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving in a way that could lead me into a trap.\n\nLet me think about possible moves. From (8,6), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would take me to (8,7), which is still on the board. Moving down would take me to (8,5), which is also safe. Left would take me to (7,6), and right would take me to (9,6), but wait, the board goes up to (9,9), so (9,6) is valid. Hmm, but I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall or myself.\n\nWait, the rules say that if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So I need to make sure my next move doesn't cause that. My snake's body isn't shown, but since I'm at (8,6), I should assume that my body is behind me, so moving in the opposite direction might cause me to hit myself. But since my last move was None, I'm just at (8,6) with no previous direction, so I can choose any direction without worrying about hitting myself immediately.\n\nNow, focusing on the apples. The apple at (8,3) is directly below me. To get there, I can move down three times. That seems straightforward. Alternatively, the apple at (1,4) is further away, but maybe I can reach it after getting the closer one. The same with the others.\n\nBut I should also consider if the enemy snake might interfere. Since it's at (3,2), it's not blocking my path to (8,3). So moving down seems safe. Let me visualize the path: from (8,6) down to (8,5), then (8,4), then (8,3). Each step is safe because there are no walls or snakes in the way.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (8,3) would put me in a position where I can collect multiple apples. Looking at the board, (8,3) is an apple, and (8,6) is where I am. So moving down to (8,3) would allow me to collect that apple and grow. That seems like a good move.\n\nWait, but what about the apple at (1,4)? It's at (1,4), which is on the left side, near the top. To get there, I would have to move left several times, which might take longer and could potentially put me in a position where I'm exposed to the enemy snake. Plus, the enemy is at (3,2), so if I move towards (1,4), I might have to pass by (3,2), but since the enemy is only at (3,2) with no body, maybe it's not a problem. However, I should focus on the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nSo, the apple at (8,3) is the closest and easiest to reach without any obstacles. Therefore, moving down towards (8,3) makes sense. That way, I can collect the apple, grow, and gain a point without any risks.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting (8,3), I can decide whether to go for another apple or head towards a more strategic position. But for now, the immediate goal is to collect the closest apple.\n\nIn summary, the best move is to go down to (8,5), then continue down to (8,4), and finally to (8,3) to collect the apple. This path is clear and safe, allowing me to gain a point without any risks.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move DOWN towards the apple at (8,3). This path is clear and allows me to collect the apple quickly and safely.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8,6). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (3,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,3), (2,2), (8,3), (1,4), and (3,0).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are located. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (8,6), which is near the top right. The closest apple to me is at (8,3), which is directly below me. That's only three units down. The other apples are further away, so maybe I should prioritize the closest one.\n\nBut wait, I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (3,2), which is on the left side, a bit below the middle. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving in a way that could lead me into a trap.\n\nLet me think about possible moves. From (8,6), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would take me to (8,7), which is still on the board. Moving down would take me to (8,5), which is also safe. Left would take me to (7,6), and right would take me to (9,6), but wait, the board goes up to (9,9), so (9,6) is valid. Hmm, but I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall or myself.\n\nWait, the rules say that if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So I need to make sure my next move doesn't cause that. My snake's body isn't shown, but since I'm at (8,6), I should assume that my body is behind me, so moving in the opposite direction might cause me to hit myself. But since my last move was None, I'm just at (8,6) with no previous direction, so I can choose any direction without worrying about hitting myself immediately.\n\nNow, focusing on the apples. The apple at (8,3) is directly below me. To get there, I can move down three times. That seems straightforward. Alternatively, the apple at (1,4) is further away, but maybe I can reach it after getting the closer one. The same with the others.\n\nBut I should also consider if the enemy snake might interfere. Since it's at (3,2), it's not blocking my path to (8,3). So moving down seems safe. Let me visualize the path: from (8,6) down to (8,5), then (8,4), then (8,3). Each step is safe because there are no walls or snakes in the way.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (8,3) would put me in a position where I can collect multiple apples. Looking at the board, (8,3) is an apple, and (8,6) is where I am. So moving down to (8,3) would allow me to collect that apple and grow. That seems like a good move.\n\nWait, but what about the apple at (1,4)? It's at (1,4), which is on the left side, near the top. To get there, I would have to move left several times, which might take longer and could potentially put me in a position where I'm exposed to the enemy snake. Plus, the enemy is at (3,2), so if I move towards (1,4), I might have to pass by (3,2), but since the enemy is only at (3,2) with no body, maybe it's not a problem. However, I should focus on the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nSo, the apple at (8,3) is the closest and easiest to reach without any obstacles. Therefore, moving down towards (8,3) makes sense. That way, I can collect the apple, grow, and gain a point without any risks.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting (8,3), I can decide whether to go for another apple or head towards a more strategic position. But for now, the immediate goal is to collect the closest apple.\n\nIn summary, the best move is to go down to (8,5), then continue down to (8,4), and finally to (8,3) to collect the apple. This path is clear and safe, allowing me to gain a point without any risks.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move DOWN towards the apple at (8,3). This path is clear and allows me to collect the apple quickly and safely.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8,6). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (3,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,3), (2,2), (8,3), (1,4), and (3,0).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are located. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (8,6), which is near the top right. The closest apple to me is at (8,3), which is directly below me. That's only three units down. The other apples are further away, so maybe I should prioritize the closest one.\n\nBut wait, I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (3,2), which is on the left side, a bit below the middle. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving in a way that could lead me into a trap.\n\nLet me think about possible moves. From (8,6), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would take me to (8,7), which is still on the board. Moving down would take me to (8,5), which is also safe. Left would take me to (7,6), and right would take me to (9,6), but wait, the board goes up to (9,9), so (9,6) is valid. Hmm, but I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall or myself.\n\nWait, the rules say that if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So I need to make sure my next move doesn't cause that. My snake's body isn't shown, but since I'm at (8,6), I should assume that my body is behind me, so moving in the opposite direction might cause me to hit myself. But since my last move was None, I'm just at (8,6) with no previous direction, so I can choose any direction without worrying about hitting myself immediately.\n\nNow, focusing on the apples. The apple at (8,3) is directly below me. To get there, I can move down three times. That seems straightforward. Alternatively, the apple at (1,4) is further away, but maybe I can reach it after getting the closer one. The same with the others.\n\nBut I should also consider if the enemy snake might interfere. Since it's at (3,2), it's not blocking my path to (8,3). So moving down seems safe. Let me visualize the path: from (8,6) down to (8,5), then (8,4), then (8,3). Each step is safe because there are no walls or snakes in the way.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (8,3) would put me in a position where I can collect multiple apples. Looking at the board, (8,3) is an apple, and (8,6) is where I am. So moving down to (8,3) would allow me to collect that apple and grow. That seems like a good move.\n\nWait, but what about the apple at (1,4)? It's at (1,4), which is on the left side, near the top. To get there, I would have to move left several times, which might take longer and could potentially put me in a position where I'm exposed to the enemy snake. Plus, the enemy is at (3,2), so if I move towards (1,4), I might have to pass by (3,2), but since the enemy is only at (3,2) with no body, maybe it's not a problem. However, I should focus on the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nSo, the apple at (8,3) is the closest and easiest to reach without any obstacles. Therefore, moving down towards (8,3) makes sense. That way, I can collect the apple, grow, and gain a point without any risks.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After collecting (8,3), I can decide whether to go for another apple or head towards a more strategic position. But for now, the immediate goal is to collect the closest apple.\n\nIn summary, the best move is to go down to (8,5), then continue down to (8,4), and finally to (8,3) to collect the apple. This path is clear and safe, allowing me to gain a point without any risks.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move DOWN towards the apple at (8,3). This path is clear and allows me to collect the apple quickly and safely.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8,6). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (3,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,3), (2,2), (8,3), (1,4), and (3,0).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are located. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (8,6), which is near the top right. The closest apple to me is at (8,3), which is directly below me. That's only three units down. The other apples are further away, so maybe I should prioritize the closest one.\n\nBut wait, I also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (3,2), which is on the left side, a bit below the middle. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving in a way that could lead me into a trap.\n\nLet me think about possible moves. From (8,6), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would take me to (8,7), which is still on the board. Moving down would take me to (8,5), which is also safe. Left would take me to (7,6), and right would take me to (9,6), but wait, the board goes up to (9,9), so (9,6) is valid. Hmm, but I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall or myself.\n\nWait, the rules say that if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So I need to make sure my next move doesn't cause that.

Looking at the board, (8,3) is an apple, and (8,6) is where I am. So moving down to (8,3) would allow me to collect that apple and grow.
