My goal is to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls.\n\nFirst, I notice that there's an apple at (6, 2) which is relatively close to me. However, I also see that the enemy snake #2 is at (9, 2) which could potentially block my path or even kill me if I'm not careful.\n\nConsidering the risks and rewards, I think my best move is to head towards the apple at (6, 2) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake. To do this, I'll need to move left and then up.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the enemy snake and adjust my path accordingly. If the enemy snake moves towards me, I may need to change direction to avoid it.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
