Now, I need to consider the next moves to safely collect the apples and avoid collisions.\n\nThe closest apple is at (7, 6), but moving right into it would be dangerous as it would put me in the same row as Snake #1, which is currently at (7, 5). Therefore, I should not move right just yet. Instead, I should continue moving up to (5, 7) to avoid the enemy snake. This will position me one step away from the apple at (5, 6), which I can collect safely on the next turn by moving left.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (5, 6), I will need to plan my route to collect the other apples. The apple at (5, 3) is within reach, but I must be careful not to put myself in a position where Snake #1 could block me or where I might run into its body.\n\nHere's the strategy for the next few moves:\n1. Move UP to (5, 7) to avoid Snake #1.\n2. Move LEFT to (5, 6) to collect the apple.\n3. Move DOWN to (6, 6) to position myself for the next move.\n4.
