I need to stay a safe distance away from this snake while collecting apples.\n  \n### Summary of Strategy\n- Moving LEFT to (7, 3) will provide access to potential movement upwards as well as towards the left where the apples are located (5, 5).\n- If I go UP to (8, 4), I have no direct control of the subsequent necessary movements and could end up trapped.\n\n### Decision\nAfter weighing the options, moving LEFT to (7, 3) seems to be the most strategic.

Let's break down the scenario again with a focus on potential strategic outcomes:\n\n### Current Position and Options\n- **My position**: (8, 3)\n- **Available moves**:\n  1. **UP to (8, 4)** - This square is unoccupied and keeps me in the same column, which could be advantageous for future moves.\n  2. **DOWN to (8, 2)** - This is returning to a previous position, which is not allowed.\n  3. **LEFT to (7, 3)** - This square is open, and it gives access to other paths.\n  4. **RIGHT to (9, 3)** - This option is illegal since it would push me into the wall (out of the bounds of the 10x10 board).\n\n### Evaluating the Next Moves\n\n1. **UP to (8, 4)**: \n   - The position is free but doesn't immediately lead to apples nearby.\n   - It sets up vertical movement, which could be beneficial for exploring further up the board.\n\n2. **LEFT to (7, 3)**: \n   - This square is also free. Considering that apples (5, 5) are at a lower y, moving left allows lateral movement towards the apple column.\n\n### Apple and Enemy Snake Threats\n- The closest apples are at (5, 5) and (5, 8).\n- The enemy snake at (3, 3) and its body segment at (3, 4) remains a critical obstacle. I need to stay a safe distance away from this snake while collecting apples.\n  \n### Summary of Strategy\n- Moving LEFT to (7, 3) will provide access to potential movement upwards as well as towards the left where the apples are located (5, 5).\n- If I go UP to (8, 4), I have no direct control of the subsequent necessary movements and could end up trapped.\n\n### Decision\nAfter weighing the options, moving LEFT to (7, 3) seems to be the most strategic. It opens pathways for future maneuvers as well as creates opportunities for further movement towards the apples without coming close to enemy threats.\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

Moving towards that apple seems like the best choice right now as it's the safest and most accessible option.\n\nAfter grabbing that apple, I should reassess the board and plan my next moves accordingly. The remaining apples at (5, 8), (0, 9), (5, 5), and (3, 5) will be my next targets, but I'll need to be careful not to get too close to the walls or the other snake.\n\nMaintaining a central position on the board and avoiding potential traps should be my priorities. I'll try to stay away from the corners and navigate towards the apples while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next few moves would be:\n1. Move DOWN to grab the apple at (3, 1).\n2. After grabbing that apple, evaluate the positions of the remaining apples and the other snake.\n3.

It can potentially lead me closer to (5, 5).\n2. **DOWN to (7, 2)** - This is also a free space, but it doesn't provide a strategic advantage and takes me further away from the apples located at (5, 5) and (5, 8), as well as moving down potentially towards enemy snakes.\n3. **LEFT to (6, 3)** - This square is free and gains me lateral movement toward other paths and left towards the potential apple at (5, 5).\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 3)** - This is a reverse move onto the square I just occupied, which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating the Moves\n- **UP to (7, 4)**: This is a solid move as it keeps my options open while still heading vertically. However, it does not bring me fundamentally closer to the apples.\n- **LEFT to (6, 3)**: Moving left would provide a stronger positioning towards the apple at (5, 5). Also, moving left maintains options for future positioning and can open up access to further fruits while avoiding enemy snakes.\n- **DOWN to (7, 2)**: This move appears weak as it detracts from my goal of reaching the apples and puts me in a lower row where lateral movement is less useful in this scenario.\n\n### Risk Assessment\nThe enemy snake is currently positioned at (3, 1) with its body occupying (3, 2) and (3, 3). It\u2019s essential to avoid any potential encounters with the enemy snake, especially since I will want to move towards the apples without putting myself in a precarious position.\n\n### Strategic Summary\nGiven the situation, moving LEFT to (6, 3) seems optimal as it:\n- Keeps me on course toward collecting apples.\n- Avoids proximity to the enemy.\n- Maintains flexibility for lateral options on the board.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: **LEFT**."
