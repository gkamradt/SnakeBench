The apple at (2, 7) is open but requires navigation without clashing with Snake #2. \n\nSince I'm at (1, 6), my best move is **RIGHT** to (2, 6), as it sets up a position to potentially grab the apple at (2, 7) on the next move. Moving right advances my pursuit of the apple efficiently, and I can carefully plan from (2, 6) to either grab the apple or alter course considering the enemy's movement.\n\n### Future Strategy Reminder\n- Be ready to move toward the apple at (2, 7) immediately and avoid potential collision with Snake #2.\n- Observe Snake #2\u2019s strategy; keep my snake prepared to evade or outmaneuver.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

Moving here would result in a collision and immediate death.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (3, 7)\n   - **Pros:** Initially looks safe as it's the previous tail position.\n   - **Cons:** Since I just consumed an apple and grew longer, the tail at (3,7) remains occupied. Moving **RIGHT** would result in self-collision.\n\n**Safety Assessment:**\n- **LEFT** is immediately unsafe due to the enemy snake.\n- **RIGHT** is unsafe because the tail is still at (3,7) post-growth.\n- **UP** and **DOWN** are the only viable and safe options.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Moving DOWN** brings me closer to multiple apples and keeps me central, allowing for greater mobility in future moves.\n- **Moving UP** might limit immediate access to available apples and potentially box me in if the enemy snake decides to approach.\n\n**Decision:**\nTo maximize point gain while maintaining safety, I will **move DOWN** to (2, 6). This positions me advantageously towards several apples and keeps a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving down, I will reassess the board to target the nearest available apples, prioritize paths that offer the most flexibility, and continue avoiding collisions with enemy snakes and walls.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"
