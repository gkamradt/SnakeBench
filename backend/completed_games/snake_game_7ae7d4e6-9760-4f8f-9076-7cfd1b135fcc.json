Moving to the right as my previous plan stated, can be a risky move right now, as it could end up cornering me if snake #2, for some reason, decides to move right as well. \n\nApple at (3,6) is the closest but moving left towards it could be a problem if snake #2 decides to move left. Moving downwards is not beneficial right now because there are no apples in that direction and no advantage to that course. \n\nConsidering these factors, the best option right now would appear to continue moving upwards. Even if this takes me farther away from all the apples, it will keep me away from snake #2 and provide ample space in all directions for future turns allowing me more flexibility and the ability to reach any of the apples based on the further moves of snake #2. \n\nIn the next turn, I should aim to start moving towards the closest apple while ensuring to avoid any other snakes and the edges of the game board.\n\nSo, my next move should be: UP."

I see that I'm getting closer to the apple at (0, 3), which is a good thing. However, I also need to be careful not to run into snake #1, which is at position (2, 9) and is getting closer to me.\n\nI think I'll move... RIGHT. I want to try to get closer to the apple at (0, 3) while also keeping an eye out for snake #1. If I can get close enough, I might try to move down to get to the apple.\n\nNext turn strategy: I'll try to get closer to the apple at (0, 3) and then reassess my options. If I can get close enough, I might try to move down to get to the apple.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
