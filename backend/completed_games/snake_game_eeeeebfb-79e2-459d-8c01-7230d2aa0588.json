The closest apple to our current position appears to be at (3, 1), which is relatively near compared to the others.\n* **Threat Assessment**: Enemy Snake #1 is at (7, 9), which is far from our current position, posing no immediate threat given the distance and the fact that its body length is not specified (and appears to be empty, suggesting it might not be a significant threat at the moment).\n* **Objective**: Move towards the nearest apple to gain a point and grow, while avoiding any potential collisions with the wall, ourselves, or the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn (to keep in mind for the subsequent move)**:\n- After reaching the first apple, reassess the board to determine the safest and most efficient path to the next closest apple, considering the position and potential movement of Enemy Snake #1.\n\n**Analysis for This Move**:\n- To reach the apple at (3, 1) from our current position (5, 0), we need to move both left (to decrease our X coordinate from 5 to 3) and up (to increase our Y coordinate from 0 to 1).\n- Since we can only move in one direction per turn, we'll prioritize moving left first to start closing the distance in the X-axis, as moving up without adjusting our X position would not bring us closer to the target apple in an efficient manner.\n\n**Decided Next Move**:\nLEFT"
