As per rule 2, if I clash with another snake, I will die.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, my best move right now would be to go straight as my current position is (1, 9) and moving to the right would take me further away from my target apple.\n\nNext Move: UP"

I will start by moving towards the nearest apple, which is at (3, 5). I need to keep track of the enemy snake's position to avoid any collisions.\n\nMy next move: UP"
