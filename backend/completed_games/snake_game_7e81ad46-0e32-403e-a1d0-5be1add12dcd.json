There's an apple nearby at (9, 7), which will be accessible after this move. This move keeps me safe from any walls or enemies.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down to (8, 7) will bring me closer to the apple at (9, 7) as well, but it would require a subsequent move to the right. It is one of the safer options.\n- **UP**: This would take me to (8, 9), which doesn't immediately lead towards any apple, and unnecessarily approaches the boundary of the playing field.\n- **LEFT**: Would take me backwards and is not a preferred option since it doesn't bring me closer to any apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current scenario, moving **RIGHT** keeps me on a clear path towards an apple and is consistent with the plan set earlier. It minimizes complexity and ensures safety from the enemy snake due to sufficient distance.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- If I move to (9, 8), I will be in position to move down to (9, 7) and collect the apple.\n- Always continue to be aware of the enemy snake\u2019s movements and adjust strategy if it starts to move towards my current position or the apples I'm targeting.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"
