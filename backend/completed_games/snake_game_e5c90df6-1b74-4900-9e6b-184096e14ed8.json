However, it's a few steps away and requires a strategic approach.\n\n- **Immediate Apple at (7, 2):** I just captured this apple, and it is advantageous since it awards a swift point. But I must carefully plan my next moves to avoid being near the wall.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Security Moving Right:** Moving right previously accomplished capturing an apple, but now I must consider maneuverability. Continuing along the bottom wall could trap me. My next goal should be to move towards open spaces.\n\n2. **Central Map Positioning:** Central positioning offers more mobility options and reduces the risk of being cornered.\n\n3. **Opponent and Future Apple Paths:** Snake #2 is far away and shouldn't be an immediate concern. However, they'll likely move toward apples too, so claiming central apples might be wise for controlling the game.\n\n**Immediate Moves to Consider:**\n\n- **UP to (7, 3):** Opens a potential route towards (8, 5). This move keeps me away from the immediate danger of being trapped and keeps options open to centralize my position.\n\n- **LEFT to (6, 2):** Moving left is safer compared to staying near the wall. It could eventually direct me to (5, 3) but would further distance me from the more promising apple at (8, 5).\n\n- **RIGHT again to (8, 2):** Risk distinguishes this path as there are no apples directly east and a wall beyond. It would push me closer to the edge, offering no immediate reward.\n\n- **DOWN is out of question:** As it achieves absolutely no advantage and restricts further strategic advance. \n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe move UP to (7, 3) reflects strategic sense, securing flexibility while keeping my moves centralized toward accessible apples.

Apple at (3, 4): This apple is further back and would require more moves to reach.\n3. Apple at (7, 2): This is slightly to the right and upwards. It carries risk because Snake #2 is not a direct obstacle but could move closer.\n4. Apple at (8, 5) and (9, 8): These are farther away, especially since I am currently positioned lower on the board.\n\nNext, let's analyze the immediate implications of certain moves:\n\n- Going UP to (6, 2) keeps me on track to eventually approach apples at (5, 3) and (7, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 1) could help capture the closer apple at (5, 3) in subsequent moves, aligned with approaching it directly.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 1) isn\u2019t as strategic right now since the closer apple (7, 2) would require an upward move next.\n- Moving DOWN doesn\u2019t help capture any apples immediately and is not a meaningful move here.\n\nGiven a direct path and potential for capturing an apple soon safely without immediate threats, targeting the apple at (5, 3) is the optimal shorter-term strategy.\n\nStrategy Note: Keep moving towards the apple at (5, 3) unless an opportunity presents itself to reach another one with fewer risks in fewer moves.

It's an immediate option for growth. However, further moves need to keep me away from the wall on the right, and I'll need further strategic planning to avoid being cornered.\n\n3. **Other Apples:** Apples at (3, 4), (8, 5), and (9, 8) are not as immediately accessible or strategically positioned right now.\n\n**Immediate Moves to Consider:**\n\n- **UP to (6, 3):** Moving up keeps my options open to potentially approach either (5, 3) or (7, 2) in future moves.

The risk is slightly higher as I'd need to navigate the edges and possibly plan for subsequent moves without cornering myself. However, with careful planning and monitoring the rest of the board, this option secures a swift advantage.\n\nFuture Strategy: After capturing the apple at (7, 2), I will focus on moving towards the central area while aiming for apples, using cautious moves to avoid corner entrapment.\n\n**Decided Move:** RIGHT"

However, it's a few steps away and requires a strategic approach.\n\n- **Immediate Apple at (7, 2):** I just captured this apple, and it is advantageous since it awards a swift point. But I must carefully plan my next moves to avoid being near the wall.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Security Moving Right:** Moving right previously accomplished capturing an apple, but now I must consider maneuverability. Continuing along the bottom wall could trap me. My next goal should be to move towards open spaces.\n\n2. **Central Map Positioning:** Central positioning offers more mobility options and reduces the risk of being cornered.\n\n3. **Opponent and Future Apple Paths:** Snake #2 is far away and shouldn't be an immediate concern. However, they'll likely move toward apples too, so claiming central apples might be wise for controlling the game.\n\n**Immediate Moves to Consider:**\n\n- **UP to (7, 3):** Opens a potential route towards (8, 5). This move keeps me away from the immediate danger of being trapped and keeps options open to centralize my position.\n\n- **LEFT to (6, 2):** Moving left is safer compared to staying near the wall.

However, it's a few steps away and requires a strategic approach.\n\n- **Immediate Apple at (7, 2):** I just captured this apple, and it is advantageous since it awards a swift point. But I must carefully plan my next moves to avoid being near the wall.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Security Moving Right:** Moving right previously accomplished capturing an apple, but now I must consider maneuverability. Continuing along the bottom wall could trap me. My next goal should be to move towards open spaces.\n\n2. **Central Map Positioning:** Central positioning offers more mobility options and reduces the risk of being cornered.\n\n3. **Opponent and Future Apple Paths:** Snake #2 is far away and shouldn't be an immediate concern. However, they'll likely move toward apples too, so claiming central apples might be wise for controlling the game.\n\n**Immediate Moves to Consider:**\n\n- **UP to (7, 3):** Opens a potential route towards (8, 5). This move keeps me away from the immediate danger of being trapped and keeps options open to centralize my position.\n\n- **LEFT to (6, 2):** Moving left is safer compared to staying near the wall. It could eventually direct me to (5, 3) but would further distance me from the more promising apple at (8, 5).\n\n- **RIGHT again to (8, 2):** Risk distinguishes this path as there are no apples directly east and a wall beyond. It would push me closer to the edge, offering no immediate reward.\n\n- **DOWN is out of question:** As it achieves absolutely no advantage and restricts further strategic advance. \n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe move UP to (7, 3) reflects strategic sense, securing flexibility while keeping my moves centralized toward accessible apples. It's the direction that provides opportunities to pursue future apples like (8, 5) while maintaining a safe distance from the walls.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP"

Apple at (5, 3): This is to the left and slightly upwards. Moving towards this apple is a relatively safe option since there are no obstacles in close proximity.\n2. Apple at (3, 4): This apple is further back and would require more moves to reach.\n3. Apple at (7, 2): This is slightly to the right and upwards.

However, it's a few steps away and requires a strategic approach.\n\n- **Immediate Apple at (7, 2):** I just captured this apple, and it is advantageous since it awards a swift point. But I must carefully plan my next moves to avoid being near the wall.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Security Moving Right:** Moving right previously accomplished capturing an apple, but now I must consider maneuverability. Continuing along the bottom wall could trap me. My next goal should be to move towards open spaces.\n\n2. **Central Map Positioning:** Central positioning offers more mobility options and reduces the risk of being cornered.\n\n3. **Opponent and Future Apple Paths:** Snake #2 is far away and shouldn't be an immediate concern. However, they'll likely move toward apples too, so claiming central apples might be wise for controlling the game.\n\n**Immediate Moves to Consider:**\n\n- **UP to (7, 3):** Opens a potential route towards (8, 5).

Apple at (5, 3): This is to the left and slightly upwards. Moving towards this apple is a relatively safe option since there are no obstacles in close proximity.\n2. Apple at (3, 4): This apple is further back and would require more moves to reach.\n3. Apple at (7, 2): This is slightly to the right and upwards.

Apple at (8, 5) and (9, 8): These are farther away, especially since I am currently positioned lower on the board.\n\nNext, let's analyze the immediate implications of certain moves:\n\n- Going UP to (6, 2) keeps me on track to eventually approach apples at (5, 3) and (7, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 1) could help capture the closer apple at (5, 3) in subsequent moves, aligned with approaching it directly.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 1) isn\u2019t as strategic right now since the closer apple (7, 2) would require an upward move next.\n- Moving DOWN doesn\u2019t help capture any apples immediately and is not a meaningful move here.\n\nGiven a direct path and potential for capturing an apple soon safely without immediate threats, targeting the apple at (5, 3) is the optimal shorter-term strategy.\n\nStrategy Note: Keep moving towards the apple at (5, 3) unless an opportunity presents itself to reach another one with fewer risks in fewer moves.

However, it's a few steps away and requires a strategic approach.\n\n- **Immediate Apple at (7, 2):** I just captured this apple, and it is advantageous since it awards a swift point. But I must carefully plan my next moves to avoid being near the wall.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Security Moving Right:** Moving right previously accomplished capturing an apple, but now I must consider maneuverability. Continuing along the bottom wall could trap me. My next goal should be to move towards open spaces.\n\n2. **Central Map Positioning:** Central positioning offers more mobility options and reduces the risk of being cornered.\n\n3. **Opponent and Future Apple Paths:** Snake #2 is far away and shouldn't be an immediate concern. However, they'll likely move toward apples too, so claiming central apples might be wise for controlling the game.\n\n**Immediate Moves to Consider:**\n\n- **UP to (7, 3):** Opens a potential route towards (8, 5).

Apple at (5, 3): This is to the left and slightly upwards. Moving towards this apple is a relatively safe option since there are no obstacles in close proximity.\n2. Apple at (3, 4): This apple is further back and would require more moves to reach.\n3. Apple at (7, 2): This is slightly to the right and upwards. It carries risk because Snake #2 is not a direct obstacle but could move closer.\n4. Apple at (8, 5) and (9, 8): These are farther away, especially since I am currently positioned lower on the board.\n\nNext, let's analyze the immediate implications of certain moves:\n\n- Going UP to (6, 2) keeps me on track to eventually approach apples at (5, 3) and (7, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 1) could help capture the closer apple at (5, 3) in subsequent moves, aligned with approaching it directly.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 1) isn\u2019t as strategic right now since the closer apple (7, 2) would require an upward move next.\n- Moving DOWN doesn\u2019t help capture any apples immediately and is not a meaningful move here.\n\nGiven a direct path and potential for capturing an apple soon safely without immediate threats, targeting the apple at (5, 3) is the optimal shorter-term strategy.\n\nStrategy Note: Keep moving towards the apple at (5, 3) unless an opportunity presents itself to reach another one with fewer risks in fewer moves.

It's an immediate option for growth. However, further moves need to keep me away from the wall on the right, and I'll need further strategic planning to avoid being cornered.\n\n3. **Other Apples:** Apples at (3, 4), (8, 5), and (9, 8) are not as immediately accessible or strategically positioned right now.\n\n**Immediate Moves to Consider:**\n\n- **UP to (6, 3):** Moving up keeps my options open to potentially approach either (5, 3) or (7, 2) in future moves. This keeps me slightly more centered and flexible for subsequent decisions.\n\n- **LEFT to (5, 2):** This directly aligns me with the apple at (5, 3), making it accessible in the next move.

The risk is slightly higher as I'd need to navigate the edges and possibly plan for subsequent moves without cornering myself. However, with careful planning and monitoring the rest of the board, this option secures a swift advantage.\n\nFuture Strategy: After capturing the apple at (7, 2), I will focus on moving towards the central area while aiming for apples, using cautious moves to avoid corner entrapment.\n\n**Decided Move:** RIGHT"

However, it's a few steps away and requires a strategic approach.\n\n- **Immediate Apple at (7, 2):** I just captured this apple, and it is advantageous since it awards a swift point. But I must carefully plan my next moves to avoid being near the wall.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Security Moving Right:** Moving right previously accomplished capturing an apple, but now I must consider maneuverability. Continuing along the bottom wall could trap me. My next goal should be to move towards open spaces.\n\n2. **Central Map Positioning:** Central positioning offers more mobility options and reduces the risk of being cornered.\n\n3. **Opponent and Future Apple Paths:** Snake #2 is far away and shouldn't be an immediate concern. However, they'll likely move toward apples too, so claiming central apples might be wise for controlling the game.\n\n**Immediate Moves to Consider:**\n\n- **UP to (7, 3):** Opens a potential route towards (8, 5). This move keeps me away from the immediate danger of being trapped and keeps options open to centralize my position.\n\n- **LEFT to (6, 2):** Moving left is safer compared to staying near the wall. It could eventually direct me to (5, 3) but would further distance me from the more promising apple at (8, 5).\n\n- **RIGHT again to (8, 2):** Risk distinguishes this path as there are no apples directly east and a wall beyond. It would push me closer to the edge, offering no immediate reward.\n\n- **DOWN is out of question:** As it achieves absolutely no advantage and restricts further strategic advance. \n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe move UP to (7, 3) reflects strategic sense, securing flexibility while keeping my moves centralized toward accessible apples.

The y-axis movement keeps me centrally aligned.\n   \n2. **Central Position Security:** Continuing to maintain a position somewhat central avoids potential traps near the board edges and provides strategic flexibility.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Consideration:** Snake #2 is far off to the west, near (2, 4). Immediate competition for apples isn\u2019t a concern, allowing for more focused planning on closer objectives.\n\n**Immediate Moves:**\n\n- **UP to (7, 4):** Moves me directly along the plan for capturing the apple at (8, 5). This move keeps strategies open for next transitions and prepares for subsequent moves towards additional apples.\n\n- **LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN:** Left doesn't align with current apple captures, staying clear from the right is essential to avoid walls, and moving down presently offers no strategic advantage.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe planned move is UP to (7, 4). This strategically aligns my position to potentially capture the apple at (8, 5) while maintaining flexibility against board edges and future move adaptation. This plan prioritizes apple capture while keeping safe distance from immediate threats.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Focus on capturing apple at (8, 5).\n- Reassess following the capture to determine if pursuing (8, 6) is ideal next step.\n- Remain aware of board edges and other snakes.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP"

This is the most immediate goal as it only takes one move downward.\n\n3. **Threat Analysis:**\n   - **Enemy Snake #2:** Positioned at (8, 4) and its body extends horizontally at y = 3. If I move down, it will place me directly above this snake.\n   - **Walls:** I'm safely away from the walls, and a move down won't cause any issues with the boundaries at the moment.\n\n4. **Possible Moves:**\n   - **Move Down:** This will allow me to consume the apple at (8, 5) and grow, but it\u2019s crucial to note the presence of Snake #2 directly under me on the next turn. If Snake #2 continues its horizontal movement and I move further down after moving to (8, 5), there might be a risk if I need more planning for snake avoidance in upcoming turns.\n   - **Move Left or Right:** These moves don't currently lead to immediate apple collection and may not offer tactical advantages at this moment. The goal is to gather points as efficiently as possible.\n   - **Move Up:** While I already moved down last turn for an apple, moving up now doesn't align with my planned direction towards the apples below.\n\n5. **Strategic Consideration:**\n   - **Immediate Move:** Prioritize collecting the apple at (8, 5) by maintaining a move `DOWN`. This retains my proximity to points.\n   - **Post Apple Strategy:** After consuming the apple at (8, 5), I need to reassess the positioning of other snakes and how best to continue on the board without blocking myself or getting too close to Snake #2. I'll need to decide if it makes sense to pursue the next apple (8, 3) or consider moving away if Snake #2 poses a blocking threat.\n\n**Decision:**  \nMove `DOWN` to (8, 5) to collect the nearby apple and evaluate further movements based on the actions of Snake #2. Maintain flexibility to reposition if necessary in upcoming turns.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"

This means I grew in size and gained a point. The threat from below must now be considered more carefully.\n\n2. **New Board Considerations:**  \n   - Snake #2 is still positioned at (7, 4) with its body extending horizontally at y = 3. It's crucial that I remain vigilant about its movements to avoid collisions or trapping myself.\n   - Apples remain at (2, 0), (0, 8), (1, 1), (7, 1), and (1, 8). The apple most concerning in immediate position would be (7, 1).\n\n3. **Threat Analysis:**\n   - **Enemy Snake #2:** It's crucial to avoid heading further down immediately past my current position due to the position of Snake #2 at (7, 4), approaching (7, 3).\n   - Walls are still not a concern for the immediate move.\n\n4. **Possible Moves:**\n   - **Move Down:** Would place me potentially in line with Snake #2\u2019s body at (8, 3) if it decides to move vertically. This isn't ideal given current board layout.\n   - **Move Left:** Would position me to (7, 5), getting closer to an apple at (7, 1). Provides a bit more flexibility for upcoming turns compared to going down.\n   - **Move Right:** Leads towards the board boundary, which restricts movement in future turns without immediate benefit.\n   - **Move Up:** Retreating up to (8, 6) again, distances from new thunderstorms of the board's lower row, but moves away from goal of apple collection.\n\n5. **Strategic Consideration:**\n   - **Immediate Move:** It's essential to keep course towards maximizing apple collection but maintain strategic flexibility to ensure Snake #2 doesn't cut off potential routes. Given that, moving left allows me to redirect towards Apple at (7, 1) more safely.\n   - **Future Moves:** I'll need to keep a close watch on what Snake #2 does, especially if approaching horizontally changes or continues elsewhere around its current trajectory.\n\n**Decision:**  \nMove `LEFT` to (7, 5) to steer toward the apple at (7, 1), creating better distance from Snake #2's current path.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"
