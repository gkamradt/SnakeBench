            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules clearly.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (2,2), which is the starting point. There are several apples at positions (4,9), (0,1), (4,0), (5,3), and (7,7). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize my points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself (like moving backwards), I die.\n3. The objective is to have the most points by the end.\n\nI also have the last move information where I didn't move in any direction, so I didn't make any progress. That means I need to plan my next move carefully.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that there are apples at (4,9), (0,1), (4,0), (5,3), and (7,7). The snake is at (2,2), so I need to figure out which direction will allow me to collect the most apples without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The top right corner has an apple at (4,9), which is the highest y-coordinate. The bottom left has an apple at (0,1), which is the lowest x-coordinate. There's also an apple at (4,0), which is near the bottom. Then, (5,3) is somewhere in the middle, and (7,7) is towards the top right.\n\nSince I didn't move, I should consider moving in a direction that allows me to reach as many apples as possible. Let's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. **Up (direction 1):** Moving up from (2,2) would take me to (2,3). I need to check if this is a wall, another snake, or if it's empty. Looking at the board, (2,3) is empty, so that's good. If I move up, I can collect the apple at (4,9) if I can reach it from (2,3). But wait, (4,9) is in the top right, so moving up from (2,3) would take me to (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). But (2,9) is a wall, so I can't go beyond that. So from (2,3), moving up would take me to (2,4) and then to (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). But (2,9) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can only collect apples in the top row from (2,3) to (2,8). But (2,8) is empty, so I can collect the apple at (4,9) if I can reach it from (2,3). Wait, no, (4,9) is in the top right, so I can't reach it from (2,3) by moving straight up. I need to move towards (4,9), which is to the right and up. So moving up from (2,2) to (2,3) is not the best idea because I can't reach (4,9) from there. So maybe moving up isn't the best direction.\n\n2. **Down (direction 2):** Moving down from (2,2) would take me to (3,2). Let's see if that's a wall, another snake, or empty. (3,2) is empty, so I can move there. From (3,2), I can move down to (4,2), then to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2). (9,2) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples in the middle row from (4,2) to (8,2). The apples in the middle row are at (5,3) and (7,7). So moving down from (2,2) to (3,2) and then to (4,2) would allow me to collect the apple at (5,3) if I can reach it. But (5,3) is in the middle row, so moving down from (3,2) to (4,2) is not directly towards (5,3). I need to move right from (4,2) to (5,2), then to (5,3). So moving down from (2,2) to (3,2) is a good start, but I might not collect all the apples. Alternatively, moving down to (3,2) and then moving right to (5,2) and (5,3) would allow me to collect two apples. But I might miss some others.\n\n3. **Left (direction 3):** Moving left from (2,2) would take me to (1,2). Let's see if that's a wall, another snake, or empty. (1,2) is empty, so I can move there. From (1,2), I can move left to (0,2), which is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can only move left to (1,2). That's not a good idea because I can't reach any apples from there.\n\n4. **Right (direction 4):** Moving right from (2,2) would take me to (3,2). Let's evaluate this. From (3,2), I can move right to (4,2), then to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2). (9,2) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples in the middle row from (4,2) to (8,2). The apples in the middle row are at (5,3) and (7,7). So moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is a good start, but I might not collect all the apples. Alternatively, moving right to (3,2) and then moving down to (4,2) and then right to (5,2) and (5,3) would allow me to collect two apples. But I might miss some others.\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\n- Moving up: I can't reach (4,9) from (2,3), so probably not the best.\n- Moving down: I can collect (5,3) and (7,7) if I move right from (3,2).\n- Moving left: Not useful.\n- Moving right: I can collect (5,3) and (7,7) if I move right from (3,2).\n\nSo moving down or right seems better. Let's evaluate which one gives me more apples.\n\nIf I move down to (3,2), I can then move right to (5,2) and (5,3), collecting two apples. Then, from (5,3), I can move down to (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). (9,3) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples at (7,7) if I move down from (7,3). But wait, from (5,3), moving down to (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). (9,3) is a wall, so I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3). But (7,7) is in the top right, so I can't reach it from (7,3) by moving straight down. I need to move right from (7,3) to (8,3), then to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (8,9) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3). But I'm at (7,3), so I can move right to (8,3), then to (8,4), etc., but I can't reach (7,7) from (7,3) by moving straight right. I need to move right from (7,3) to (8,3), then down to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (8,9) is a wall, so I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3). Wait, no, (7,7) is in the same row as (7,3), so I can move right from (7,3) to (8,3), then down to (8,4), etc., but I can't reach (7,7) from (7,3) by moving straight right. I need to move right from (7,3) to (8,3), then down to (8,4), etc., but I can't reach (7,7) from (7,3) by moving straight right. So I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3).

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules clearly.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (2,2), which is the starting point. There are several apples at positions (4,9), (0,1), (4,0), (5,3), and (7,7). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize my points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself (like moving backwards), I die.\n3. The objective is to have the most points by the end.\n\nI also have the last move information where I didn't move in any direction, so I didn't make any progress. That means I need to plan my next move carefully.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that there are apples at (4,9), (0,1), (4,0), (5,3), and (7,7). The snake is at (2,2), so I need to figure out which direction will allow me to collect the most apples without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The top right corner has an apple at (4,9), which is the highest y-coordinate. The bottom left has an apple at (0,1), which is the lowest x-coordinate. There's also an apple at (4,0), which is near the bottom. Then, (5,3) is somewhere in the middle, and (7,7) is towards the top right.\n\nSince I didn't move, I should consider moving in a direction that allows me to reach as many apples as possible. Let's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. **Up (direction 1):** Moving up from (2,2) would take me to (2,3). I need to check if this is a wall, another snake, or if it's empty. Looking at the board, (2,3) is empty, so that's good. If I move up, I can collect the apple at (4,9) if I can reach it from (2,3). But wait, (4,9) is in the top right, so moving up from (2,3) would take me to (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). But (2,9) is a wall, so I can't go beyond that. So from (2,3), moving up would take me to (2,4) and then to (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). But (2,9) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can only collect apples in the top row from (2,3) to (2,8). But (2,8) is empty, so I can collect the apple at (4,9) if I can reach it from (2,3). Wait, no, (4,9) is in the top right, so I can't reach it from (2,3) by moving straight up. I need to move towards (4,9), which is to the right and up. So moving up from (2,2) to (2,3) is not the best idea because I can't reach (4,9) from there. So maybe moving up isn't the best direction.\n\n2. **Down (direction 2):** Moving down from (2,2) would take me to (3,2). Let's see if that's a wall, another snake, or empty. (3,2) is empty, so I can move there. From (3,2), I can move down to (4,2), then to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2). (9,2) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples in the middle row from (4,2) to (8,2). The apples in the middle row are at (5,3) and (7,7). So moving down from (2,2) to (3,2) and then to (4,2) would allow me to collect the apple at (5,3) if I can reach it. But (5,3) is in the middle row, so moving down from (3,2) to (4,2) is not directly towards (5,3). I need to move right from (4,2) to (5,2), then to (5,3). So moving down from (2,2) to (3,2) is a good start, but I might not collect all the apples. Alternatively, moving down to (3,2) and then moving right to (5,2) and (5,3) would allow me to collect two apples. But I might miss some others.\n\n3. **Left (direction 3):** Moving left from (2,2) would take me to (1,2). Let's see if that's a wall, another snake, or empty. (1,2) is empty, so I can move there. From (1,2), I can move left to (0,2), which is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can only move left to (1,2). That's not a good idea because I can't reach any apples from there.\n\n4. **Right (direction 4):** Moving right from (2,2) would take me to (3,2). Let's evaluate this. From (3,2), I can move right to (4,2), then to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2). (9,2) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples in the middle row from (4,2) to (8,2). The apples in the middle row are at (5,3) and (7,7). So moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is a good start, but I might not collect all the apples. Alternatively, moving right to (3,2) and then moving down to (4,2) and then right to (5,2) and (5,3) would allow me to collect two apples. But I might miss some others.\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\n- Moving up: I can't reach (4,9) from (2,3), so probably not the best.\n- Moving down: I can collect (5,3) and (7,7) if I move right from (3,2).\n- Moving left: Not useful.\n- Moving right: I can collect (5,3) and (7,7) if I move right from (3,2).\n\nSo moving down or right seems better. Let's evaluate which one gives me more apples.\n\nIf I move down to (3,2), I can then move right to (5,2) and (5,3), collecting two apples. Then, from (5,3), I can move down to (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). (9,3) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples at (7,7) if I move down from (7,3). But wait, from (5,3), moving down to (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). (9,3) is a wall, so I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3). But (7,7) is in the top right, so I can't reach it from (7,3) by moving straight down. I need to move right from (7,3) to (8,3), then to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (8,9) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3). But I'm at (7,3), so I can move right to (8,3), then to (8,4), etc., but I can't reach (7,7) from (7,3) by moving straight right. I need to move right from (7,3) to (8,3), then down to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (8,9) is a wall, so I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3). Wait, no, (7,7) is in the same row as (7,3), so I can move right from (7,3) to (8,3), then down to (8,4), etc., but I can't reach (7,7) from (7,3) by moving straight right. I need to move right from (7,3) to (8,3), then down to (8,4), etc., but I can't reach (7,7) from (7,3) by moving straight right. So I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3).

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules clearly.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (2,2), which is the starting point. There are several apples at positions (4,9), (0,1), (4,0), (5,3), and (7,7). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize my points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself (like moving backwards), I die.\n3. The objective is to have the most points by the end.\n\nI also have the last move information where I didn't move in any direction, so I didn't make any progress. That means I need to plan my next move carefully.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that there are apples at (4,9), (0,1), (4,0), (5,3), and (7,7). The snake is at (2,2), so I need to figure out which direction will allow me to collect the most apples without dying.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The top right corner has an apple at (4,9), which is the highest y-coordinate. The bottom left has an apple at (0,1), which is the lowest x-coordinate. There's also an apple at (4,0), which is near the bottom. Then, (5,3) is somewhere in the middle, and (7,7) is towards the top right.\n\nSince I didn't move, I should consider moving in a direction that allows me to reach as many apples as possible. Let's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. **Up (direction 1):** Moving up from (2,2) would take me to (2,3). I need to check if this is a wall, another snake, or if it's empty. Looking at the board, (2,3) is empty, so that's good. If I move up, I can collect the apple at (4,9) if I can reach it from (2,3). But wait, (4,9) is in the top right, so moving up from (2,3) would take me to (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). But (2,9) is a wall, so I can't go beyond that. So from (2,3), moving up would take me to (2,4) and then to (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). But (2,9) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can only collect apples in the top row from (2,3) to (2,8). But (2,8) is empty, so I can collect the apple at (4,9) if I can reach it from (2,3). Wait, no, (4,9) is in the top right, so I can't reach it from (2,3) by moving straight up. I need to move towards (4,9), which is to the right and up. So moving up from (2,2) to (2,3) is not the best idea because I can't reach (4,9) from there. So maybe moving up isn't the best direction.\n\n2. **Down (direction 2):** Moving down from (2,2) would take me to (3,2). Let's see if that's a wall, another snake, or empty. (3,2) is empty, so I can move there. From (3,2), I can move down to (4,2), then to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2). (9,2) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples in the middle row from (4,2) to (8,2). The apples in the middle row are at (5,3) and (7,7). So moving down from (2,2) to (3,2) and then to (4,2) would allow me to collect the apple at (5,3) if I can reach it. But (5,3) is in the middle row, so moving down from (3,2) to (4,2) is not directly towards (5,3). I need to move right from (4,2) to (5,2), then to (5,3). So moving down from (2,2) to (3,2) is a good start, but I might not collect all the apples. Alternatively, moving down to (3,2) and then moving right to (5,2) and (5,3) would allow me to collect two apples. But I might miss some others.\n\n3. **Left (direction 3):** Moving left from (2,2) would take me to (1,2). Let's see if that's a wall, another snake, or empty. (1,2) is empty, so I can move there. From (1,2), I can move left to (0,2), which is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can only move left to (1,2). That's not a good idea because I can't reach any apples from there.\n\n4. **Right (direction 4):** Moving right from (2,2) would take me to (3,2). Let's evaluate this. From (3,2), I can move right to (4,2), then to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2). (9,2) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples in the middle row from (4,2) to (8,2). The apples in the middle row are at (5,3) and (7,7). So moving right from (2,2) to (3,2) is a good start, but I might not collect all the apples. Alternatively, moving right to (3,2) and then moving down to (4,2) and then right to (5,2) and (5,3) would allow me to collect two apples. But I might miss some others.\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\n- Moving up: I can't reach (4,9) from (2,3), so probably not the best.\n- Moving down: I can collect (5,3) and (7,7) if I move right from (3,2).\n- Moving left: Not useful.\n- Moving right: I can collect (5,3) and (7,7) if I move right from (3,2).\n\nSo moving down or right seems better. Let's evaluate which one gives me more apples.\n\nIf I move down to (3,2), I can then move right to (5,2) and (5,3), collecting two apples. Then, from (5,3), I can move down to (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). (9,3) is a wall, so I can't go there. So I can collect apples at (7,7) if I move down from (7,3). But wait, from (5,3), moving down to (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). (9,3) is a wall, so I can collect apples at (7,7) if I can reach it from (7,3).

My snake is at position (3,1), which I assume is the head. The board has some apples at various coordinates, and there are other snakes around. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, the board is divided into 10 rows and 10 columns. The apples are at (4,9), (0,1), (4,0), (5,3), and (7,7). That means there are apples in the top right, middle left, top middle, middle lower right, and bottom right areas.\n\nMy snake is currently at (3,1). I think that's the head, and the body is at (2,1) and (3,0), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the problem says the snake ID is 1, which is currently positioned at (3,1). So, maybe the body is at (2,1) and (3,0). That makes sense because the snake moves from head to tail.\n\nNow, the enemy snake, which is snake #2, is at (7,9) with its body at []. So, it's at the top right corner, and I don't know where it's going yet. The board state shows some apples, but I'm not sure if it's showing the entire board or just a part of it. The last move was to the right, but I need to check if that's correct.\n\nThe rules say that if I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to avoid walls and other snakes. Also, moving left decreases x, right increases x, down decreases y, and up increases y.\n\nLooking at the apples, the top right is (4,9), which is close to my current position (3,1). If I move right from (3,1) to (4,1), I might land on (4,9) if I move right multiple times. Wait, no, moving right from (3,1) would take me to (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1). That's a long way. Alternatively, moving right from (3,1) to (4,1), then right again to (5,1), and so on. But I need to check if any of these positions have apples.\n\nLooking at the apples, (4,9) is the top right, so I don't think I can reach that from (3,1) in one move. Maybe I can move right to (4,1), then up to (4,2), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving right to (4,1), then right again to (5,1), but that's not an apple either. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can move right to (4,1), then down to (4,2), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving right to (4,1), then right again to (5,1), but that's not an apple. I'm not sure if I can reach any apples from (3,1) in one move. Maybe I need to move down first.\n\nIf I move down from (3,1) to (3,2), then right to (4,2), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving down to (3,2), then right to (4,2), then right to (5,2), but that's not an apple. I'm not sure if I can reach any apples from (3,1) in one move.\n\nWait, maybe I can move right to (4,1), then up to (4,2), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving right to (4,1), then right again to (5,1), but that's not an apple. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to move left, but that would take me to (2,1), which is empty. Then right to (3,1), but that's my head. So, I can't move left because that would take me back to my current position.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (3,2), then right to (4,2), then right to (5,2), but that's not an apple. I'm not sure if I can reach any apples from (3,1) in one move. Maybe I need to move right to (4,1), then up to (4,2), but that's not an apple.
