            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,9). The apples are located at (0,2), (8,0), (9,3), (4,7), and (7,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (7,7), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, moving left decreases it, moving up increases the y-coordinate, and moving down decreases it.\n\nMy position is (8,9), which is near the top-right corner. There are apples at (0,2), (8,0), (9,3), (4,7), and (7,4). I need to figure out which apple to go for first, considering both the distance and the potential paths that avoid the enemy snake and don't lead me into a trap.\n\nLet me plot out the positions:\n\n- My head: (8,9)\n\n- Enemy snake head: (7,7)\n\n- Apples: (0,2), (8,0), (9,3), (4,7), (7,4)\n\nI should consider the Manhattan distance to each apple to get an idea of which one is closest.\n\nManhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to each apple:\n\n1. (0,2):\n\n|8-0| + |9-2| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\n2. (8,0):\n\n|8-8| + |9-0| = 0 + 9 = 9\n\n3. (9,3):\n\n|8-9| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n4. (4,7):\n\n|8-4| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n5. (7,4):\n\n|8-7| + |9-4| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nSo, apples at (9,3), (4,7), and (7,4) are the closest, with distances 7 and 6.\n\nNow, I need to think about the paths to these apples and see if any of them put me in harm's way with the enemy snake.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (9,3):\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,3): need to move right to (9,9), then down to (9,3). That's a direct path, but I need to check if the enemy snake can intercept me.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,7). If I go to (9,9), then to (9,3), the enemy might try to block my path or intercept me. I need to consider its possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (4,7) or (7,4), which are also close.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (4,7):\n\n- From (8,9) to (4,7): need to move left to (4,9), then down to (4,7). That's a distance of 4 left and 2 down.\n\nAgain, I need to see if the enemy can get in my way.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,7). If I move left to (7,9), then to (6,9), then (5,9), then (4,9), and then down to (4,8) and (4,7). The enemy is at (7,7), so if I go left to (7,9), the enemy might move up to (7,8) or to (8,7), depending on its strategy.\n\nSimilarly, for the apple at (7,4):\n\n- From (8,9) to (7,4): move left to (7,9), then down to (7,4). That's a distance of 1 left and 5 down.\n\nAgain, the enemy is at (7,7), so if I move left to (7,9), the enemy might move up or down.\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to think about which path is safer and leads me to the apple without giving the enemy an opportunity to cut me off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (8,0), which is directly below me.\n\n- From (8,9) to (8,0): just move down 9 steps.\n\nBut the enemy is at (7,7), so if I move down, the enemy might try to intercept me somewhere.\n\nHowever, since the enemy is only at (7,7) and hasn't grown yet, its movement options are limited.\n\nWait, I don't know the rules for the enemy snakes' behavior. Do they move randomly, or do they follow a specific strategy? For now, I'll assume they try to reach the nearest apple or intercept me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the apple at (9,3) is a good idea because it's closer, and I can try to reach it before the enemy can react.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (8,0), which is directly below me, and the enemy would have to maneuver around me to intercept.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider growing as quickly as possible by going for the closest apple, which is (9,3), then (4,7) or (7,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't put myself in a position where I get boxed in or the enemy can cut me off.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the sequence of moves required to reach each apple and see if any of them lead me into a trap.\n\nLet's try planning a path to (9,3):\n\n1. Move right from (8,9) to (9,9)\n\n2. Move down to (9,8)\n\n3. Continue down to (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3)\n\nThat's a total of 1 right and 6 down moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy is at (7,7). If it moves down, it might try to intercept me at (9,7), but I'm moving down, and it would have to move right and then down, which might take more moves.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might try to block my path, but since I'm moving down, it would have to position itself in my way.\n\nBut considering the enemy is only one block right now, it's limited in its movements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider growing larger quickly by going for multiple apples in sequence.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (9,3), eat it, grow, then go for another apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get cornered while doing so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (8,0), which is directly below me.\n\nPath to (8,0):\n\n1. Move down from (8,9) to (8,8)\n\n2. Continue down to (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)\n\nThat's 9 down moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy is at (7,7). It can move right to (8,7), then down to (8,6), and try to intercept me.\n\nBut since I'm already on x=8, and the enemy would have to move to x=8, it might take more moves for the enemy to intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider moving diagonally or in a way that makes it harder for the enemy to predict my path.\n\nWait, in this game, can snakes move diagonally? Based on the board state, it seems movements are only up, down, left, right.\n\nSo, only orthogonal movements.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan a path that minimizes the chances of the enemy intercepting me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (4,7), which is at (4,7).\n\nPath to (4,7):\n\n1. Move left from (8,9) to (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)\n\n2. Then down to (4,8), (4,7)\n\nThat's 4 left and 2 down moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy is at (7,7). If I move left to (7,9), the enemy might move up to (7,8), then to (7,9), but I would have already moved left.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might move to (8,7), trying to block my path.\n\nBut if I continue moving left, the enemy would have to maneuver around me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (4,7) is a safer option.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (7,4):\n\nPath to (7,4):\n\n1. Move left from (8,9) to (7,9)\n\n2. Move down to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)\n\nThat's 1 left and 5 down moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,7), so if I move left to (7,9), then down, the enemy"

Possible moves are up to (8,9), down to (8,7), left to (7,8), or right to (9,8).\n\nI need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the apples while avoiding the enemy and not running into walls or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the positions:\n\n- Apples at:\n\n- (0,2)\n\n- (8,0)\n\n- (9,3)\n\n- (4,7)\n\n- (7,4)\n\n- My position: (8,8)\n\n- Enemy snake: (7,7)\n\nI need to calculate the distances to each apple and think about potential paths.\n\nLet's use Manhattan distance since we can only move up, down, left, right.\n\nDistance to (0,2):\n\n|8-0| + |8-2| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nDistance to (8,0):\n\n|8-8| + |8-0| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\nDistance to (9,3):\n\n|8-9| + |8-3| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nDistance to (4,7):\n\n|8-4| + |8-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nDistance to (7,4):\n\n|8-7| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (4,7) and (7,4), both with a distance of 5.\n\nNext closest is (9,3) at distance 6, and then (8,0) at distance 8, and finally (0,2) at distance 14.\n\nSo, logically, I should go for either (4,7) or (7,4) first.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and possible movements.\n\nEnemy is at (7,7). If I go for (4,7), I need to move left to (7,8), then (6,8), etc., which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, going for (7,4) would involve moving left to (7,8), then down to (7,7), and then\u7ee7\u7eed\u5411\u4e0b\u5230(7,4). But the enemy is at (7,7), so that might be risky.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,7), and I need to consider that the enemy can move as well. I don't know its behavior, so I'll assume it's trying to reach the nearest apple or intercept me.\n\nPerhaps going for (9,3) is a better idea. It's a bit farther at distance 6, but it might be safer.\n\nLet's think about the path to (9,3):\n\nFrom (8,8):\n\n- Right to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3)\n\nThat's 1 right and 5 down moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy is at (7,7). If it tries to intercept me, it would need to move right to (8,7), then down to (8,6), and so on, which might take more moves than my path to (9,3).\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might try to go for a different apple.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe I should consider growing quickly by going for multiple apples in sequence.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I don't get cornered or block my own path.\n\nLet me consider the path to (4,7):\n\nFrom (8,8):\n\n- Left to (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)\n\n- Then down to (4,7)\n\nThat's 4 left and 1 down.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy is at (7,7). If I move left to (7,8), the enemy might move up to (7,8), but I'm already there.\n\nWait, no, snakes can't occupy the same space, so the enemy can't move to a position already occupied by me.\n\nAssuming that, perhaps going left to (7,8) is safe, then\u7ee7\u7eed\u5de6\u79fb\u5230(6,8), (5,8), (4,8), then down to (4,7).\n\nSimilarly, for (7,4):\n\nFrom (8,8):\n\n- Left to (7,8)\n\n- Down to (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)\n\nThat's 1 left and 4 down.\n\nAgain, the enemy is at (7,7), so if I move left to (7,8), then down, the enemy might try to move up or down to intercept.\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,0):\n\nFrom (8,8):\n\n- Down to (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)\n\nThat's 8 down moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,7). If I move down to (8,7), the enemy might move right to (8,7), but again, snakes can't occupy the same space, so it can't be in the same position as me.\n\nBut I need to consider that the enemy might try to block my path or something.\n\nThis seems a longer path, and the enemy might have more opportunities to interfere.\n\nThe farthest apple at (0,2) is too far to consider right now.\n\nSo, weighing the options, going for (9,3) seems like a good choice. It's relatively close, and the path seems somewhat safe.\n\nLet me think about potential obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: empty\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . 1 .\n\nRow 6: empty\n\nRow 5: empty\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: empty\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, from (8,8), moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3).\n\nLooking at row 9, it's empty, so no issues there.\n\nRow 9: columns 0 to 9 are all empty, except possibly for the snake's body, but right now, only (8,8) is occupied by my head.\n\nWait, but (9,8) is within bounds, since x can be 0 to 9.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,8) is safe.\n\nThen down to (9,7), (9,6), etc., all the way to (9,3).\n\nI need to ensure that as I move down, the enemy doesn't intercept me.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,7), and it can move up, down, left, or right, but it can't occupy the same space as me.\n\nAssuming the enemy tries to reach me or get to an apple, perhaps it will try to move towards me or towards an apple.\n\nBut since I'm moving down, and the enemy is at (7,7), it would need to move right to (8,7), then down to (8,6), and so on, to intercept me.\n\nBut I'm moving down from (9,8) to (9,3), so the enemy would need to reach (9,?) somehow.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,7), and to get to my path,"
