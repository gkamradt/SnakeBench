I can reach it safely by moving DOWN one more step.\n- After reaching the apple at (6, 3), I should consider the apple at (4, 4) as my next target. It's relatively close and should be reachable without putting myself in danger.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT at this point would not be beneficial, as it would not bring me closer to any apples and could potentially complicate my path to the target at (6, 3).\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nI will follow through with my plan to reach the apple at (6, 3) by moving DOWN. This will allow me to grow and gain a point without exposing myself to any significant risks. Snake #2's position remains non-threatening for now, but I will continue to monitor its movements closely.\n\nAfter securing the apple at (6, 3), I will set my sights on the apple at (4, 4). I should be able to navigate towards it safely, as long as snake #2 doesn't make any sudden moves in my direction. I will need to assess the board state again after reaching (6, 3) to ensure that the path to (4, 4) remains clear and safe.\n\nMy overall strategy remains focused on safe and efficient growth, prioritizing nearby apples and avoiding confrontation with snake #2.
