Securing this apple is crucial for gaining a point and growing the snake, which would provide an advantage for survival and flexibility in future moves.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake Proximity**: Snake #2, positioned at (0, 3), poses little immediate threat currently given its distance and lack of a body that could block my path. However, the snake could pick a vertical path that may intersect with mine if I decide to move down in future turns.\n\n3. **Obstacles and Safe Paths**: \n   - Moving UP is not an option as I am already in the top row.\n   - Moving DOWN at this stage would take me away from the immediate goal of capturing the apple and toward Snake #2.\n   - Moving LEFT would move me away from the nearest apple and doesn't align with strategic goal acquisition.\n\n4. **Strategy for This Turn**:\n   - The best move for now is to continue moving RIGHT towards the apple at (5, 9). This move aligns directly with the strategic goal of securing more points while maintaining a safe distance from the other snake.\n   - If this apple is secured next turn, my upcoming focus should be either securing the apple at (6, 4) or positioning myself strategically for further growth and maintaining distance from potential threats.\n\n**Decided next move**: RIGHT"
