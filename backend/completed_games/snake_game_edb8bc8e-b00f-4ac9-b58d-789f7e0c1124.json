This is still a good strategy because:\n1. It's the closest apple\n2. The path is clear\n3. Enemy snake is far away and not a threat\n\nI will continue with LEFT movement to reach the (0, 9) apple. Once I get that apple, I can then plan a route down to the lower apple cluster at (0, 4), (1, 4).\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue LEFT if the path remains clear, watching for any sudden moves from the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "To optimize our chances of collecting nearby apples and avoiding collisions, let's continue moving diagonally towards the closest apple at (1, 4). Since our last move was to the right and the closest apple is one row below our current position, it's logical to make a vertical move this time. However, moving UP would take us out of bounds. A more valid strategy could be to move diagonally towards the apple while also keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position. Since we can't move UP this time, let's move RIGHT (to position (4, 5)). This move brings us closer to the apple at (1, 4) and doesn't put us in danger of colliding with the enemy snake. Strategy: Diagonal movement towards the closest apple. Our response is RIGHT. Our next move is RIGHT."
