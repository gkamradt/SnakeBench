Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirstly, my snake is at position (2,2), which is near the bottom left of the board. There are several apples on the board, and I need to decide which one to go for. The apples are located at (6,7), (2,5), (9,3), (9,7), and (2,9). Hmm, I should probably pick the closest one to me to minimize the risk of someone else getting it first or me running into trouble on the way.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (2,5). That's directly above my current position. Let me check the board again. Yeah, I'm at (2,2), so moving up three times would get me to (2,5). That seems manageable.\n\nBut wait, before I decide, I should also look at where the enemy snake is. Snake #2 is at (5,3). So, it's a few units to the right and up from my position. Right now, it doesn't seem like it's blocking my path to (2,5), but I should keep an eye on it. If it moves towards that area, I might have to rethink my plan.\n\nI also need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the walls.

Let me see. The apple at (2,5) is straightforward\u2014just up the same x-coordinate. The other apples are further away or in different directions. Going for (2,5) seems the safest and most efficient.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go UP. That way, I can reach the apple at (2,5) without any complications.

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. I'm controlling Snake #1, which is currently at (2,4). The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself. \n\nFirst, I should check where the apples are. From the board state, the apples are at (6,7), (2,5), (9,3), (9,7), and (2,9). The nearest one to my current position seems to be at (2,5), which is directly above me. Since my last move was UP, I probably moved from (2,3) to (2,4) last turn.\n\nNow, looking at where the enemy snake is. Snake #2 is at (4,4). That's just two spaces to the right of me on the same row. I need to be careful not to move into it or block myself. Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving to the right might not be the best idea right now because that could lead me towards the enemy, and I want to avoid collision.\n\nSo, the priority is to collect that apple at (2,5). That means I should move UP again. Moving up from (2,4) would take me to (2,5), which is the position of the apple. Collecting it would make me grow, giving me a point and making my snake longer, which is advantageous.\n\nBut I also need to think about what happens after I collect the apple. After moving up to (2,5), my next move should be to head towards another apple, maybe the one at (2,9). However, I should check if that's feasible without running into any obstacles or the enemy.\n\nWait, after collecting the apple, I should also consider the enemy's position. Snake #2 is at (4,4). If I'm at (2,5) next, moving right could take me towards (3,5), but I need to ensure that I don't end up in a position where I might be blocked or collide with the enemy in the future.\n\nAlternatively, after collecting the apple at (2,5), I might want to move right to expand my territory or go towards another apple, but I have to plan carefully. For now, though, my immediate next move is clear: moving UP to (2,5) to collect the apple. \n\nI should also make sure that by moving up, I'm not putting myself in a situation where I'm trapped or where the enemy can block me. But given that the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (2,4), moving up seems safe.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (2,5), collect the apple, and then reassess the situation from there. After that, I can decide whether to go for another apple, perhaps the one at (2,9), or maybe head towards the apples at (6,7) or (9,3) if they're within reach without encountering the enemy.\n\nWait, I should also consider the board's edges. Since the board goes from 0 to 9 in both x and y, moving beyond 9 or below 0 would result in me dying. So, I must stay within these coordinates.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after collecting an apple, my snake will grow, so I need to be mindful of my body's position. But since I don't have any body parts right now (as it's just the head at (2,4)), moving up won't cause me to run into myself. However, after growing, I'll have to manage my body's path to avoid self-collision in future moves.\n\nSo, to recap: current position (2,4), nearest apple at (2,5). Move UP to collect it. No immediate threats from the enemy if I stay on this path. So, the next move is definitely UP.\n\nAfter moving up to (2,5), I should look for the next closest apple, which would be (6,7). But that's several moves away. Alternatively, (2,9) is two more moves up from (2,5). Moving up to (2,9) would give me another apple, making me longer and stronger. So, perhaps, after (2,5), I can continue UP to (2,6), (2,7), etc., but I need to check if other snakes or walls are in the way.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (2,5), maybe I can then decide to move right towards the center of the board to avoid being cornered. But that's a consideration for after collecting the apple.\n\nIn any case, the immediate next step is clear: move UP to (2,5) and collect the apple. Then, I can plan the next moves based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirstly, my snake is at position (2,2), which is near the bottom left of the board. There are several apples on the board, and I need to decide which one to go for. The apples are located at (6,7), (2,5), (9,3), (9,7), and (2,9). Hmm, I should probably pick the closest one to me to minimize the risk of someone else getting it first or me running into trouble on the way.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (2,5). That's directly above my current position. Let me check the board again. Yeah, I'm at (2,2), so moving up three times would get me to (2,5). That seems manageable.\n\nBut wait, before I decide, I should also look at where the enemy snake is. Snake #2 is at (5,3). So, it's a few units to the right and up from my position. Right now, it doesn't seem like it's blocking my path to (2,5), but I should keep an eye on it. If it moves towards that area, I might have to rethink my plan.\n\nI also need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the walls. Since my snake's body is just at (2,2) right now, moving up won't cause me to hit myself. As I grow when I eat an apple, I have to be careful about that in future moves, but for now, it's not an issue.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I should check if any other apples are easier to reach without moving through potential danger zones. Let me see. The apple at (2,5) is straightforward\u2014just up the same x-coordinate. The other apples are further away or in different directions. Going for (2,5) seems the safest and most efficient.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go UP. That way, I can reach the apple at (2,5) without any complications. After that, I can reassess the board for the next move, maybe head towards another apple or respond to where the enemy snake moves.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple efficiently, I'll move UP towards (2,5). After that, I'll reassess the board for the next move.\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. I'm controlling Snake #1, which is currently at (2,4). The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself. \n\nFirst, I should check where the apples are. From the board state, the apples are at (6,7), (2,5), (9,3), (9,7), and (2,9). The nearest one to my current position seems to be at (2,5), which is directly above me. Since my last move was UP, I probably moved from (2,3) to (2,4) last turn.\n\nNow, looking at where the enemy snake is. Snake #2 is at (4,4). That's just two spaces to the right of me on the same row. I need to be careful not to move into it or block myself. Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving to the right might not be the best idea right now because that could lead me towards the enemy, and I want to avoid collision.\n\nSo, the priority is to collect that apple at (2,5). That means I should move UP again. Moving up from (2,4) would take me to (2,5), which is the position of the apple. Collecting it would make me grow, giving me a point and making my snake longer, which is advantageous.\n\nBut I also need to think about what happens after I collect the apple. After moving up to (2,5), my next move should be to head towards another apple, maybe the one at (2,9). However, I should check if that's feasible without running into any obstacles or the enemy.\n\nWait, after collecting the apple, I should also consider the enemy's position. Snake #2 is at (4,4). If I'm at (2,5) next, moving right could take me towards (3,5), but I need to ensure that I don't end up in a position where I might be blocked or collide with the enemy in the future.\n\nAlternatively, after collecting the apple at (2,5), I might want to move right to expand my territory or go towards another apple, but I have to plan carefully. For now, though, my immediate next move is clear: moving UP to (2,5) to collect the apple. \n\nI should also make sure that by moving up, I'm not putting myself in a situation where I'm trapped or where the enemy can block me. But given that the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (2,4), moving up seems safe.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (2,5), collect the apple, and then reassess the situation from there. After that, I can decide whether to go for another apple, perhaps the one at (2,9), or maybe head towards the apples at (6,7) or (9,3) if they're within reach without encountering the enemy.\n\nWait, I should also consider the board's edges. Since the board goes from 0 to 9 in both x and y, moving beyond 9 or below 0 would result in me dying. So, I must stay within these coordinates.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after collecting an apple, my snake will grow, so I need to be mindful of my body's position. But since I don't have any body parts right now (as it's just the head at (2,4)), moving up won't cause me to run into myself. However, after growing, I'll have to manage my body's path to avoid self-collision in future moves.\n\nSo, to recap: current position (2,4), nearest apple at (2,5). Move UP to collect it. No immediate threats from the enemy if I stay on this path. So, the next move is definitely UP.\n\nAfter moving up to (2,5), I should look for the next closest apple, which would be (6,7). But that's several moves away. Alternatively, (2,9) is two more moves up from (2,5). Moving up to (2,9) would give me another apple, making me longer and stronger. So, perhaps, after (2,5), I can continue UP to (2,6), (2,7), etc., but I need to check if other snakes or walls are in the way.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (2,5), maybe I can then decide to move right towards the center of the board to avoid being cornered. But that's a consideration for after collecting the apple.\n\nIn any case, the immediate next step is clear: move UP to (2,5) and collect the apple. Then, I can plan the next moves based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The apples are located at (6,7), (9,3), (9,7), (2,9), and (3,5). My snake's ID is 1, and I'm at (2,5). The enemy, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nMy last move was UP, which took me from (2,4) to (2,5), allowing me to collect the apple at (2,5). Now, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider where the apples are and which one I can reach next. The nearest apples are now at (2,9), (3,5), (6,7), (9,3), and (9,7). Since I'm at (2,5), moving UP to (2,6), (2,7), etc., would take me towards (2,9), which is an apple. That seems like a good target because it's in a straight line, and I can reach it by moving UP multiple times.\n\nHowever, I should check if moving towards (2,9) is safe. The enemy is at (4,4). If I move UP, I'm moving towards the upper part of the board, which is away from the enemy, so that seems safe. Moving DOWN would take me back towards the enemy, which could be risky. Moving LEFT would take me to (1,5), which doesn't have an apple nearby, and moving RIGHT would take me towards (3,5), where there's an apple. \n\nSo, I have two possible directions: UP towards (2,9) or RIGHT towards (3,5). Which one is better? \n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,5) would allow me to collect the apple there, but I have to be careful because the enemy is at (4,4). If I go to (3,5), I'm moving closer to the enemy, and if the enemy moves towards me, there might be a collision risk. On the other hand, moving UP to (2,6) keeps me away from the enemy and positions me to collect another apple at (2,9).\n\nAnother consideration is the potential growth of my snake. After collecting the apple at (2,5), my snake has grown to include (2,5) and (2,4). If I move UP to (2,6), I'll be extending my body further up. I need to ensure that my movements don't cause me to run into my own body in the future, but since I'm moving in a straight line, that shouldn't be a problem right away.\n\nAlso, looking at the board, there's an apple at (3,5). If I move RIGHT to (3,5), I can collect that apple and then decide whether to continue towards (2,9) or move in another direction. However, moving RIGHT might bring me closer to the enemy, which could be risky if the enemy decides to move towards me.\n\nSo, weighing the options: moving UP is safer and leads directly to another apple, while moving RIGHT offers a closer apple but with potential risks. Since safety is important to avoid dying, I think moving UP to (2,6) is the better choice. This way, I can collect the apple at (2,9) without encountering the enemy, and I can continue to grow my snake safely.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,6), heading towards (2,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

I need to ensure that my movements don't cause me to run into my own body in the future, but since I'm moving in a straight line, that shouldn't be a problem right away.\n\nAlso, looking at the board, there's an apple at (3,5). If I move RIGHT to (3,5), I can collect that apple and then decide whether to continue towards (2,9) or move in another direction. However, moving RIGHT might bring me closer to the enemy, which could be risky if the enemy decides to move towards me.\n\nSo, weighing the options: moving UP is safer and leads directly to another apple, while moving RIGHT offers a closer apple but with potential risks. Since safety is important to avoid dying, I think moving UP to (2,6) is the better choice. This way, I can collect the apple at (2,9) without encountering the enemy, and I can continue to grow my snake safely.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP to (2,6), heading towards (2,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

Apples are at (6,7), (9,3), (9,7), (2,9), and (3,5). The enemy, Snake #2, is at (3,5) with a body at [(3,4)]. My last move was UP, which put me at (2,6). \n\nI just collected an apple at (2,5), so my snake has grown by one segment. Now, I'm thinking about where to go next. The nearest apples are at (2,9) and (3,5). (2,9) is straight up from my current position, which is convenient because it's in a straight line. Moving UP would take me towards (2,7), (2,8), and then (2,9). That seems straightforward and without much risk.\n\nOn the other hand, (3,5) is to the RIGHT of me. Moving RIGHT would take me towards (3,6), but that's not an apple. Wait, the apple is at (3,5), which is actually diagonally down-right from my current position. So to get there, I'd have to move DOWN to (2,5) and then RIGHT to (3,5), but I just came from (2,5), and moving DOWN again would take me away from the apple at (2,9). Plus, the enemy is at (3,5), so moving towards there could be risky. There's a chance the enemy might move towards me, or I might run into them.\n\nSo, considering safety first, moving UP towards (2,9) seems like the better option. It's a direct path without any immediate threats. Also, since (2,9) is an apple, collecting it will make my snake longer and give me more points, which is the goal.\n\nBut wait, are there any obstacles or potential dangers if I move UP? The board has walls at the edges, but since I'm at (2,6), moving UP to (2,9) is within the 0-9 range for y-coordinates, so no wall collision there. My snake's body is currently at (2,5) and (2,6), so moving UP won't cause me to run into myself unless I make a U-turn, which I don't plan to do.\n\nAnother thing to think about is the enemy's movement. If Snake #2 is at (3,5), they might move towards the apple at (3,5), which is themselves, or maybe they'll go towards another apple. But since I'm moving away from them, it's less likely we'll interfere with each other in the next move.\n\nAlso, considering the future moves, after collecting (2,9), I might want to head towards another apple, like (6,7) or (9,7), but that's a longer path. But for now, moving UP is the safest and most direct path to the nearest apple.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the best move is to continue moving UP towards (2,9). That way, I avoid the enemy, grow my snake, and stay safe.\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirstly, my snake is at position (2,2), which is near the bottom left of the board. There are several apples on the board, and I need to decide which one to go for. The apples are located at (6,7), (2,5), (9,3), (9,7), and (2,9). Hmm, I should probably pick the closest one to me to minimize the risk of someone else getting it first or me running into trouble on the way.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one seems to be at (2,5). That's directly above my current position. Let me check the board again. Yeah, I'm at (2,2), so moving up three times would get me to (2,5). That seems manageable.\n\nBut wait, before I decide, I should also look at where the enemy snake is. Snake #2 is at (5,3). So, it's a few units to the right and up from my position. Right now, it doesn't seem like it's blocking my path to (2,5), but I should keep an eye on it. If it moves towards that area, I might have to rethink my plan.\n\nI also need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the walls. Since my snake's body is just at (2,2) right now, moving up won't cause me to hit myself. As I grow when I eat an apple, I have to be careful about that in future moves, but for now, it's not an issue.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I should check if any other apples are easier to reach without moving through potential danger zones. Let me see. The apple at (2,5) is straightforward\u2014just up the same x-coordinate. The other apples are further away or in different directions. Going for (2,5) seems the safest and most efficient.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go UP. That way, I can reach the apple at (2,5) without any complications. After that, I can reassess the board for the next move, maybe head towards another apple or respond to where the enemy snake moves.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple efficiently, I'll move UP towards (2,5). After that, I'll reassess the board for the next move.\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. I'm controlling Snake #1, which is currently at (2,4). The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself. \n\nFirst, I should check where the apples are. From the board state, the apples are at (6,7), (2,5), (9,3), (9,7), and (2,9). The nearest one to my current position seems to be at (2,5), which is directly above me. Since my last move was UP, I probably moved from (2,3) to (2,4) last turn.\n\nNow, looking at where the enemy snake is. Snake #2 is at (4,4). That's just two spaces to the right of me on the same row. I need to be careful not to move into it or block myself. Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving to the right might not be the best idea right now because that could lead me towards the enemy, and I want to avoid collision.\n\nSo, the priority is to collect that apple at (2,5). That means I should move UP again. Moving up from (2,4) would take me to (2,5), which is the position of the apple. Collecting it would make me grow, giving me a point and making my snake longer, which is advantageous.\n\nBut I also need to think about what happens after I collect the apple. After moving up to (2,5), my next move should be to head towards another apple, maybe the one at (2,9). However, I should check if that's feasible without running into any obstacles or the enemy.\n\nWait, after collecting the apple, I should also consider the enemy's position. Snake #2 is at (4,4). If I'm at (2,5) next, moving right could take me towards (3,5), but I need to ensure that I don't end up in a position where I might be blocked or collide with the enemy in the future.\n\nAlternatively, after collecting the apple at (2,5), I might want to move right to expand my territory or go towards another apple, but I have to plan carefully. For now, though, my immediate next move is clear: moving UP to (2,5) to collect the apple. \n\nI should also make sure that by moving up, I'm not putting myself in a situation where I'm trapped or where the enemy can block me. But given that the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (2,4), moving up seems safe.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (2,5), collect the apple, and then reassess the situation from there. After that, I can decide whether to go for another apple, perhaps the one at (2,9), or maybe head towards the apples at (6,7) or (9,3) if they're within reach without encountering the enemy.\n\nWait, I should also consider the board's edges. Since the board goes from 0 to 9 in both x and y, moving beyond 9 or below 0 would result in me dying. So, I must stay within these coordinates.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after collecting an apple, my snake will grow, so I need to be mindful of my body's position. But since I don't have any body parts right now (as it's just the head at (2,4)), moving up won't cause me to run into myself. However, after growing, I'll have to manage my body's path to avoid self-collision in future moves.\n\nSo, to recap: current position (2,4), nearest apple at (2,5). Move UP to collect it. No immediate threats from the enemy if I stay on this path. So, the next move is definitely UP.\n\nAfter moving up to (2,5), I should look for the next closest apple, which would be (6,7). But that's several moves away. Alternatively, (2,9) is two more moves up from (2,5). Moving up to (2,9) would give me another apple, making me longer and stronger. So, perhaps, after (2,5), I can continue UP to (2,6), (2,7), etc., but I need to check if other snakes or walls are in the way.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (2,5), maybe I can then decide to move right towards the center of the board to avoid being cornered. But that's a consideration for after collecting the apple.\n\nIn any case, the immediate next step is clear: move UP to (2,5) and collect the apple. Then, I can plan the next moves based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\nNext move: UP"

The enemy, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nMy last move was UP, which took me from (2,4) to (2,5), allowing me to collect the apple at (2,5). Now, I need to decide my next move. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider where the apples are and which one I can reach next. The nearest apples are now at (2,9), (3,5), (6,7), (9,3), and (9,7). Since I'm at (2,5), moving UP to (2,6), (2,7), etc., would take me towards (2,9), which is an apple. That seems like a good target because it's in a straight line, and I can reach it by moving UP multiple times.\n\nHowever, I should check if moving towards (2,9) is safe. The enemy is at (4,4). If I move UP, I'm moving towards the upper part of the board, which is away from the enemy, so that seems safe. Moving DOWN would take me back towards the enemy, which could be risky. Moving LEFT would take me to (1,5), which doesn't have an apple nearby, and moving RIGHT would take me towards (3,5), where there's an apple. \n\nSo, I have two possible directions: UP towards (2,9) or RIGHT towards (3,5). Which one is better? \n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,5) would allow me to collect the apple there, but I have to be careful because the enemy is at (4,4). If I go to (3,5), I'm moving closer to the enemy, and if the enemy moves towards me, there might be a collision risk.
