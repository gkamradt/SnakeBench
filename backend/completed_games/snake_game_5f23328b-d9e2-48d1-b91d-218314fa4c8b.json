First, move towards the closest apple at (8, 8).\n2. After getting the apple at (8, 8), focus on the apple at (7, 9).\n3. Move back and forth up and right to move in an engaging pivot formation for already cited segment until back pivot the corner.\n4. Regularly adjust and route to balance a safer move with nearby activation.\n\n### Strategy Next Turn:\nAfter capturing the apple at (8, 8):\na. Adjust direction to approach additional apples methodically checking available and accessible.\nb. Pivot then swilling for feasibility leading to remaining apples noted.\nc. Maintain a little slight offset dynamically and stead the regular moves within slightly common a pivot-y logic for either direction.\nd. Begin poling and peopling in an increment.\n\n### Decision:\nNext Move: **UP**"
