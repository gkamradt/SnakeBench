However, this move doesn't help me collect any apples immediately.\n\nMoving up would allow me to reach the apple at (9, 1) on the current turn, but it would also bring me closer to snake #2. This move could potentially lead to a collision in the future.\n\nMoving left would allow me to reach the apple at (8, 0) on the next turn. This move would also help me avoid snake #2 and potentially collect an apple on the next turn.\n\nConsidering the current state of the game and the potential for future collisions, I will move left (direction: LEFT) to avoid snake #2 and position myself to collect an apple on the next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to collect an apple while maintaining a safe distance from other snakes."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,6). There are apples at (0,9), (5,8), (6,2), (2,3), and (8,2). There's also another snake, number 1, at (9,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: A (apple at 0,9) and me at 9,6 which is somewhere in this row, but actually, looking at the board state you provided:\n\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n\n 8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . . . . . . . 2\n\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 3 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n 2 . . . . . . A . A .\n\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 0 . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nSo, I'm at (9,6), which is the bottom row, far right, with my ID 2.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,9): that's row 9, column 0, which is the top-left corner.\n\n- (5,8): row 8, column 5.\n\n- (6,2): row 2, column 6.\n\n- (2,3): row 3, column 2.\n\n- (8,2): row 2, column 8.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,0), which is the bottom-right corner, with no body parts, so it's just the head there.\n\nOkay, so my position is (9,6), and I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and try to plan a path to get to them without dying.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple. The apple at (0,9) is at the top-left, which is pretty far from my current position at (9,6). Let's calculate the Manhattan distance to get an idea:\n\nDistance to (0,9): |9-0| + |6-9| = 9 + 3 = 12 steps.\n\nDistance to (5,8): |9-5| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6 steps.\n\nDistance to (6,2): |9-6| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nDistance to (2,3): |9-2| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps.\n\nDistance to (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,2), only 5 steps away. Let's see if that's a feasible path.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (5,8), which is 6 steps away, and (6,2) is 7 steps away.\n\nI should also consider the positions of the enemy snake. Snake 1 is at (9,0), which is on the bottom row, far right. Since it's only the head with no body parts, it's probably smaller than me, assuming that snakes grow by eating apples.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake. If I grow longer by eating apples, I might have to be careful not to bump into my own body.\n\nLet me think about the path to (8,2). From (9,6) to (8,2):\n\nFirst, I need to move left to decrease my X coordinate from 9 to 8, and also move down to decrease my Y coordinate from 6 to 2.\n\nBut wait, Y increases upwards, so moving down would decrease Y.\n\nHmm, but in the board representation, higher Y is up, so moving up increases Y, and down decreases Y.\n\nWait, in the board, row 9 is at the top, row 0 is at the bottom, which is a bit confusing because usually, Y increases upwards, but here, higher Y is up.\n\nSo, to move towards (8,2) from (9,6), I need to move left (decrease X from 9 to 8) and down (decrease Y from 6 to 2).\n\nBut let's look at the board again:\n\nRow 9 is at the top, row 0 is at the bottom.\n\nSo, moving up would be towards higher Y, which is upwards on the board.\n\nMoving down is towards lower Y, downwards on the board.\n\nSo, to go from (9,6) to (8,2), I need to move left (decrease X to 8) and down (decrease Y to 2).\n\nBut, looking at the board, (9,6) is at row 6, column 9, which is actually row 6, column 9, but in the board representation, it's row 6, column 9, with 0,0 at bottom left.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify the coordinates:\n\n- X ranges from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\n- Y ranges from 0 to 9, bottom to top.\n\nSo, (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n\nMy position is (9,6), which is on row 6, column 9, which is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is on row 2, column 8, which is higher up.\n\nSo, to get there, I need to move up (increase Y from 6 to 2? Wait, no, higher Y is up, so to go from Y=6 to Y=2, I need to move down (decrease Y).\n\nBut according to the board, row 9 is at the top, so higher Y is up.\n\nWait, but in standard coordinate systems, Y increasing upwards, but in this board, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom, so Y increases upwards.\n\nTherefore, to increase Y, I move up, to decrease Y, I move down.\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (8,2):\n\n- Decrease X from 9 to 8 (move left)\n\n- Decrease Y from 6 to 2 (move down)\n\nWait, but Y=6 to Y=2 means moving down, since Y decreases when moving down.\n\nBut in the board, row 6 is lower than row 2.\n\nWait, I think there's confusion in the board representation.\n\nLet me look back at the board you provided:\n\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n\n 8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . . . . . . . 2\n\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 3 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n 2 . . . . . . A . A .\n\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 0 . . . . . . . . . 1\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, rows are listed from 9 to 0, with 9 at the top.\n\nSo, in this case, Y=9 is the top row, Y=0 is the bottom row.\n\nTherefore, to move towards higher Y, I need to move up, and to move towards lower Y, I need to move down.\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (8,2):\n\n- X changes from 9 to 8: move left\n\n- Y changes from 6 to 2: move down (since Y decreases when moving down)\n\nWait, but Y=6 is lower than Y=2, so to go from Y=6 to Y=2, I need to move up (towards higher Y).\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, no, if Y=9 is the top row, and Y=0 is the bottom row, then higher Y is up.\n\nSo, to increase Y, I move up, to decrease Y, I move down.\n\nTherefore, from Y=6 to Y=2, I need to move down, even though Y decreases.\n\nBecause higher Y is up, so decreasing Y means moving down.\n\nSimilarly, X increases from left to right.\n\nSo, from X=9 to X=8, I need to move left.\n\nTherefore, to reach (8,2) from (9,6), I need to move left and down.\n\nBut I need to plan a path carefully, making sure I don't run into walls or the enemy snake.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\nFirst, I can move left or up or down. I can't move right because that would be towards higher X, which is already at the edge.\n\nWait, X ranges from 0 to 9, so moving"
