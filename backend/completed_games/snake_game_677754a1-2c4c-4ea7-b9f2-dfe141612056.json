Enemy snake is at (9, 9), far from me\n\nStrategy:\n- Since I have no body yet (this seems to be the start), I can move in any direction safely\n- The closest apple appears to be at (5, 3)\n- I should probably start moving down and right towards that apple\n- Moving RIGHT would be a good first step towards that apple\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving right, I'll need to move down to get closer to the apple at (5, 3).\n\nRIGHT"

Since I'm currently at (9, 9), I can move up (y-1), down (y+1), left (x-1), or right (x+1).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples and my current position. I'm already at the top right corner of the board, so moving up (y-1) or left (x-1) would not help me collect any apples. Moving down (y+1) would take me closer to the apple at (0, 0), but it's risky because I might collide with snake #1, which is at (4, 8).\n\nMoving right (x+1) would take me towards the apple at (8, 6), but it's the safest option since I'm not moving towards any other snakes or walls.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to collect the apple at (8, 6) and then move towards the apple at (0, 4) if possible, while avoiding snake #1.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
