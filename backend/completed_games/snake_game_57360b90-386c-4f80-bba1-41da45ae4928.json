This move allows you to collect an apple, gain a point, and maintain proximity to additional apples, all while keeping your options open for future maneuvers.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **DOWN**\n\n---\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nAim to continue collecting nearby apples at (3, 5) and explore paths that keep you clear of the enemy snake's territory.
