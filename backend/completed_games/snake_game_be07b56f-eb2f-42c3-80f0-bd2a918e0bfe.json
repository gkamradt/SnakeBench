The apples are located at:\n- (7, 7)\n- (5, 3)\n- (0, 7)\n- (3, 8)\n- (7, 4)\n\nCurrently, the snake's possible moves are:\n- UP to (9, 3)\n- DOWN to (9, 1)\n- LEFT to (8, 2)\n- RIGHT to (10, 2) (out of bounds - illegal)\n\nEvaluating the moves:\n1. UP (to (9, 3)): This move does not result in an apple. The position (9, 3) is empty.\n2. DOWN (to (9, 1)): This move also does not give an apple. The position (9, 1) is empty.\n3. LEFT (to (8, 2)): This move also does not result in an apple. The position (8, 2) is empty.\n\nNone of the possible moves will immediately yield an apple, as they are all empty.\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider the distances to the apples:\n- (7, 7) is 5 moves away (UP and LEFT).\n- (5, 3) is 4 moves away (UP and LEFT).\n- (0, 7) is 9 moves away (left across multiple coordinates).\n- (3, 8) is 6 moves away (UP and LEFT) and also not very beneficial since it\u2019s farther.\n- (7, 4) is 4 moves away (UP and LEFT).\n\nTo maximize future options, I need to keep myself in a position to head toward the apples without hitting a wall or an enemy snake. \n\nGiven these evaluations:\n- Moving LEFT to (8, 2) may give me options toward the left side and potentially towards apples at (7, 4) and (5, 3) on later turns.\n\nTherefore, I will move LEFT.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

I will move towards it and try to avoid running into the enemy snake #1 which is currently at (9, 2). After getting the apple, I'll assess the situation again and decide on the next move.\n\nRationale: The apple at (7, 4) is the closest apple to me, so moving towards it will be the most efficient use of my turn. I'll need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake #1, but as long as I move diagonally and then horizontally, I should be able to avoid it.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
