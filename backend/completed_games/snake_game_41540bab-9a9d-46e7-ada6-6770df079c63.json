After collecting these apples, the snake will have to change direction to avoid hitting the wall at the bottom of the board.\n\n5) The strategy should be to collect the apples in the 9th column as efficiently as possible, while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake moves towards the 9th column, the strategy will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n6) After collecting the apples at (9, 2) and (9, 1), the snake will likely be at (9, 0), at which point it will need to turn left or right to continue playing safely. The decision on which way to turn will depend on the enemy snake's position at that time.\n\n7) It is crucial to avoid moving towards the enemy snake's position and to keep the snake's body from blocking its own path, which could lead to an accidental collision and loss of the game.\n\nBased on the above rationale, the next move should be: DOWN to continue towards the apple at (9, 2)."

After collecting these apples, the snake will have to change direction to avoid hitting the wall at the bottom of the board.\n\n5) The strategy should be to collect the apples in the 9th column as efficiently as possible, while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake moves towards the 9th column, the strategy will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n6) After collecting the apples at (9, 2) and (9, 1), the snake will likely be at (9, 0), at which point it will need to turn left or right to continue playing safely.
