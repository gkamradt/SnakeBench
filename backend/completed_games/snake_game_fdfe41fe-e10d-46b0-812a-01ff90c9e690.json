I've just consumed an apple and now I need to decide my next move while considering my goal of collecting more apples.\n\n### Remaining Apples:\nThe remaining apples are located at (9, 3), (5, 7), (0, 9), (0, 4), and importantly, also keeping an eye on the enemies, especially the immediate threat from Snake #1 at (5, 8).\n\n### Possible Moves from (2, 5):\n1. **UP to (2, 6)**: This move does not lead directly to an apple but keeps me within a vertical column.\n2. **DOWN to (2, 4)**: Invalid, as I cannot move back into my own body.\n3. **LEFT to (1, 5)**: This takes me away from the direction of any apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 5)**: However, I cannot move to (3, 5) since this is where my head currently is.\n\n### Current Threat Assessment:\nSince Snake #1 is at (5, 8), moving vertically up (to (2, 6)) could safely prevent me from getting into a position where I may be cornered or attacked by the enemy snakes. Moreover, I am moving towards gathering intel for future moves. \n\n### Strategic Rationale:\nMoving UP to (2, 6) is the only safe option concerning the rules involved. It opens up further movement options for the next turn without moving into my own body or a wall, and provides the ability to explore other sections of the board.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the situation, it seems prudent to move UP to (2, 6) and look for further opportunities to consume apples while ensuring my snake's safety.\n\n**Next move decision: UP.**"
