DOWN \u2192 Moving to (3,6)\n\u2003\u2013 Manhattan distance: |3 \u2013 2| + |6 \u2013 6| = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\u2003\u2013 This move reduces the Manhattan distance to 1.\n\n3. LEFT \u2192 Moving to (2,7)\n\u2003\u2013 Manhattan distance: |2 \u2013 2| + |7 \u2013 6| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\u2003\u2013 This move also reduces the Manhattan distance to 1, and it immediately aligns our x coordinate with the apple\u2019s x coordinate.\n\nNow let\u2019s check for hazards:\n\u2003\u2022 UP takes us further away and doesn\u2019t offer any immediate benefit.\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN moves us into (3,6), which is safe; the board shows no obstacles at that coordinate.\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT moves us to (2,7), also a safe and clear square.\n\u2003\u2022 Our enemy snake at (6,3) (with body at (5,3)) is far away from any of these moves.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT\u2014both leading to a Manhattan distance of 1\u2014moving LEFT has an extra strategic advantage. It immediately matches our x coordinate with that of the apple, making it more straightforward to complete the approach by the next move.\n\nTherefore, I decide that the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
