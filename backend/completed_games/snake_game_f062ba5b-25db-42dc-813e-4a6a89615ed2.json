            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is at position (9,8), which is on the bottom row, eighth column. There are apples at (8,7), (7,9), (9,3), (7,7), and (9,4). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position. Let's plot this out mentally. The grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\nSo, I'm at (9,8). Apples are at:\n\n- (8,7): one row up, one column left\n\n- (7,9): two rows up, same column\n\n- (9,3): same row, five columns left\n\n- (7,7): two rows up, one column left\n\n- (9,4): same row, four columns left\n\nI also need to be aware of the enemy snake, Snake #2, which is at (8,9). It doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's just its head at that position.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan a path to the apples without colliding with the enemy snake or myself.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n\n- If I go UP from (9,8) to (8,8), I'm moving towards the apples at (8,7) and (7,9), but I need to make sure not to bump into Snake #2 at (8,9).\n\n- If I go LEFT from (9,8) to (9,7), I'm moving towards the apples at (9,4) and (8,7), but I need to see if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\n- I could also consider moving DOWN to (9,9), but that's outside the grid, so that's a wall. Wait, no, (9,9) is within the grid as per the coordinates given (0-9 for both x and y).\n\nWait, let's clarify the grid boundaries. The grid goes from (0,0) to (9,9), so (9,9) is the top-right corner. So moving DOWN from (9,8) would be to (9,9), which is allowed.\n\nBut, looking back at the board state you provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A 2 .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A A .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my snake is at (9,8), which is row 8, column 9.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. In the board state, row 9 is the bottom row, column 0 to 9. So position (9,8) is row 9, column 8.\n\nBut in the description, it says coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So (9,8) is one row below the top, second from the right.\n\nApples are at (8,7), (7,9), (9,3), (7,7), (9,4).\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (8,9), which is one row up and one column to the right of my position.\n\nOkay, with that clarification, let's proceed.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should choose the one that's closest or that can lead me to others efficiently.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (9,8):\n\n- To (8,7): horizontal distance 1 (left), vertical distance 1 (up). Total steps: 2.\n\n- To (7,9): horizontal distance 2 (up), vertical distance 1 (right). Total steps: 3.\n\n- To (9,3): horizontal distance 5 (left). Total steps: 5.\n\n- To (7,7): horizontal distance 2 (up), vertical distance 1 (left). Total steps: 3.\n\n- To (9,4): horizontal distance 4 (left). Total steps: 4.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,7), requiring only two steps.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in that path. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is on the way if I move up to (8,8) and then left to (8,7).\n\nWait, if I move up to (8,8), I'm moving towards the enemy snake at (8,9). I need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nGiven that snakes can only move to adjacent cells, if Snake #2 is at (8,9), and I move to (8,8), it might move left to (8,8) in the next turn, but I'm not sure about its movement pattern.\n\nAssuming it will move down to (9,9), or left to (8,8), I need to anticipate its possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple to avoid potential conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (9,4), which is on the same row as my current position. I can move left directly to it, passing through (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in this path. According to the board state, there are no other snakes or my own body parts in the way since it's my first move.\n\nWait, but in the board state, at row 9, column 8 is my snake, column 7 is empty, column 6 is empty, etc., up to column 4 where there's an apple.\n\nSo, moving left from (9,8) to (9,7), then (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nBut, by eating the apple at (9,4), I grow in length, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, on the next move, I need to continue moving without hitting my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move left to (9,7), my tail remains at (9,8).\n\nThen, if I move to (9,6), my tail moves to (9,7), and so on.\n\nSeems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, going for the closer apple at (8,7) might be faster, but riskier due to the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the points.\n\nEach apple gives me 1 point, and the goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to collect as many apples as possible without taking unnecessary risks.\n\nTherefore, maybe going for the apple at (9,4) is safer, as it's on the same row with no obstacles.\n\nAfter eating that, I can consider moving up to collect more apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to collect multiple apples in one path efficiently.\n\nLet's see, starting at (9,8), move left to (9,4) to eat the apple there, then move up to (8,4), then maybe diagonally up-left or up-right to reach other apples.\n\nBut looking at the positions, the apples are at (8,7), (7,9), (7,7), and (9,3).\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I could move up to (8,4), then left to (8,3), then up to (7,3), then right to (7,7) to eat another apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted and time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,4), I could move up to (8,4), then right to (8,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (8,9), and if I move to (8,4), it might move towards me or away, depending on its behavior.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I need to assume it could be aggressive or defensive.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (9,3), which is further left on the same row.\n\nThat would involve moving left from (9,8) to (9,3), eating the apple, and then considering moving up to collect other apples.\n\nBut (9,3) is another apple, so I need to make sure I don't overshoot and leave other apples unreachable.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (8,7), which is closer, but as mentioned, there's the risk of the enemy snake at (8,9).\n\nWait, perhaps I can predict the enemy snake's movement.\n\nIf it's at (8,9), and I move to (8,8), the enemy might move left to (8,8), which would collide with me, killing both snakes.\n\nBut in such a case, perhaps it's better to"
