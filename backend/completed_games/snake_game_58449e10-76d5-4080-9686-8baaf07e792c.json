            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (8,3) with no body.\n\nLast move was UP, which took me from (2,4) to (2,5). Now, I need to decide the next direction. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: Moving to (2,6). There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4). Next move, if I go up again, I can't go back down because that's where my body is. But maybe there's another apple. Wait, (2,6) is already an apple, so moving there would take it. But after that, the next apple in that line is not listed. Wait, the apples listed are (2,6), so that's the one. So moving up now would get that apple. But I need to check if that's safe.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (8,3). They are far away from me, so no immediate collision risk. The board seems clear. Let's check the positions. My head is at (2,5). Moving up to (2,6) is valid. The next position after that would be (2,6), and the body would follow. So that's safe.\n\nOther directions: LEFT to (1,5). Is there an apple there? No. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), etc. So moving left doesn't get me an apple. But maybe it's a path towards another apple. But (6,1) is far. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nRIGHT to (3,5). No apple there. Then I'd have to move towards other apples. But that's moving away from the current apple at (2,6).\n\nDOWN to (2,4). But that's where my body is. If I go down, I'd collide with my own body. That's a death. So DOWN is not allowed.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But UP leads to an apple. So that's the best choice. But wait, after moving up to (2,6), the next move would have to avoid going back down to (2,5) because that's where the body would be. But that's a future problem. For now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nSo the best move is UP. That gives me a point and grows the snake. The enemy is not in the way. No walls here since (2,6) is within the 0-9 range. So UP is safe and beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient.

Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions.

The apples are located at (6, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (2, 9), and (5, 8). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

          "2": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are located at (6, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (2, 9), and (5, 8). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

But I need to check if there's any obstacle. The board shows that at (2,9) there's an apple, so that's safe. The path from (2,7) to (2,8) to (2,9) seems clear. No snakes or walls in that path. After eating the apple, my body will grow, so I need to make sure I don't trap myself. But for now, moving UP seems good.\n\nDOWN: That would take me to (2,6), which is part of my body. That's a collision, so DOWN is not an option.\n\nLEFT: Moving to (1,7). There's no apple there. It's a safe move, but not helpful for points. Maybe to avoid the enemy, but the enemy is at (9,4), which is far away. Not sure if necessary.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (3,7). No apple here. Could head towards the apple at (5,8) or (7,2). But (5,8) is up and right. From (3,7), moving UP to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), etc. But that's a longer path. The apple at (7,2) is down and right.

They might be moving towards their own apples. So probably not a threat to me immediately.\n\nSo the best move is UP again to head towards the apple at (2,9).

But next turn, after moving to (2,8), the next move would be UP to (2,9) to get the apple, then I can decide to go left or right from there.

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (2, 6) with the body segments at [(2, 5), (2, 4)]. The apples are located at (6, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (2, 9), and (5, 8). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake is at (9,4) with a body at (8,4). Last move I went UP, which took me to (2,7). Now I need to decide the next direction.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nUP: Moving to (2,8). That's towards the apple at (2,9). If I go UP again next turn, I can reach the apple. But I need to check if there's any obstacle. The board shows that at (2,9) there's an apple, so that's safe. The path from (2,7) to (2,8) to (2,9) seems clear. No snakes or walls in that path. After eating the apple, my body will grow, so I need to make sure I don't trap myself. But for now, moving UP seems good.\n\nDOWN: That would take me to (2,6), which is part of my body. That's a collision, so DOWN is not an option.\n\nLEFT: Moving to (1,7). There's no apple there. It's a safe move, but not helpful for points. Maybe to avoid the enemy, but the enemy is at (9,4), which is far away. Not sure if necessary.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (3,7). No apple here. Could head towards the apple at (5,8) or (7,2). But (5,8) is up and right. From (3,7), moving UP to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), etc. But that's a longer path. The apple at (7,2) is down and right. Maybe not the best direction right now.\n\nThe closest apple is (2,9) two steps up. Going UP now would get me closer. The enemy snake is at (9,4), which is on the right side. They might be moving towards their own apples. So probably not a threat to me immediately.\n\nSo the best move is UP again to head towards the apple at (2,9). Need to make sure that after eating it, I can turn left or right to avoid hitting my own body. But next turn, after moving to (2,8), the next move would be UP to (2,9) to get the apple, then I can decide to go left or right from there.

The enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at [(9,5), (9,4)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current head is at (2,9). Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4). Next move, if I go up again, I can't go back down because that's where my body is. But maybe there's another apple. Wait, (2,6) is already an apple, so moving there would take it.

My head is at (2,5). Moving up to (2,6) is valid. The next position after that would be (2,6), and the body would follow. So that's safe.\n\nOther directions: LEFT to (1,5). Is there an apple there? No. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), etc. So moving left doesn't get me an apple. But maybe it's a path towards another apple. But (6,1) is far. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nRIGHT to (3,5). No apple there. Then I'd have to move towards other apples. But that's moving away from the current apple at (2,6).\n\nDOWN to (2,4). But that's where my body is. If I go down, I'd collide with my own body. That's a death. So DOWN is not allowed.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But UP leads to an apple. So that's the best choice.

For now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nSo the best move is UP. That gives me a point and grows the snake. The enemy is not in the way. No walls here since (2,6) is within the 0-9 range.

The apples are located at (6, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (2, 9), and (5, 8). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at [(9,5), (9,4)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current head is at (2,9). Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (3,9) with the body segments at [(2,9), (2,8), (2,7)]. The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (5,8), (2,3), and (7,4). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,6) with body parts at [(9,6), (9,5)]. The board is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (3,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3,9) would take me to (3,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (3,8). Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4).

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising.

This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

But I need to check if there's any obstacle. The board shows that at (2,9) there's an apple, so that's safe. The path from (2,7) to (2,8) to (2,9) seems clear. No snakes or walls in that path. After eating the apple, my body will grow, so I need to make sure I don't trap myself. But for now, moving UP seems good.\n\nDOWN: That would take me to (2,6), which is part of my body. That's a collision, so DOWN is not an option.\n\nLEFT: Moving to (1,7). There's no apple there. It's a safe move, but not helpful for points. Maybe to avoid the enemy, but the enemy is at (9,4), which is far away. Not sure if necessary.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (3,7). No apple here. Could head towards the apple at (5,8) or (7,2). But (5,8) is up and right. From (3,7), moving UP to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), etc. But that's a longer path. The apple at (7,2) is down and right. Maybe not the best direction right now.\n\nThe closest apple is (2,9) two steps up. Going UP now would get me closer. The enemy snake is at (9,4), which is on the right side. They might be moving towards their own apples. So probably not a threat to me immediately.\n\nSo the best move is UP again to head towards the apple at (2,9). Need to make sure that after eating it, I can turn left or right to avoid hitting my own body. But next turn, after moving to (2,8), the next move would be UP to (2,9) to get the apple, then I can decide to go left or right from there. Since my body will grow, the tail will follow, so I need to plan the path after eating the apple. But for now, moving UP is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nUP"

If I go UP, I can eat the apple, grow, and gain a point. The path is clear since (2,9) is an apple and not occupied by any snake. After eating, my new head would be at (2,9), and the body would extend, so the next move needs to avoid backtracking into the new tail. This seems beneficial.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (2,7).

No immediate benefit, but it avoids the enemy. However, moving away from the nearby apple might not be optimal.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (3,8). Also empty.

After eating the apple, my next move would need to avoid moving back down into the new body segment. Possible directions next turn would be LEFT or RIGHT from (2,9) to start circling or heading towards another apple.\n\nStrategy: Secure the nearest apple first, then plan a path towards the next closest (maybe (5,8) or (7,2)) while avoiding self-collision and the enemy.

The enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at [(9,5), (9,4)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current head is at (2,9). Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (5,8), (2,3), and (7,4). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,6) with body parts at [(9,6), (9,5)]. The board is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (3,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3,9) would take me to (3,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (3,8). Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4). Next move, if I go up again, I can't go back down because that's where my body is. But maybe there's another apple. Wait, (2,6) is already an apple, so moving there would take it.

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (5,8), (2,3), and (7,4). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,6) with body parts at [(9,6), (9,5)]. The board is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (3,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3,9) would take me to (3,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (3,8). Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple.

But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4).

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (5,8), (2,3), and (7,4). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,6) with body parts at [(9,6), (9,5)]. The board is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (3,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3,9) would take me to (3,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (3,8). Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Wait, my snake's body includes (3,9) and (2,9), so (4,9) is empty. But wait, the board's row 9 shows \". . T T . . . . . .\", so columns 2 and 3 are T's. So (4,9) is empty.

Row 9 has T's at (2,9) and (3,9), which are part of my body. (5,9) is empty. So moving up is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: (5,7). Looking at the board, row 7 has enemy snake parts at (7,7) and (7,6).

Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) could start a path towards lower rows. Moving UP to (5,9) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there, but there isn't.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving down to (5,7) then right towards (6,7), etc., could get closer. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down might be a path. \n\nBut need to avoid the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6). Their body is at (7,7) and (7,6), so moving towards column 7 might be risky. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but (6,7) is empty. Then continue down towards the apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc., towards (8,6). \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the tail is at (2,9). So when moving, the tail will follow. The next move's tail will be at (3,9) if I move, so the body segments will shift. So the new body after moving would be [new head, (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9)]. The tail is at (3,9) now. So avoiding that area.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the safest path. Moving right to (6,8) seems safe. Then from there, maybe down to (6,7), which is empty. Then further down towards the apple at (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving down now to (5,7) and then right towards (6,7), which is also safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,9) might not be useful as there's no apple there, but it's a safe move. However, it's moving away from the remaining apples. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,8) with body parts [(7,7), (7,6)]. So if I move towards column 7, I need to be cautious. But (7,8) is their head. If I move towards (6,8), then (7,8) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (7,8), so moving to (6,8) is adjacent but not directly into them. They might move towards me, but I can't predict their moves. \n\nSo safest options are RIGHT to (6,8) or DOWN to (5,7). Let's evaluate which path leads closer to apples. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. From (5,8), moving down would get closer. If I go down to (5,7), then further down to (5,6), etc., towards row 4. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down through columns 6-7. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving right to (6,8), then right again to (7,8) would be dangerous because the enemy's head is there. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), (7,7) is enemy's body part. So (7,7) is occupied. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm. So moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7) is possible, but (7,7) is enemy's body. So maybe not the best path. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), etc., towards (7,4). That path avoids the enemy snake. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then left to (4,7), but that's moving away from apples. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,8) is better, as it opens a path towards the right side where apples are. But need to check if (6,8) is safe. The board shows that row 8 has my snake's head at (5,8) and the enemy's head at (7,8). So (6,8) is empty. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,8) seems safe and positions me closer to the apples in columns 7 and 8. Next move from (6,8) could be DOWN to (6,7), then towards (7,4) or (8,6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving towards the right might be riskier if the enemy is moving towards me. But since I can't predict their moves, I have to choose the safest path. \n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's check for immediate dangers. \n\nRIGHT to (6,8): safe. \n\nDOWN to (5,7): safe. \n\nWhich direction leads to more apples? The apple at (7,4) is in row 4, column 7. From (5,8), moving down would get me closer. But moving right first might allow a diagonal approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent to that. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4). That path is possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now to (6,8) seems like a step towards that path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut perhaps RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's blocked. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, from (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's a dead end. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7) is better. Then from (5,7), moving right to (6,7), but (7,7) is enemy's body. So (6,7) is safe, but then next move could be down to (6,6), etc. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right towards (6,6), (7,6) is enemy's body. So again, blocked. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (7,4). To get there, moving down and right would be needed. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,3) is on the left side, but that's far from my current position. \n\nSo perhaps the best move is RIGHT to (6,8), then proceed down towards row 4. \n\nBut I need to ensure that moving RIGHT doesn't box me in. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) to start descending. \n\nGiven that both RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but RIGHT might lead towards more apples, I'll choose RIGHT. \n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (6,8), the next move would have to avoid (5,8) which is part of my body. So from (6,8), possible moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT would go back to (5,8), which is now part of my body. So that's a collision. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now would require that next move I can't go left. But that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now allows more flexibility. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN is safer to start moving towards the lower rows where apples are. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (7,8), moving RIGHT to (6,8) is adjacent to their head. If they move left to (6,8), we could collide. But since I can't predict their move, it's a risk. \n\nBut the enemy's body is at (7,7) and (7,6). Their head is at (7,8). So if they move left to (6,8), that's possible. But if I move there now, and they also move there, we both die. \n\nThat's a risk. So maybe moving DOWN is safer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) avoids that risk. \n\nSo perhaps DOWN is better. \n\nBut then, from (5,7), I can move right to (6,7), which is safe. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then down to (5,6), etc. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. So moving down from (5,8) to (5,7), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), then right to (7,4). That's a possible path. \n\nBut that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc. \n\nBut again, the enemy's presence complicates things. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. \n\nGiven that moving RIGHT could risk collision with the enemy if they move left, but moving DOWN is safer and starts a path downward, I think DOWN might be the better choice here. \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN to (5,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4).

The apples are located at (6, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (2, 9), and (5, 8). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Maybe not the best direction right now.\n\nThe closest apple is (2,9) two steps up. Going UP now would get me closer. The enemy snake is at (9,4), which is on the right side. They might be moving towards their own apples. So probably not a threat to me immediately.\n\nSo the best move is UP again to head towards the apple at (2,9). Need to make sure that after eating it, I can turn left or right to avoid hitting my own body. But next turn, after moving to (2,8), the next move would be UP to (2,9) to get the apple, then I can decide to go left or right from there. Since my body will grow, the tail will follow, so I need to plan the path after eating the apple. But for now, moving UP is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nUP"

If I go UP, I can eat the apple, grow, and gain a point. The path is clear since (2,9) is an apple and not occupied by any snake. After eating, my new head would be at (2,9), and the body would extend, so the next move needs to avoid backtracking into the new tail. This seems beneficial.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (2,7).

The enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at [(9,5), (9,4)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current head is at (2,9). Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (5,8), (2,3), and (7,4). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,6) with body parts at [(9,6), (9,5)]. The board is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (3,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3,9) would take me to (3,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (3,8). Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (5,8) after moving right to eat the apple there. Now, the body is [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. The next move needs to avoid colliding with myself or the enemy snake.\n\nPossible directions from (5,8):\n\n- **UP**: (5,9). Check the board. Row 9 has T's at (2,9) and (3,9), which are part of my body. (5,9) is empty. So moving up is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: (5,7). Looking at the board, row 7 has enemy snake parts at (7,7) and (7,6). (5,7) is empty. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: (4,8). That's part of my body (the next segment). Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\n- **RIGHT**: (6,8). Check the board. The cell (6,8) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Now, where are the apples? The remaining apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (8,6). The closest ones are (7,4) and (8,6). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,8), that's moving towards the right edge. From there, maybe head down towards (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) could start a path towards lower rows. Moving UP to (5,9) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there, but there isn't.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving down to (5,7) then right towards (6,7), etc., could get closer. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down might be a path. \n\nBut need to avoid the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6). Their body is at (7,7) and (7,6), so moving towards column 7 might be risky. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but (6,7) is empty. Then continue down towards the apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc., towards (8,6). \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the tail is at (2,9). So when moving, the tail will follow. The next move's tail will be at (3,9) if I move, so the body segments will shift. So the new body after moving would be [new head, (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9)]. The tail is at (3,9) now. So avoiding that area.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the safest path. Moving right to (6,8) seems safe. Then from there, maybe down to (6,7), which is empty. Then further down towards the apple at (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving down now to (5,7) and then right towards (6,7), which is also safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,9) might not be useful as there's no apple there, but it's a safe move. However, it's moving away from the remaining apples. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,8) with body parts [(7,7), (7,6)]. So if I move towards column 7, I need to be cautious. But (7,8) is their head. If I move towards (6,8), then (7,8) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (7,8), so moving to (6,8) is adjacent but not directly into them. They might move towards me, but I can't predict their moves. \n\nSo safest options are RIGHT to (6,8) or DOWN to (5,7). Let's evaluate which path leads closer to apples. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. From (5,8), moving down would get closer. If I go down to (5,7), then further down to (5,6), etc., towards row 4. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down through columns 6-7. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving right to (6,8), then right again to (7,8) would be dangerous because the enemy's head is there. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), (7,7) is enemy's body part. So (7,7) is occupied. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm. So moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7) is possible, but (7,7) is enemy's body. So maybe not the best path. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), etc., towards (7,4). That path avoids the enemy snake. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then left to (4,7), but that's moving away from apples. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,8) is better, as it opens a path towards the right side where apples are. But need to check if (6,8) is safe. The board shows that row 8 has my snake's head at (5,8) and the enemy's head at (7,8). So (6,8) is empty. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,8) seems safe and positions me closer to the apples in columns 7 and 8. Next move from (6,8) could be DOWN to (6,7), then towards (7,4) or (8,6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving towards the right might be riskier if the enemy is moving towards me. But since I can't predict their moves, I have to choose the safest path. \n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's check for immediate dangers. \n\nRIGHT to (6,8): safe. \n\nDOWN to (5,7): safe. \n\nWhich direction leads to more apples? The apple at (7,4) is in row 4, column 7. From (5,8), moving down would get me closer. But moving right first might allow a diagonal approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent to that. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4). That path is possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now to (6,8) seems like a step towards that path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut perhaps RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's blocked. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, from (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's a dead end. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7) is better. Then from (5,7), moving right to (6,7), but (7,7) is enemy's body. So (6,7) is safe, but then next move could be down to (6,6), etc. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right towards (6,6), (7,6) is enemy's body. So again, blocked. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (7,4). To get there, moving down and right would be needed. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,3) is on the left side, but that's far from my current position. \n\nSo perhaps the best move is RIGHT to (6,8), then proceed down towards row 4. \n\nBut I need to ensure that moving RIGHT doesn't box me in. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) to start descending. \n\nGiven that both RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but RIGHT might lead towards more apples, I'll choose RIGHT. \n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (6,8), the next move would have to avoid (5,8) which is part of my body. So from (6,8), possible moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT would go back to (5,8), which is now part of my body. So that's a collision. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now would require that next move I can't go left. But that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now allows more flexibility. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN is safer to start moving towards the lower rows where apples are. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (7,8), moving RIGHT to (6,8) is adjacent to their head. If they move left to (6,8), we could collide. But since I can't predict their move, it's a risk. \n\nBut the enemy's body is at (7,7) and (7,6). Their head is at (7,8). So if they move left to (6,8), that's possible. But if I move there now, and they also move there, we both die. \n\nThat's a risk. So maybe moving DOWN is safer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) avoids that risk. \n\nSo perhaps DOWN is better. \n\nBut then, from (5,7), I can move right to (6,7), which is safe. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then down to (5,6), etc. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. So moving down from (5,8) to (5,7), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), then right to (7,4). That's a possible path. \n\nBut that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc. \n\nBut again, the enemy's presence complicates things. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. \n\nGiven that moving RIGHT could risk collision with the enemy if they move left, but moving DOWN is safer and starts a path downward, I think DOWN might be the better choice here. \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN to (5,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4). Next move, if I go up again, I can't go back down because that's where my body is. But maybe there's another apple. Wait, (2,6) is already an apple, so moving there would take it. But after that, the next apple in that line is not listed. Wait, the apples listed are (2,6), so that's the one. So moving up now would get that apple.

My head is at (2,5). Moving up to (2,6) is valid. The next position after that would be (2,6), and the body would follow. So that's safe.\n\nOther directions: LEFT to (1,5). Is there an apple there? No. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), etc. So moving left doesn't get me an apple. But maybe it's a path towards another apple. But (6,1) is far. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nRIGHT to (3,5). No apple there. Then I'd have to move towards other apples. But that's moving away from the current apple at (2,6).\n\nDOWN to (2,4). But that's where my body is. If I go down, I'd collide with my own body. That's a death. So DOWN is not allowed.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But UP leads to an apple. So that's the best choice.

For now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nSo the best move is UP. That gives me a point and grows the snake. The enemy is not in the way. No walls here since (2,6) is within the 0-9 range.

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at [(9,5), (9,4)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current head is at (2,9). Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

If I move RIGHT to (4,8), next move could be RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's efficient. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (3,7) would take me away from the apple. But maybe there's another path.\n\nWait, moving RIGHT to (4,8) gets me closer to the apple. Then next turn, moving RIGHT again would get the apple. That's good. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having my body at (2,8) and the apple at (5,8). So (4,8) is empty. Safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, I can reach the apple in the next move. That's a good plan. However, moving DOWN to (3,7) might open up more space for future moves, but it's moving away from the apple. The priority should be to collect apples quickly.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,8), my snake will grow by one segment. So the next move after eating would need to avoid the new tail.

Moving RIGHT once to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) would get the apple. So that's the plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,7) would take me further from the apple. Unless there's another apple nearby. The next closest apple is (2,3), but that's far. The apple at (7,4) is also a bit far. So prioritizing (5,8) is better.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), which is not near my current path.

The board shows that the apple at (5,8) is in row 8, which is the same row as my current head position.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,8). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,9). Looking at the board state, row 9 has a T (which I think represents a tail or part of a snake) at (2,9) and (3,9). Wait, my snake's body includes (3,9) and (2,9), so (4,9) is empty. But wait, the board's row 9 shows \". . T T . . . . . .\", so columns 2 and 3 are T's. So (4,9) is empty. But moving UP would take me to (4,9), which is safe. However, after moving, my body would be [(4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. So no collision here.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,7). Check the board: row 7 has the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6), but (4,7) is empty. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,8). That's part of my body (the first segment after the head). Collision with myself. Invalid.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,8). The apple is at (5,8). So moving RIGHT would collect the apple, grow by one segment, and gain a point. This seems like the best option.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (5,8). If I move RIGHT to (5,8), I eat the apple. That's good. But I need to check if that's a valid move. The board shows that (5,8) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. Moving there is allowed and beneficial.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (7,7). They are not near (5,8), so no immediate threat. Also, after eating the apple, my snake's length increases, so the next move will have to be careful not to run into the new tail. But for this turn, moving RIGHT to get the apple is the priority.\n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (4,9), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to any apples. The next closest apple after (5,8) is (7,4) or (2,3), which are further away. So moving RIGHT to eat the apple now is optimal.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,8), the next move would need to avoid the new tail. But since the growth happens after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately. So after moving to (5,8), the body becomes [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. The next move would need to avoid (4,8) if possible, but that's a future consideration.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (5,8) to collect the apple, gain a point, and grow.

The next move needs to avoid colliding with myself or the enemy snake.\n\nPossible directions from (5,8):\n\n- **UP**: (5,9). Check the board. Row 9 has T's at (2,9) and (3,9), which are part of my body. (5,9) is empty. So moving up is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: (5,7). Looking at the board, row 7 has enemy snake parts at (7,7) and (7,6). (5,7) is empty. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: (4,8). That's part of my body (the next segment). Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\n- **RIGHT**: (6,8). Check the board. The cell (6,8) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Now, where are the apples? The remaining apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (8,6). The closest ones are (7,4) and (8,6). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,8), that's moving towards the right edge. From there, maybe head down towards (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) could start a path towards lower rows. Moving UP to (5,9) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there, but there isn't.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving down to (5,7) then right towards (6,7), etc., could get closer. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down might be a path. \n\nBut need to avoid the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6). Their body is at (7,7) and (7,6), so moving towards column 7 might be risky. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but (6,7) is empty. Then continue down towards the apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc., towards (8,6). \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the tail is at (2,9). So when moving, the tail will follow. The next move's tail will be at (3,9) if I move, so the body segments will shift. So the new body after moving would be [new head, (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9)]. The tail is at (3,9) now. So avoiding that area.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the safest path. Moving right to (6,8) seems safe. Then from there, maybe down to (6,7), which is empty. Then further down towards the apple at (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving down now to (5,7) and then right towards (6,7), which is also safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,9) might not be useful as there's no apple there, but it's a safe move. However, it's moving away from the remaining apples. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,8) with body parts [(7,7), (7,6)]. So if I move towards column 7, I need to be cautious. But (7,8) is their head. If I move towards (6,8), then (7,8) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (7,8), so moving to (6,8) is adjacent but not directly into them. They might move towards me, but I can't predict their moves. \n\nSo safest options are RIGHT to (6,8) or DOWN to (5,7). Let's evaluate which path leads closer to apples. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. From (5,8), moving down would get closer. If I go down to (5,7), then further down to (5,6), etc., towards row 4. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down through columns 6-7. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving right to (6,8), then right again to (7,8) would be dangerous because the enemy's head is there. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), (7,7) is enemy's body part. So (7,7) is occupied. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm. So moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7) is possible, but (7,7) is enemy's body. So maybe not the best path. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), etc., towards (7,4). That path avoids the enemy snake. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then left to (4,7), but that's moving away from apples. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,8) is better, as it opens a path towards the right side where apples are. But need to check if (6,8) is safe. The board shows that row 8 has my snake's head at (5,8) and the enemy's head at (7,8). So (6,8) is empty. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,8) seems safe and positions me closer to the apples in columns 7 and 8. Next move from (6,8) could be DOWN to (6,7), then towards (7,4) or (8,6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving towards the right might be riskier if the enemy is moving towards me. But since I can't predict their moves, I have to choose the safest path. \n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's check for immediate dangers. \n\nRIGHT to (6,8): safe. \n\nDOWN to (5,7): safe. \n\nWhich direction leads to more apples? The apple at (7,4) is in row 4, column 7. From (5,8), moving down would get me closer. But moving right first might allow a diagonal approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent to that. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4). That path is possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now to (6,8) seems like a step towards that path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut perhaps RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's blocked. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, from (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's a dead end. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7) is better. Then from (5,7), moving right to (6,7), but (7,7) is enemy's body. So (6,7) is safe, but then next move could be down to (6,6), etc. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right towards (6,6), (7,6) is enemy's body. So again, blocked. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (7,4). To get there, moving down and right would be needed. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,3) is on the left side, but that's far from my current position. \n\nSo perhaps the best move is RIGHT to (6,8), then proceed down towards row 4. \n\nBut I need to ensure that moving RIGHT doesn't box me in. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) to start descending. \n\nGiven that both RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but RIGHT might lead towards more apples, I'll choose RIGHT. \n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (6,8), the next move would have to avoid (5,8) which is part of my body. So from (6,8), possible moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT would go back to (5,8), which is now part of my body. So that's a collision. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now would require that next move I can't go left. But that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now allows more flexibility. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN is safer to start moving towards the lower rows where apples are. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (7,8), moving RIGHT to (6,8) is adjacent to their head. If they move left to (6,8), we could collide. But since I can't predict their move, it's a risk. \n\nBut the enemy's body is at (7,7) and (7,6). Their head is at (7,8). So if they move left to (6,8), that's possible. But if I move there now, and they also move there, we both die. \n\nThat's a risk. So maybe moving DOWN is safer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) avoids that risk. \n\nSo perhaps DOWN is better. \n\nBut then, from (5,7), I can move right to (6,7), which is safe. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then down to (5,6), etc. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. So moving down from (5,8) to (5,7), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), then right to (7,4). That's a possible path. \n\nBut that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc. \n\nBut again, the enemy's presence complicates things. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. \n\nGiven that moving RIGHT could risk collision with the enemy if they move left, but moving DOWN is safer and starts a path downward, I think DOWN might be the better choice here. \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN to (5,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,8) with body parts [(7,8), (7,7)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,7). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,8). But looking at the snake's body, (5,8) is the next segment. Colliding with myself. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,6). Check the board. The cell (5,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,7). Check the board. (4,7) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,7). Check the board. (6,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Now, considering the goal to reach apples and avoid danger.\n\nApples closest to current position (5,7) are (7,4) and (8,6). Moving RIGHT towards (6,7) could be a step towards those. Moving DOWN to (5,6) might lead towards lower rows where (7,4) is. Moving LEFT to (4,7) takes me away from the apples.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,8). Their body is at (7,8) and (7,7). Moving RIGHT to (6,7) is adjacent to (7,7), which is the enemy's body. If the enemy moves towards (6,7), there's a risk. However, since we can't predict their move, need to proceed cautiously.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) avoids immediate threats and starts a path towards (7,4). From (5,6), next moves could be RIGHT towards (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., approaching (7,4).\n\nLEFT to (4,7) moves away from apples, so less optimal.\n\nConsidering safety and proximity to apples, moving DOWN to (5,6) seems safer and progresses towards the apple at (7,4). Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,7) is closer to apples but near the enemy's body. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,6), the tail (3,9) will shift as the snake moves, so the body segments will be [(5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)], avoiding self-collision.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move is DOWN to (5,6), progressing towards the apple at (7,4) while avoiding immediate threats.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake #1 is at (8,7) with body parts [(8,8), (7,8)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,6). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,7). But that's the first body segment. Collision with myself. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,5). Check the board. (5,5) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,6). Check the board. (4,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,6). The apple at (8,6) is two columns to the right, but (6,6) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Now, considering the goal to reach apples and avoid danger.\n\nThe closest apples are (7,4) and (8,6). Moving RIGHT towards (6,6) gets me closer to (8,6). From (6,6), next moves could be RIGHT again towards (7,6), then down to (7,5), (7,4). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) might lead towards (7,4) by going right and down. Moving LEFT to (4,6) takes me away from the apples.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). Their body is at (8,8) and (7,8). Moving RIGHT to (6,6) is still a few steps away from the enemy. The enemy's head is at (8,7), so they might move towards the apple at (8,6). If I move towards (8,6), there's a potential collision risk if the enemy also goes there. But maybe I can reach it first.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) could be safer, but it's moving away from the apples. However, (7,4) is in the lower right. From (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then (7,5), then down to (7,4). That path might work.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,4) is closer in terms of steps. From (5,6), moving RIGHT to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5), then RIGHT to (6,5), (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). Also four moves. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be more direct. However, the enemy's position is at (8,7). If they move LEFT to (7,7), they could block my path. But since their body is at (8,8) and (7,8), they might be moving to avoid their own tail.\n\nAlso, need to check if moving RIGHT to (6,6) is safe. The cell (6,6) is empty. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (7,6), which is adjacent to the enemy's head at (8,7). That might be risky. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) keeps me further from the enemy.\n\nAnother apple is at (7,2), which is further down. But (7,4) is closer. Maybe prioritize (7,4).\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is two steps right from (6,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so moving towards (8,6) might lead to a head-on collision if the enemy moves down to (8,6). \n\nHmm. Maybe safer to go for (7,4). So from (5,6), moving RIGHT to (6,6) is a step towards (7,4). Then next move could be RIGHT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). But need to check if (7,6) is safe. The enemy's body is at (7,8), so (7,6) is two cells down from there. Maybe safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) and then RIGHT. Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (6,6)\nOption 2: DOWN to (5,5)\nOption 3: LEFT to (4,6) \u2013 not useful as it moves away.\n\nOption 1 seems better for reaching apples. But need to check for any immediate dangers. The enemy's head is at (8,7). If they move LEFT to (7,7), that's adjacent to (7,6), which I might reach in two moves. But that's a possible risk. However, since we can't predict their move, maybe proceed with caution.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) avoids any immediate conflict and starts a path towards (7,4). From (5,5), next move could be RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). That path is safe and avoids the enemy's area.\n\nConsidering safety, moving DOWN to (5,5) might be better. Then, proceed right. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now could be more efficient but riskier. Since the enemy is nearby, maybe prioritize safety.\n\nAnother point: the snake's tail is at (3,8). When moving, the tail will shift, so the body segments will be [(5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8)]. No self-collision in any case.\n\nSo, the safest move is DOWN to (5,5), then plan to move right towards the apple. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,6) is more direct but closer to the enemy. Given the uncertainty, perhaps safer to go DOWN first.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (8,3) with no body.\n\nLast move was UP, which took me from (2,4) to (2,5). Now, I need to decide the next direction. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: Moving to (2,6). There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4). Next move, if I go up again, I can't go back down because that's where my body is. But maybe there's another apple. Wait, (2,6) is already an apple, so moving there would take it.

No. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), etc. So moving left doesn't get me an apple. But maybe it's a path towards another apple. But (6,1) is far. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nRIGHT to (3,5). No apple there. Then I'd have to move towards other apples. But that's moving away from the current apple at (2,6).\n\nDOWN to (2,4). But that's where my body is.

For now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nSo the best move is UP. That gives me a point and grows the snake. The enemy is not in the way. No walls here since (2,6) is within the 0-9 range.

The apples are located at (6, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (2, 9), and (5, 8). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Maybe to avoid the enemy, but the enemy is at (9,4), which is far away. Not sure if necessary.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (3,7). No apple here. Could head towards the apple at (5,8) or (7,2).

The enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at [(9,5), (9,4)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current head is at (2,9). Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The board is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (3,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3,9) would take me to (3,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (3,8). Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The board shows row 8 as having my body at (2,8) and the apple at (5,8). So (4,8) is empty. Safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, I can reach the apple in the next move. That's a good plan. However, moving DOWN to (3,7) might open up more space for future moves, but it's moving away from the apple. The priority should be to collect apples quickly.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,8), my snake will grow by one segment. So the next move after eating would need to avoid the new tail. But since the growth happens after eating, the immediate next move after eating would just extend the body.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now is the best option to get the apple quickly. Then next turn, I can decide to go further right to (5,8) and eat it. Wait, no\u2014if I move RIGHT now to (4,8), then next turn, moving RIGHT again to (5,8) would collect the apple. That's two moves. But wait, the apple is at (5,8). So from (3,8), moving RIGHT twice would reach it. But the current position is (3,8). Moving RIGHT once to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) would get the apple. So that's the plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,7) would take me further from the apple. Unless there's another apple nearby. The next closest apple is (2,3), but that's far. The apple at (7,4) is also a bit far. So prioritizing (5,8) is better.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), which is not near my current path. So no immediate threat from them.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,8), setting up to collect the apple at (5,8) next turn. This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently targets the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples available are at (6,1), (7,2), (5,8), (2,3), and (7,4). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7,7) with body parts [(7,6), (8,6)]. The board shows that the apple at (5,8) is in row 8, which is the same row as my current head position.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,8). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,9). Looking at the board state, row 9 has a T (which I think represents a tail or part of a snake) at (2,9) and (3,9). Wait, my snake's body includes (3,9) and (2,9), so (4,9) is empty. But wait, the board's row 9 shows \". . T T . . . . . .\", so columns 2 and 3 are T's. So (4,9) is empty. But moving UP would take me to (4,9), which is safe. However, after moving, my body would be [(4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. So no collision here.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,7). Check the board: row 7 has the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6), but (4,7) is empty. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,8). That's part of my body (the first segment after the head). Collision with myself. Invalid.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,8). The apple is at (5,8). So moving RIGHT would collect the apple, grow by one segment, and gain a point. This seems like the best option.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (5,8). If I move RIGHT to (5,8), I eat the apple. That's good. But I need to check if that's a valid move. The board shows that (5,8) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. Moving there is allowed and beneficial.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (7,7). They are not near (5,8), so no immediate threat. Also, after eating the apple, my snake's length increases, so the next move will have to be careful not to run into the new tail. But for this turn, moving RIGHT to get the apple is the priority.\n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (4,9), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to any apples. The next closest apple after (5,8) is (7,4) or (2,3), which are further away. So moving RIGHT to eat the apple now is optimal.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,8), the next move would need to avoid the new tail. But since the growth happens after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately. So after moving to (5,8), the body becomes [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. The next move would need to avoid (4,8) if possible, but that's a future consideration.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (5,8) to collect the apple, gain a point, and grow.

The next move needs to avoid colliding with myself or the enemy snake.\n\nPossible directions from (5,8):\n\n- **UP**: (5,9). Check the board. Row 9 has T's at (2,9) and (3,9), which are part of my body. (5,9) is empty. So moving up is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: (5,7). Looking at the board, row 7 has enemy snake parts at (7,7) and (7,6). (5,7) is empty. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: (4,8). That's part of my body (the next segment). Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\n- **RIGHT**: (6,8). Check the board. The cell (6,8) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Now, where are the apples? The remaining apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (8,6). The closest ones are (7,4) and (8,6). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,8), that's moving towards the right edge. From there, maybe head down towards (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) could start a path towards lower rows. Moving UP to (5,9) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there, but there isn't.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving down to (5,7) then right towards (6,7), etc., could get closer. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down might be a path. \n\nBut need to avoid the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6). Their body is at (7,7) and (7,6), so moving towards column 7 might be risky. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but (6,7) is empty. Then continue down towards the apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc., towards (8,6). \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the tail is at (2,9). So when moving, the tail will follow. The next move's tail will be at (3,9) if I move, so the body segments will shift. So the new body after moving would be [new head, (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9)]. The tail is at (3,9) now. So avoiding that area.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the safest path. Moving right to (6,8) seems safe. Then from there, maybe down to (6,7), which is empty. Then further down towards the apple at (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving down now to (5,7) and then right towards (6,7), which is also safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,9) might not be useful as there's no apple there, but it's a safe move. However, it's moving away from the remaining apples. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,8) with body parts [(7,7), (7,6)]. So if I move towards column 7, I need to be cautious. But (7,8) is their head. If I move towards (6,8), then (7,8) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (7,8), so moving to (6,8) is adjacent but not directly into them. They might move towards me, but I can't predict their moves. \n\nSo safest options are RIGHT to (6,8) or DOWN to (5,7). Let's evaluate which path leads closer to apples. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. From (5,8), moving down would get closer. If I go down to (5,7), then further down to (5,6), etc., towards row 4. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down through columns 6-7. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving right to (6,8), then right again to (7,8) would be dangerous because the enemy's head is there. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), (7,7) is enemy's body part. So (7,7) is occupied. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm. So moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7) is possible, but (7,7) is enemy's body. So maybe not the best path. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), etc., towards (7,4). That path avoids the enemy snake. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then left to (4,7), but that's moving away from apples. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,8) is better, as it opens a path towards the right side where apples are. But need to check if (6,8) is safe. The board shows that row 8 has my snake's head at (5,8) and the enemy's head at (7,8). So (6,8) is empty. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,8) seems safe and positions me closer to the apples in columns 7 and 8. Next move from (6,8) could be DOWN to (6,7), then towards (7,4) or (8,6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving towards the right might be riskier if the enemy is moving towards me. But since I can't predict their moves, I have to choose the safest path. \n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's check for immediate dangers. \n\nRIGHT to (6,8): safe. \n\nDOWN to (5,7): safe. \n\nWhich direction leads to more apples? The apple at (7,4) is in row 4, column 7. From (5,8), moving down would get me closer. But moving right first might allow a diagonal approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent to that. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4). That path is possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now to (6,8) seems like a step towards that path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut perhaps RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's blocked. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, from (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's a dead end. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7) is better. Then from (5,7), moving right to (6,7), but (7,7) is enemy's body. So (6,7) is safe, but then next move could be down to (6,6), etc. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right towards (6,6), (7,6) is enemy's body. So again, blocked. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (7,4). To get there, moving down and right would be needed. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,3) is on the left side, but that's far from my current position. \n\nSo perhaps the best move is RIGHT to (6,8), then proceed down towards row 4. \n\nBut I need to ensure that moving RIGHT doesn't box me in. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) to start descending. \n\nGiven that both RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but RIGHT might lead towards more apples, I'll choose RIGHT. \n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (6,8), the next move would have to avoid (5,8) which is part of my body. So from (6,8), possible moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT would go back to (5,8), which is now part of my body. So that's a collision. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now would require that next move I can't go left. But that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now allows more flexibility. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN is safer to start moving towards the lower rows where apples are. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (7,8), moving RIGHT to (6,8) is adjacent to their head. If they move left to (6,8), we could collide. But since I can't predict their move, it's a risk. \n\nBut the enemy's body is at (7,7) and (7,6). Their head is at (7,8). So if they move left to (6,8), that's possible. But if I move there now, and they also move there, we both die. \n\nThat's a risk. So maybe moving DOWN is safer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) avoids that risk. \n\nSo perhaps DOWN is better. \n\nBut then, from (5,7), I can move right to (6,7), which is safe. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then down to (5,6), etc. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. So moving down from (5,8) to (5,7), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), then right to (7,4). That's a possible path. \n\nBut that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc. \n\nBut again, the enemy's presence complicates things. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. \n\nGiven that moving RIGHT could risk collision with the enemy if they move left, but moving DOWN is safer and starts a path downward, I think DOWN might be the better choice here. \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN to (5,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Also four moves. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be more direct. However, the enemy's position is at (8,7). If they move LEFT to (7,7), they could block my path. But since their body is at (8,8) and (7,8), they might be moving to avoid their own tail.\n\nAlso, need to check if moving RIGHT to (6,6) is safe. The cell (6,6) is empty. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (7,6), which is adjacent to the enemy's head at (8,7). That might be risky. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) keeps me further from the enemy.\n\nAnother apple is at (7,2), which is further down. But (7,4) is closer. Maybe prioritize (7,4).\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is two steps right from (6,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so moving towards (8,6) might lead to a head-on collision if the enemy moves down to (8,6). \n\nHmm. Maybe safer to go for (7,4). So from (5,6), moving RIGHT to (6,6) is a step towards (7,4). Then next move could be RIGHT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). But need to check if (7,6) is safe. The enemy's body is at (7,8), so (7,6) is two cells down from there. Maybe safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) and then RIGHT. Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (6,6)\nOption 2: DOWN to (5,5)\nOption 3: LEFT to (4,6) \u2013 not useful as it moves away.\n\nOption 1 seems better for reaching apples. But need to check for any immediate dangers. The enemy's head is at (8,7). If they move LEFT to (7,7), that's adjacent to (7,6), which I might reach in two moves. But that's a possible risk. However, since we can't predict their move, maybe proceed with caution.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) avoids any immediate conflict and starts a path towards (7,4). From (5,5), next move could be RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). That path is safe and avoids the enemy's area.\n\nConsidering safety, moving DOWN to (5,5) might be better. Then, proceed right. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now could be more efficient but riskier. Since the enemy is nearby, maybe prioritize safety.\n\nAnother point: the snake's tail is at (3,8). When moving, the tail will shift, so the body segments will be [(5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8)]. No self-collision in any case.\n\nSo, the safest move is DOWN to (5,5), then plan to move right towards the apple. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,6) is more direct but closer to the enemy. Given the uncertainty, perhaps safer to go DOWN first.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (1,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (8,6) with body parts [(8,7), (8,8), (7,8)]. \n\nFirst, check possible moves from the current head position (5,5). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). That's the first body segment. Collision with myself. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,4). Check the board. (5,4) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,5). Check the board. (4,5) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,5). The cell (6,5) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nNow, considering the goal to reach apples and avoid danger. The closest apples are (7,4) and (8,6). Let's see:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,5)**: Moving towards (7,4). From (6,5), next move could be RIGHT to (7,5) then DOWN to (7,4). This path is direct.\n- **DOWN (5,4)**: Moving away from the apples but might allow circling towards (7,4) via (5,4) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (7,4). However, that's two steps right and one up.\n- **LEFT (4,5)**: Moves away from the apples, not ideal.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (8,6). Their body is at (8,7), (8,8), (7,8). They might be heading towards the apple at (8,6) or other areas. If I move towards (7,4), the enemy's current position is not directly in the path. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,4) is two steps right and one down from (5,5). Moving RIGHT to (6,5) gets closer. From there, moving RIGHT again to (7,5) and then DOWN to (7,4). This path seems feasible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might allow a safer path but adds steps. However, if there's a risk near (7,5), maybe safer to go DOWN first. But the enemy is at (8,6), which is two cells to the right of (6,5). They might move towards (8,6) apple, but their next move could be DOWN to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,6). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,5), the next move to (7,5) would be adjacent to the enemy's possible move to (7,6). But since the enemy's body is at (7,8), they might not move left immediately. \n\nConsidering all, moving RIGHT towards (7,4) is the most direct path to an apple. LEFT and DOWN don't contribute to that goal. Therefore, the best move is RIGHT to (6,5) to approach the apple at (7,4).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (3,4) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,6), (6,1), (2,5), (8,4), (9,6). The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4). Next move, if I go up again, I can't go back down because that's where my body is. But maybe there's another apple. Wait, (2,6) is already an apple, so moving there would take it.

No apple there. Then I'd have to move towards other apples. But that's moving away from the current apple at (2,6).\n\nDOWN to (2,4). But that's where my body is.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (2, 6) with the body segments at [(2, 5), (2, 4)]. The apples are located at (6, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (2, 9), and (5, 8). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Now I need to decide the next direction.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nUP: Moving to (2,8). That's towards the apple at (2,9). If I go UP again next turn, I can reach the apple. But I need to check if there's any obstacle. The board shows that at (2,9) there's an apple, so that's safe. The path from (2,7) to (2,8) to (2,9) seems clear. No snakes or walls in that path. After eating the apple, my body will grow, so I need to make sure I don't trap myself. But for now, moving UP seems good.\n\nDOWN: That would take me to (2,6), which is part of my body. That's a collision, so DOWN is not an option.\n\nLEFT: Moving to (1,7). There's no apple there. It's a safe move, but not helpful for points. Maybe to avoid the enemy, but the enemy is at (9,4), which is far away. Not sure if necessary.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (3,7). No apple here. Could head towards the apple at (5,8) or (7,2). But (5,8) is up and right. From (3,7), moving UP to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), etc. But that's a longer path. The apple at (7,2) is down and right.

But next turn, after moving to (2,8), the next move would be UP to (2,9) to get the apple, then I can decide to go left or right from there.

The enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at [(9,5), (9,4)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current head is at (2,9). Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The board is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (3,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3,9) would take me to (3,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (3,8). Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So prioritizing (5,8) is better.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), which is not near my current path. So no immediate threat from them.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (4,8), setting up to collect the apple at (5,8) next turn. This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently targets the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples available are at (6,1), (7,2), (5,8), (2,3), and (7,4). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7,7) with body parts [(7,6), (8,6)]. The board shows that the apple at (5,8) is in row 8, which is the same row as my current head position.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,8). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,9). Looking at the board state, row 9 has a T (which I think represents a tail or part of a snake) at (2,9) and (3,9). Wait, my snake's body includes (3,9) and (2,9), so (4,9) is empty. But wait, the board's row 9 shows \". . T T . . . . . .\", so columns 2 and 3 are T's. So (4,9) is empty. But moving UP would take me to (4,9), which is safe. However, after moving, my body would be [(4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. So no collision here.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,7). Check the board: row 7 has the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6), but (4,7) is empty. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,8). That's part of my body (the first segment after the head). Collision with myself. Invalid.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,8). The apple is at (5,8). So moving RIGHT would collect the apple, grow by one segment, and gain a point. This seems like the best option.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (5,8). If I move RIGHT to (5,8), I eat the apple. That's good. But I need to check if that's a valid move. The board shows that (5,8) is marked as 'A', so it's an apple. Moving there is allowed and beneficial.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (7,7). They are not near (5,8), so no immediate threat. Also, after eating the apple, my snake's length increases, so the next move will have to be careful not to run into the new tail. But for this turn, moving RIGHT to get the apple is the priority.\n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (4,9), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to any apples. The next closest apple after (5,8) is (7,4) or (2,3), which are further away. So moving RIGHT to eat the apple now is optimal.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (5,8), the next move would need to avoid the new tail. But since the growth happens after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately. So after moving to (5,8), the body becomes [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. The next move would need to avoid (4,8) if possible, but that's a future consideration.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (5,8) to collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. This avoids self-collision and walls, and directly targets the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The next move needs to avoid colliding with myself or the enemy snake.\n\nPossible directions from (5,8):\n\n- **UP**: (5,9). Check the board. Row 9 has T's at (2,9) and (3,9), which are part of my body. (5,9) is empty. So moving up is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: (5,7). Looking at the board, row 7 has enemy snake parts at (7,7) and (7,6). (5,7) is empty. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: (4,8). That's part of my body (the next segment). Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\n- **RIGHT**: (6,8). Check the board. The cell (6,8) is empty. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Now, where are the apples? The remaining apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (8,6). The closest ones are (7,4) and (8,6). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,8), that's moving towards the right edge. From there, maybe head down towards (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) could start a path towards lower rows. Moving UP to (5,9) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there, but there isn't.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving down to (5,7) then right towards (6,7), etc., could get closer. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down might be a path. \n\nBut need to avoid the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6). Their body is at (7,7) and (7,6), so moving towards column 7 might be risky. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but (6,7) is empty. Then continue down towards the apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc., towards (8,6). \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the tail is at (2,9). So when moving, the tail will follow. The next move's tail will be at (3,9) if I move, so the body segments will shift. So the new body after moving would be [new head, (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9)]. The tail is at (3,9) now. So avoiding that area.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the safest path. Moving right to (6,8) seems safe. Then from there, maybe down to (6,7), which is empty. Then further down towards the apple at (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving down now to (5,7) and then right towards (6,7), which is also safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,9) might not be useful as there's no apple there, but it's a safe move. However, it's moving away from the remaining apples. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,8) with body parts [(7,7), (7,6)]. So if I move towards column 7, I need to be cautious. But (7,8) is their head. If I move towards (6,8), then (7,8) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (7,8), so moving to (6,8) is adjacent but not directly into them. They might move towards me, but I can't predict their moves. \n\nSo safest options are RIGHT to (6,8) or DOWN to (5,7). Let's evaluate which path leads closer to apples. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. From (5,8), moving down would get closer. If I go down to (5,7), then further down to (5,6), etc., towards row 4. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down through columns 6-7. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving right to (6,8), then right again to (7,8) would be dangerous because the enemy's head is there. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), (7,7) is enemy's body part. So (7,7) is occupied. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm. So moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7) is possible, but (7,7) is enemy's body. So maybe not the best path. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), etc., towards (7,4). That path avoids the enemy snake. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then left to (4,7), but that's moving away from apples. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,8) is better, as it opens a path towards the right side where apples are. But need to check if (6,8) is safe. The board shows that row 8 has my snake's head at (5,8) and the enemy's head at (7,8). So (6,8) is empty. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,8) seems safe and positions me closer to the apples in columns 7 and 8. Next move from (6,8) could be DOWN to (6,7), then towards (7,4) or (8,6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving towards the right might be riskier if the enemy is moving towards me. But since I can't predict their moves, I have to choose the safest path. \n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's check for immediate dangers. \n\nRIGHT to (6,8): safe. \n\nDOWN to (5,7): safe. \n\nWhich direction leads to more apples? The apple at (7,4) is in row 4, column 7. From (5,8), moving down would get me closer. But moving right first might allow a diagonal approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent to that. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4). That path is possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now to (6,8) seems like a step towards that path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut perhaps RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's blocked. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, from (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's a dead end. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7) is better. Then from (5,7), moving right to (6,7), but (7,7) is enemy's body. So (6,7) is safe, but then next move could be down to (6,6), etc. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right towards (6,6), (7,6) is enemy's body. So again, blocked. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (7,4). To get there, moving down and right would be needed. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,3) is on the left side, but that's far from my current position. \n\nSo perhaps the best move is RIGHT to (6,8), then proceed down towards row 4. \n\nBut I need to ensure that moving RIGHT doesn't box me in. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) to start descending. \n\nGiven that both RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but RIGHT might lead towards more apples, I'll choose RIGHT. \n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (6,8), the next move would have to avoid (5,8) which is part of my body. So from (6,8), possible moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT would go back to (5,8), which is now part of my body. So that's a collision. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now would require that next move I can't go left. But that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now allows more flexibility. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN is safer to start moving towards the lower rows where apples are. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (7,8), moving RIGHT to (6,8) is adjacent to their head. If they move left to (6,8), we could collide. But since I can't predict their move, it's a risk. \n\nBut the enemy's body is at (7,7) and (7,6). Their head is at (7,8). So if they move left to (6,8), that's possible. But if I move there now, and they also move there, we both die. \n\nThat's a risk. So maybe moving DOWN is safer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) avoids that risk. \n\nSo perhaps DOWN is better. \n\nBut then, from (5,7), I can move right to (6,7), which is safe. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then down to (5,6), etc. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. So moving down from (5,8) to (5,7), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), then right to (7,4). That's a possible path. \n\nBut that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc. \n\nBut again, the enemy's presence complicates things. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. \n\nGiven that moving RIGHT could risk collision with the enemy if they move left, but moving DOWN is safer and starts a path downward, I think DOWN might be the better choice here. \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN to (5,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Moving RIGHT to (6,6) is still a few steps away from the enemy. The enemy's head is at (8,7), so they might move towards the apple at (8,6). If I move towards (8,6), there's a potential collision risk if the enemy also goes there. But maybe I can reach it first.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) could be safer, but it's moving away from the apples. However, (7,4) is in the lower right. From (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then (7,5), then down to (7,4). That path might work.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,4) is closer in terms of steps.

Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (6,6)\nOption 2: DOWN to (5,5)\nOption 3: LEFT to (4,6) \u2013 not useful as it moves away.\n\nOption 1 seems better for reaching apples. But need to check for any immediate dangers. The enemy's head is at (8,7). If they move LEFT to (7,7), that's adjacent to (7,6), which I might reach in two moves. But that's a possible risk. However, since we can't predict their move, maybe proceed with caution.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) avoids any immediate conflict and starts a path towards (7,4). From (5,5), next move could be RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). That path is safe and avoids the enemy's area.\n\nConsidering safety, moving DOWN to (5,5) might be better. Then, proceed right. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now could be more efficient but riskier. Since the enemy is nearby, maybe prioritize safety.\n\nAnother point: the snake's tail is at (3,8). When moving, the tail will shift, so the body segments will be [(5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8)]. No self-collision in any case.\n\nSo, the safest move is DOWN to (5,5), then plan to move right towards the apple. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,6) is more direct but closer to the enemy. Given the uncertainty, perhaps safer to go DOWN first.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (1,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (8,6) with body parts [(8,7), (8,8), (7,8)]. \n\nFirst, check possible moves from the current head position (5,5). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). That's the first body segment. Collision with myself. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,4). Check the board. (5,4) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,5). Check the board. (4,5) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,5). The cell (6,5) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nNow, considering the goal to reach apples and avoid danger. The closest apples are (7,4) and (8,6). Let's see:\n\n- **RIGHT (6,5)**: Moving towards (7,4). From (6,5), next move could be RIGHT to (7,5) then DOWN to (7,4). This path is direct.\n- **DOWN (5,4)**: Moving away from the apples but might allow circling towards (7,4) via (5,4) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (7,4). However, that's two steps right and one up.\n- **LEFT (4,5)**: Moves away from the apples, not ideal.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (8,6). Their body is at (8,7), (8,8), (7,8). They might be heading towards the apple at (8,6) or other areas. If I move towards (7,4), the enemy's current position is not directly in the path. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,4) is two steps right and one down from (5,5). Moving RIGHT to (6,5) gets closer. From there, moving RIGHT again to (7,5) and then DOWN to (7,4). This path seems feasible. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might allow a safer path but adds steps. However, if there's a risk near (7,5), maybe safer to go DOWN first. But the enemy is at (8,6), which is two cells to the right of (6,5). They might move towards (8,6) apple, but their next move could be DOWN to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,6). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,5), the next move to (7,5) would be adjacent to the enemy's possible move to (7,6). But since the enemy's body is at (7,8), they might not move left immediately. \n\nConsidering all, moving RIGHT towards (7,4) is the most direct path to an apple. LEFT and DOWN don't contribute to that goal. Therefore, the best move is RIGHT to (6,5) to approach the apple at (7,4).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Wait, the current position after moving right would be (6,5), and the body segments follow. So the body is now [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)] because each segment moves forward. Wait, the initial body after moving right would be the previous head's position becomes the first body part. So the snake's body after moving right to (6,5) would be [(6,5) as the head, then the previous body parts shift. Wait, the original body was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]. When the head moves right to (6,5), the new body becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)] and the tail (5,8) is removed unless an apple was eaten. But in the last move, the direction was RIGHT, and the head moved to (6,5). Since there's no apple at (6,5), the snake's body would now be [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)] but wait, no\u2014the snake's length remains the same unless it eats an apple. So the snake's body is the head followed by the previous body parts minus the last one. Wait, the snake's body length is 4 segments plus the head. Wait, the initial body was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)] with the head at (6,5). So after moving right, the new body is [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)], and the tail (5,8) is removed. So the current body is [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Wait, but the user's current snake position is given as [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)] with the head at (6,5). Wait, maybe the body is the previous positions. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe user says: \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]\". So the head is at (6,5), and the body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]. So the snake's body is the head followed by the four body parts. So the snake's length is 5 (head + 4 body parts). So when moving, the next move will add a new head and shift the body, removing the last segment if no apple is eaten.\n\nNow, the current head is at (6,5). Possible moves: UP (6,6), DOWN (6,4), LEFT (5,5), RIGHT (7,5).\n\nCheck each direction for safety and apples:\n\nUP: (6,6). Is that a safe spot? Looking at the board state provided. The board shows rows from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom). Let's parse the board:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) is \". . . . . T 2 . . .\". So (6,5) is the head (2). The body parts are at (5,5) which is T (tail?), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Wait, the board shows at row 5 (y=5), column 6 is '2', which is the head. The body parts are at (5,5) which is 'T' (maybe tail?), (5,6) is 'T', (5,7) is 'T', (5,8) is 'T'. So moving UP to (6,6) would be row y=6. Looking at row 6 (y=6) in the board: \". . . . . T . 1 T .\". So (6,6) is column 6, row 6. The row 6 (y=6) has at column 5: T, column 7: 1 (enemy snake), column 8: T. So (6,6) is empty. So moving UP to (6,6) is safe.\n\nDOWN: (6,4). Check row 4 (y=4). The board shows \". . . . . . . A . .\". So (6,4) is column 6, row 4. There's an apple at (7,4) (column 7, row 4). So (6,4) is empty. Safe.\n\nLEFT: (5,5). The current body's first segment is (5,5), which is a 'T' on the board. So moving left would go into the snake's own body. That's a collision. So LEFT is not safe.\n\nRIGHT: (7,5). Check row 5 (y=5). The board shows at column 7: '.', so (7,5) is empty. But need to check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (7,6) with body parts [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. So (7,5) is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (1,0). The closest ones are (7,4) which is two steps down from (6,5) (current head). Also, (7,2) is three steps down and left. (6,1) is four steps down. (2,3) is left and up. (1,0) is far.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5), then next move could be DOWN to (7,4) to get the apple. That's a direct path. So moving RIGHT now would get closer to (7,4).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,4) would be one step closer to (7,4) as well. From (6,4), moving RIGHT to (7,4) would get the apple. So either RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT. Which is shorter? Both are two steps. But moving RIGHT first might be better because if someone else is going for (7,4), but the enemy snake is at (7,6). Their next move could be towards (7,5) or (7,7), but not sure.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (7,6) with body [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. Their head is at (7,6). Possible moves for them: UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6). If they move DOWN to (7,5), then moving RIGHT to (7,5) would collide with them. So there's a risk if the enemy moves down into (7,5) the same time I move there. But since we can't predict their move, maybe it's safer to take a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,4) avoids that risk. From (6,4), moving RIGHT to (7,4) would get the apple. That path is safe as long as (7,4) is still there. But apples are static until eaten, right? So if I can reach (7,4) in two steps, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,6) might lead towards other apples, but the closest is (7,4). UP seems to take me away from the apples.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's evaluate:\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5):\n\n- Next turn, if enemy snake moves to (7,5), I die. But if they move elsewhere, I can proceed to (7,4).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,4):\n\n- Next turn, move RIGHT to (7,4) and eat the apple. Safer path, as the enemy is at (7,6) and may not be moving towards (7,4).\n\nBut the enemy's head is at (7,6). If they move DOWN to (7,5), then (7,5) is dangerous. But if I move RIGHT now, I'm at (7,5), which could be a collision if the enemy moves there. Alternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,4), then next move to (7,4) is safe.\n\nHmm. Risk assessment: moving RIGHT to (7,5) has a potential collision risk if the enemy moves down. Moving DOWN to (6,4) avoids that risk and sets up a direct path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (7,5). Let's check their possible moves. Their head is at (7,6). Their body is [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. So their possible moves from (7,6):\n\n- UP: (7,7) \u2013 empty?\nLooking at the board, row 7 (y=7) has at column 8: T. So (7,7) is empty. Safe for them.\n- DOWN: (7,5) \u2013 empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,6) \u2013 empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,6) \u2013 which is part of their body (their body is [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]). So moving RIGHT into their own body. Not allowed.\n\nSo enemy snake #1 can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If they move DOWN to (7,5), then if I move RIGHT to (7,5), we collide and both die. But if I move RIGHT and they move DOWN, that's a problem. Alternatively, if they move LEFT to (6,6), then they are moving away.\n\nBut since we can't predict their move, it's a risk. So perhaps moving DOWN to (6,4) is safer, avoiding that potential collision.\n\nAdditionally, moving DOWN to (6,4) and then RIGHT to (7,4) gets the apple. That's a two-step plan with less risk.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,5) and then DOWN to (7,4) also gets the apple. But with the risk of collision.\n\nWhich is better? It depends on the likelihood of the enemy moving to (7,5). Since the enemy's head is at (7,6), moving DOWN to (7,5) is a possible move. If they do that, and I move RIGHT into (7,5), we both die. But if they move elsewhere, I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,4), then even if the enemy moves to (7,5), I'm safe. Then next turn, I can move RIGHT to (7,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo perhaps the safer path is DOWN now, then RIGHT.\n\nBut what's the priority? To get the apple. If I can reach it in two steps either way, but with different risks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going to move DOWN. Maybe they are going for their own apple. The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (1,0). The enemy's position is (7,6). The closest apple to them is (7,4) which is two steps down. So they might move DOWN twice to get it. If they move DOWN to (7,5) this turn, then next turn to (7,4). If I move RIGHT to (7,5) this turn, and they also move there, collision. But if I move DOWN to (6,4), then next turn I can get to (7,4) before them if they take two steps.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves DOWN to (7,5) this turn, then next turn they can move DOWN to (7,4). If I move RIGHT to (7,5) this turn, I die. If I move DOWN to (6,4), then next turn I can move to (7,4) and eat the apple before they do (if they are at (7,5) and move down to (7,4) the same time I do, we both collide there. But that's a risk either way.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the safest path is to go DOWN to (6,4) now, then RIGHT to (7,4) next turn. That way, even if the enemy is moving towards (7,4), I might reach it first. Alternatively, if the enemy is moving towards (7,4), they might take two steps from (7,6) to (7,5) then (7,4). If I take two steps from (6,5) to (6,4) then (7,4), I reach it on the second step. So timing-wise, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I go RIGHT to (7,5) now, and the enemy moves DOWN to (7,5), I die. If they don't, then next turn I can go DOWN to (7,4) and eat the apple.\n\nBut since we can't predict their move, perhaps the safer choice is to avoid potential collision this turn. So moving DOWN to (6,4) is safer. Then next turn, move RIGHT to (7,4) to get the apple.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,4) is in row 4, column 7. From (6,4), moving RIGHT to (7,4) is direct. So that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,5) and then DOWN to (7,4) also works. But the risk is higher this turn.\n\nGiven that the enemy's possible moves include DOWN to (7,5), which would be dangerous if I move RIGHT, I think the safer move is DOWN to (6,4) to avoid that risk. Then proceed towards the apple next turn.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo between UP, DOWN, RIGHT. UP takes me to (6,6), which is empty but away from apples. DOWN to (6,4) is closer to (7,4). RIGHT to (7,5) is closer but riskier.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (6,4) to approach the apple at (7,4) safely.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body either. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples seem to be (2,5) and (2,6). From my current position (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would get me closer to those. Then, from there, moving up to (2,5) would get an apple. Alternatively, maybe moving up first? Let me check possible moves.\n\nIf I move UP from (3,4) to (3,5). Then, from there, I can go left to (2,5) which is an apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Either way, two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is one step left and one up from (3,4). So if I go LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) gets the apple. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). Both are two steps. But maybe the first step is better to go LEFT to get closer to multiple apples. Because (2,6) is also up from (2,5). So after getting (2,5), next could go to (2,6). That's a path for two apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is to the right. From (3,4), moving right would take me to (4,4), (5,4), etc. But that's a longer path. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far from (8,4), but maybe not a threat yet.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is down and right. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then right... but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,6) is even further. So the closest apples are (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the best initial move would be to go LEFT towards (2,4), then UP to (2,5) for the apple. That way, I can start growing and then maybe go for (2,6) next. Also, moving left first avoids any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (8,1), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nWait, but what's the current position of the enemy? Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body. So they might be moving towards the apples as well. But since they're on the other side of the board, maybe not a problem right now.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving, I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (3,4) is safe because x=2 is within 0-9. Moving up to (3,5) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut if I go LEFT first, then I can get to (2,4), which is adjacent to (2,5) apple. Then next move, UP to get the apple. That seems efficient. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) also gets the apple. Both are two moves. But maybe going LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to both (2,5) and (2,6) apples.\n\nWait, but after getting (2,5), the next apple at (2,6) is up from there. So after eating (2,5), moving up again would get (2,6). So that's a good path. So starting with LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6) (another apple). That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Also works. So which first step is better?\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is at (3,4). The apple at (2,5) is one left and one up. So moving LEFT first would get me to (2,4), then UP to (2,5). But moving UP first to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) is the same number of steps. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because if the enemy is moving towards the same apples, but they are far away. Also, moving LEFT first might allow me to collect the apple in the next move, and then proceed to (2,6).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the apple at (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. That's on the same row as my current position (y=4). If I go right, I could head towards that, but it's 5 steps away. But maybe after collecting the closer apples, I can go there. But for now, the closest apples are the ones at (2,5) and (2,6).\n\nSo the first move should be either LEFT or UP. Let's check possible collisions. Since there's no body parts, and the enemy is at (8,1), moving LEFT to (2,4) is safe. No snakes there. Similarly, moving UP to (3,5) is safe. So both options are safe.\n\nBut which direction gives more flexibility? If I go LEFT to (2,4), then next move I can go UP to (2,5) for the apple. Then, after that, UP to (2,6) for another apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first allows me to have more options. Let's see. If I go UP to (3,5), then next move I can go LEFT to (2,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6), etc. But if I go LEFT first to (2,4), then next move options are UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). So perhaps moving UP first gives more options, but moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple.\n\nHmm. Since the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the closest ones is better. So the first move should be LEFT to (2,4), then UP to (2,5) to get the apple. That's the plan. So the direction should be LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the coordinates again. The current position is (3,4). Moving LEFT would decrease x by 1, so (2,4). Then UP to (2,5) which is an apple. Yes. Then after that, UP to (2,6) which is another apple. So that's two apples in three moves. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5) (apple), then UP to (2,6). Same result. So which first move is better? Maybe LEFT first because it's a direct path towards the apple. Also, if there's any competition for the apple, getting there faster is better. But since the enemy is at (8,1), they are far away. So maybe either direction is okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions me closer to the apple. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next move UP to get the apple. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

There's an apple there. If I go up, I'll eat the apple, grow to three segments, and gain a point. That's good. But after that, my body would be at (2,5) and (2,4).

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 4) with a body segment at (8, 3).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from my current head position (2, 6). The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (to (2, 7))**: This is a valid move. There's no apple here, but moving up would take me towards the apple at (2, 9). However, the path from (2,7) to (2,9) is clear, but I need to ensure there are no obstacles. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat. The risk here is moving into a potential dead end if I can't reach the apple quickly.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 5))**: This is where my body segment is located. Moving here would result in a collision with myself, leading to death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 6))**: Moving left is possible. There's no apple here, but it might be a safer path to avoid the enemy or position for future apples. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (6,1), which is quite far. This move doesn't immediately gain points but avoids potential risks.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 6))**: This is a valid move. No apple here, but moving right could lead towards the apple at (5,8) if I navigate upwards. However, the path might require careful planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\nConsidering the apples, the closest ones are (2,9) upwards and (5,8) to the right. The apple at (2,9) is two steps up from (2,7), but moving UP now doesn't get me an apple immediately. The apple at (5,8) is further right and up. \n\nHowever, there's an apple at (9,6) which is far to the right. Moving RIGHT multiple times could eventually reach it, but that's a longer path with potential risks from the enemy snake at (8,4). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (2,9) seems promising. After moving UP to (2,7), the next move would be UP again to (2,8), then UP to (2,9) to get the apple. This path is clear of obstacles based on the current board state. \n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. They are at (8,4), which is far from my current path. Their movement might not interfere with mine immediately. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding getting boxed in. Moving UP keeps me along the left edge, which could limit future movement options. However, since the apple at (2,9) is at the top edge, grabbing it would allow me to turn left or right afterward. \n\nGiven the options, moving UP towards the apple at (2,9) seems strategic. It's a direct path with minimal immediate risks. The next moves would need to ensure I don't trap myself after growing, but for now, securing the apple is beneficial.\n</think>\n\nUP"

Moving UP would take me to (2,10), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid. Oh, right, the board is 0-9 in both x and y. So moving UP from (2,9) would go off the board, causing a death. So UP is not an option. That's a mistake in the previous move's rationale. Wait, the last move was UP, which took the snake from (2,8) to (2,9), which was valid because (2,9) is within the grid. Now, the current position is (2,9), so moving UP again would be (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So that's a no-go.\n\nSo possible moves now are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) to (2,8). But (2,8) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So moving DOWN would hit the body. That's suicide. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is that occupied? Looking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) is: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (2,9) is the head. (1,9) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe. But there's no apple there. However, moving LEFT could be a way to start maneuvering towards another apple.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). The board shows row 9 as: . . 2 . . . . . . . So (3,9) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. Again, no apple there. But perhaps this direction allows more options next turn.\n\nApples nearby: The closest apples are (5,8) which is at y=8, x=5. From (2,9), moving LEFT or RIGHT could start heading towards that. Alternatively, the apple at (2,3) is further down, but that's a long way. The apple at (5,8) is in row 8, column 5. So from (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) then down to (1,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then down to (3,8), then right towards (5,8). \n\nBut the immediate priority is to avoid death. Since UP is a wall, DOWN is body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible. \n\nWait, the snake's body after moving UP last time is now [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] with the head at (2,9). So the next move can't go back into the body. So moving LEFT or RIGHT are the only options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I could go DOWN to (1,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards the apple at (5,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8), which is empty (since the board at row 8 has a T at (2,8) which is part of my body, but (3,8) is empty). \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 8: . . T . . A . . . . So (2,8) is T (my body), (5,8) is A (apple). So if I can get to (5,8), that's an apple. From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8), then to (5,8). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (1,9), moving DOWN to (1,8), then RIGHT through (2,8) (which is my body, so can't), so that path is blocked. So maybe moving RIGHT is better.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT again towards (5,8). That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), but from there, moving RIGHT would hit (2,8) which is my body. So that's a dead end. So maybe moving LEFT isn't the best path.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, moving RIGHT seems better as it allows a path towards the apple at (5,8). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (9,6) with body parts at (9,5) and (9,4). They are on the far right side, so probably not an immediate threat. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9), then plan to go DOWN next to approach the apple at (5,8). That path is safe and leads towards an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,9) but that might not lead anywhere useful quickly. \n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and RIGHT. Since RIGHT leads towards the apple at (5,8), which is closer than others (except maybe (7,2) but that's further away in x direction), RIGHT is better.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (5,8), (2,3), and (7,4). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,6) with body parts at [(9,6), (9,5)]. The board is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (3,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3,9) would take me to (3,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (3,8). Checking the board state, row 8 has a T (my body) at (2,8), but (3,8) is empty. So (3,8) is safe. No immediate collision here.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (2,9). But (2,9) is part of my body (the first segment). That would cause a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,9). The board shows row 9 as having my head at (3,9) and the rest empty up to (9,9). So (4,9) is empty. Safe move.\n\nSo valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (5,8). From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (5,8) would reach the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,9) and then DOWN might take longer. Let's map the paths:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next move could be RIGHT to (4,8), then RIGHT again to (5,8) to eat the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple. But need to check if (4,8) is safe. The board shows row 8 as having an apple at (5,8) and my body at (2,8). (4,8) is empty. So that path is viable.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Also two moves. But (4,9) is on the edge, so moving DOWN from there might limit future options.\n\nComparing the two, moving DOWN first seems more direct towards the apple. However, moving RIGHT to (4,9) might open up more space for maneuvering, avoiding getting boxed in. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,6), which is far from my current position, so immediate threats are low.\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (4,9) leaves the body at (3,9), (2,9), etc. If I go RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (4,8), then proceed towards the apple. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, the next move is RIGHT towards the apple. Both paths are valid, but moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple faster.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,8) is in row 8. If I move DOWN to (3,8), I'm in row 8, x=3. Then moving RIGHT twice would reach x=5. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), that's also two moves. So same number of steps. However, moving DOWN first might be safer because it's closer to the apple and reduces the risk of getting blocked by the enemy or my own body.\n\nAdditionally, moving RIGHT to (4,9) would leave my head at the edge of the board. If I need to turn around later, that might be risky. Whereas moving DOWN to (3,8) keeps me more central, allowing more flexibility.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (2,3), but that's much further down. The apple at (7,4) is also a possible target after (5,8). So prioritizing the closest apple makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (3,8), setting up a path towards the apple at (5,8). This avoids self-collision and walls, and efficiently approaches the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Wait, my snake's body includes (3,9) and (2,9), so (4,9) is empty. But wait, the board's row 9 shows \". . T T . . . . . .\", so columns 2 and 3 are T's. So (4,9) is empty.

Row 9 has T's at (2,9) and (3,9), which are part of my body. (5,9) is empty. So moving up is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: (5,7). Looking at the board, row 7 has enemy snake parts at (7,7) and (7,6).

Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) could start a path towards lower rows. Moving UP to (5,9) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there, but there isn't.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving down to (5,7) then right towards (6,7), etc., could get closer. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down might be a path. \n\nBut need to avoid the enemy snake at (7,7) and (7,6). Their body is at (7,7) and (7,6), so moving towards column 7 might be risky. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but (6,7) is empty. Then continue down towards the apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc., towards (8,6). \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the tail is at (2,9). So when moving, the tail will follow. The next move's tail will be at (3,9) if I move, so the body segments will shift. So the new body after moving would be [new head, (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9)]. The tail is at (3,9) now. So avoiding that area.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the safest path. Moving right to (6,8) seems safe. Then from there, maybe down to (6,7), which is empty. Then further down towards the apple at (7,4) or (8,6). Alternatively, moving down now to (5,7) and then right towards (6,7), which is also safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,9) might not be useful as there's no apple there, but it's a safe move. However, it's moving away from the remaining apples. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,8) with body parts [(7,7), (7,6)]. So if I move towards column 7, I need to be cautious. But (7,8) is their head. If I move towards (6,8), then (7,8) is adjacent. But the enemy's head is at (7,8), so moving to (6,8) is adjacent but not directly into them. They might move towards me, but I can't predict their moves. \n\nSo safest options are RIGHT to (6,8) or DOWN to (5,7). Let's evaluate which path leads closer to apples. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. From (5,8), moving down would get closer. If I go down to (5,7), then further down to (5,6), etc., towards row 4. Alternatively, moving right to (6,8) and then down through columns 6-7. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (5,8), moving right to (6,8), then right again to (7,8) would be dangerous because the enemy's head is there. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), (7,7) is enemy's body part. So (7,7) is occupied. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm. So moving down to (5,7) and then right to (6,7) is possible, but (7,7) is enemy's body. So maybe not the best path. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), etc., towards (7,4). That path avoids the enemy snake. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then left to (4,7), but that's moving away from apples. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,8) is better, as it opens a path towards the right side where apples are. But need to check if (6,8) is safe. The board shows that row 8 has my snake's head at (5,8) and the enemy's head at (7,8). So (6,8) is empty. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,8) seems safe and positions me closer to the apples in columns 7 and 8. Next move from (6,8) could be DOWN to (6,7), then towards (7,4) or (8,6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving towards the right might be riskier if the enemy is moving towards me. But since I can't predict their moves, I have to choose the safest path. \n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's check for immediate dangers. \n\nRIGHT to (6,8): safe. \n\nDOWN to (5,7): safe. \n\nWhich direction leads to more apples? The apple at (7,4) is in row 4, column 7. From (5,8), moving down would get me closer. But moving right first might allow a diagonal approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then down to (6,6), etc. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent to that. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4). That path is possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now to (6,8) seems like a step towards that path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) and then proceeding down. \n\nBut perhaps RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. From (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's blocked. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, from (6,8), moving down to (6,7), then right to (7,7) is enemy's body. So that's a dead end. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7) is better. Then from (5,7), moving right to (6,7), but (7,7) is enemy's body. So (6,7) is safe, but then next move could be down to (6,6), etc. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving down to (5,6), then right towards (6,6), (7,6) is enemy's body. So again, blocked. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (7,4). To get there, moving down and right would be needed. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,3) is on the left side, but that's far from my current position. \n\nSo perhaps the best move is RIGHT to (6,8), then proceed down towards row 4. \n\nBut I need to ensure that moving RIGHT doesn't box me in. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) to start descending. \n\nGiven that both RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but RIGHT might lead towards more apples, I'll choose RIGHT. \n\nBut wait, after moving RIGHT to (6,8), the next move would have to avoid (5,8) which is part of my body. So from (6,8), possible moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT would go back to (5,8), which is now part of my body. So that's a collision. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now would require that next move I can't go left. But that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now allows more flexibility. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN is safer to start moving towards the lower rows where apples are. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (7,8), moving RIGHT to (6,8) is adjacent to their head. If they move left to (6,8), we could collide. But since I can't predict their move, it's a risk. \n\nBut the enemy's body is at (7,7) and (7,6). Their head is at (7,8). So if they move left to (6,8), that's possible. But if I move there now, and they also move there, we both die. \n\nThat's a risk. So maybe moving DOWN is safer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) avoids that risk. \n\nSo perhaps DOWN is better. \n\nBut then, from (5,7), I can move right to (6,7), which is safe. \n\nBut (7,7) is enemy's body, so (6,7) is adjacent. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,7), then down to (5,6), etc. \n\nThe apple at (7,4) is in row 4. So moving down from (5,8) to (5,7), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), then right to (7,4). That's a possible path. \n\nBut that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,8), then down to (6,7), (6,6), etc. \n\nBut again, the enemy's presence complicates things. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. \n\nGiven that moving RIGHT could risk collision with the enemy if they move left, but moving DOWN is safer and starts a path downward, I think DOWN might be the better choice here. \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN to (5,7).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,8) with body parts [(7,8), (7,7)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,7). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,8). But looking at the snake's body, (5,8) is the next segment. Colliding with myself. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,6). Check the board. The cell (5,6) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,7). Check the board. (4,7) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,7). Check the board. (6,7) is empty.

If the enemy moves towards (6,7), there's a risk. However, since we can't predict their move, need to proceed cautiously.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) avoids immediate threats and starts a path towards (7,4).

The enemy snake #1 is at (8,7) with body parts [(8,8), (7,8)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,6). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,7). But that's the first body segment. Collision with myself. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,5). Check the board. (5,5) is empty.

Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Now, considering the goal to reach apples and avoid danger.\n\nThe closest apples are (7,4) and (8,6). Moving RIGHT towards (6,6) gets me closer to (8,6). From (6,6), next moves could be RIGHT again towards (7,6), then down to (7,5), (7,4). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) might lead towards (7,4) by going right and down. Moving LEFT to (4,6) takes me away from the apples.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,7). Their body is at (8,8) and (7,8). Moving RIGHT to (6,6) is still a few steps away from the enemy. The enemy's head is at (8,7), so they might move towards the apple at (8,6). If I move towards (8,6), there's a potential collision risk if the enemy also goes there. But maybe I can reach it first.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) could be safer, but it's moving away from the apples. However, (7,4) is in the lower right. From (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then (7,5), then down to (7,4). That path might work.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,4) is closer in terms of steps. From (5,6), moving RIGHT to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5), then RIGHT to (6,5), (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). Also four moves. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be more direct. However, the enemy's position is at (8,7). If they move LEFT to (7,7), they could block my path. But since their body is at (8,8) and (7,8), they might be moving to avoid their own tail.\n\nAlso, need to check if moving RIGHT to (6,6) is safe. The cell (6,6) is empty. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (7,6), which is adjacent to the enemy's head at (8,7). That might be risky. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) keeps me further from the enemy.\n\nAnother apple is at (7,2), which is further down. But (7,4) is closer. Maybe prioritize (7,4).\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is two steps right from (6,6). But the enemy is at (8,7), so moving towards (8,6) might lead to a head-on collision if the enemy moves down to (8,6). \n\nHmm. Maybe safer to go for (7,4). So from (5,6), moving RIGHT to (6,6) is a step towards (7,4). Then next move could be RIGHT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). But need to check if (7,6) is safe. The enemy's body is at (7,8), so (7,6) is two cells down from there. Maybe safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) and then RIGHT. Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: RIGHT to (6,6)\nOption 2: DOWN to (5,5)\nOption 3: LEFT to (4,6) \u2013 not useful as it moves away.\n\nOption 1 seems better for reaching apples. But need to check for any immediate dangers. The enemy's head is at (8,7). If they move LEFT to (7,7), that's adjacent to (7,6), which I might reach in two moves. But that's a possible risk. However, since we can't predict their move, maybe proceed with caution.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) avoids any immediate conflict and starts a path towards (7,4). From (5,5), next move could be RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4). That path is safe and avoids the enemy's area.\n\nConsidering safety, moving DOWN to (5,5) might be better. Then, proceed right. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now could be more efficient but riskier. Since the enemy is nearby, maybe prioritize safety.\n\nAnother point: the snake's tail is at (3,8). When moving, the tail will shift, so the body segments will be [(5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8)]. No self-collision in any case.\n\nSo, the safest move is DOWN to (5,5), then plan to move right towards the apple. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,6) is more direct but closer to the enemy. Given the uncertainty, perhaps safer to go DOWN first.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Wait, the current position after moving right would be (6,5), and the body segments follow. So the body is now [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)] because each segment moves forward. Wait, the initial body after moving right would be the previous head's position becomes the first body part. So the snake's body after moving right to (6,5) would be [(6,5) as the head, then the previous body parts shift. Wait, the original body was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]. When the head moves right to (6,5), the new body becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)] and the tail (5,8) is removed unless an apple was eaten. But in the last move, the direction was RIGHT, and the head moved to (6,5). Since there's no apple at (6,5), the snake's body would now be [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)] but wait, no\u2014the snake's length remains the same unless it eats an apple. So the snake's body is the head followed by the previous body parts minus the last one. Wait, the snake's body length is 4 segments plus the head. Wait, the initial body was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)] with the head at (6,5). So after moving right, the new body is [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)], and the tail (5,8) is removed. So the current body is [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Wait, but the user's current snake position is given as [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)] with the head at (6,5). Wait, maybe the body is the previous positions. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe user says: \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]\". So the head is at (6,5), and the body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]. So the snake's body is the head followed by the four body parts. So the snake's length is 5 (head + 4 body parts). So when moving, the next move will add a new head and shift the body, removing the last segment if no apple is eaten.\n\nNow, the current head is at (6,5). Possible moves: UP (6,6), DOWN (6,4), LEFT (5,5), RIGHT (7,5).\n\nCheck each direction for safety and apples:\n\nUP: (6,6). Is that a safe spot? Looking at the board state provided. The board shows rows from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom). Let's parse the board:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) is \". . . . . T 2 . . .\". So (6,5) is the head (2). The body parts are at (5,5) which is T (tail?), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Wait, the board shows at row 5 (y=5), column 6 is '2', which is the head. The body parts are at (5,5) which is 'T' (maybe tail?), (5,6) is 'T', (5,7) is 'T', (5,8) is 'T'. So moving UP to (6,6) would be row y=6. Looking at row 6 (y=6) in the board: \". . . . . T . 1 T .\". So (6,6) is column 6, row 6. The row 6 (y=6) has at column 5: T, column 7: 1 (enemy snake), column 8: T. So (6,6) is empty. So moving UP to (6,6) is safe.\n\nDOWN: (6,4). Check row 4 (y=4). The board shows \". . . . . . . A . .\". So (6,4) is column 6, row 4. There's an apple at (7,4) (column 7, row 4). So (6,4) is empty. Safe.\n\nLEFT: (5,5). The current body's first segment is (5,5), which is a 'T' on the board. So moving left would go into the snake's own body. That's a collision. So LEFT is not safe.\n\nRIGHT: (7,5). Check row 5 (y=5). The board shows at column 7: '.', so (7,5) is empty. But need to check if there's any enemy there. The enemy snake #1 is at (7,6) with body parts [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. So (7,5) is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (1,0). The closest ones are (7,4) which is two steps down from (6,5) (current head). Also, (7,2) is three steps down and left. (6,1) is four steps down. (2,3) is left and up. (1,0) is far.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5), then next move could be DOWN to (7,4) to get the apple. That's a direct path. So moving RIGHT now would get closer to (7,4).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,4) would be one step closer to (7,4) as well. From (6,4), moving RIGHT to (7,4) would get the apple. So either RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT. Which is shorter? Both are two steps. But moving RIGHT first might be better because if someone else is going for (7,4), but the enemy snake is at (7,6). Their next move could be towards (7,5) or (7,7), but not sure.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake #1 is at (7,6) with body [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. Their head is at (7,6). Possible moves for them: UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6). If they move DOWN to (7,5), then moving RIGHT to (7,5) would collide with them. So there's a risk if the enemy moves down into (7,5) the same time I move there. But since we can't predict their move, maybe it's safer to take a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,4) avoids that risk. From (6,4), moving RIGHT to (7,4) would get the apple. That path is safe as long as (7,4) is still there. But apples are static until eaten, right? So if I can reach (7,4) in two steps, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,6) might lead towards other apples, but the closest is (7,4). UP seems to take me away from the apples.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's evaluate:\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5):\n\n- Next turn, if enemy snake moves to (7,5), I die. But if they move elsewhere, I can proceed to (7,4).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,4):\n\n- Next turn, move RIGHT to (7,4) and eat the apple. Safer path, as the enemy is at (7,6) and may not be moving towards (7,4).\n\nBut the enemy's head is at (7,6). If they move DOWN to (7,5), then (7,5) is dangerous. But if I move RIGHT now, I'm at (7,5), which could be a collision if the enemy moves there. Alternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,4), then next move to (7,4) is safe.\n\nHmm. Risk assessment: moving RIGHT to (7,5) has a potential collision risk if the enemy moves down. Moving DOWN to (6,4) avoids that risk and sets up a direct path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (7,5). Let's check their possible moves. Their head is at (7,6). Their body is [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. So their possible moves from (7,6):\n\n- UP: (7,7) \u2013 empty?\nLooking at the board, row 7 (y=7) has at column 8: T. So (7,7) is empty. Safe for them.\n- DOWN: (7,5) \u2013 empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,6) \u2013 empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,6) \u2013 which is part of their body (their body is [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]). So moving RIGHT into their own body. Not allowed.\n\nSo enemy snake #1 can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If they move DOWN to (7,5), then if I move RIGHT to (7,5), we collide and both die. But if I move RIGHT and they move DOWN, that's a problem. Alternatively, if they move LEFT to (6,6), then they are moving away.\n\nBut since we can't predict their move, it's a risk. So perhaps moving DOWN to (6,4) is safer, avoiding that potential collision.\n\nAdditionally, moving DOWN to (6,4) and then RIGHT to (7,4) gets the apple. That's a two-step plan with less risk.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,5) and then DOWN to (7,4) also gets the apple. But with the risk of collision.\n\nWhich is better? It depends on the likelihood of the enemy moving to (7,5). Since the enemy's head is at (7,6), moving DOWN to (7,5) is a possible move. If they do that, and I move RIGHT into (7,5), we both die. But if they move elsewhere, I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,4), then even if the enemy moves to (7,5), I'm safe. Then next turn, I can move RIGHT to (7,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo perhaps the safer path is DOWN now, then RIGHT.\n\nBut what's the priority? To get the apple. If I can reach it in two steps either way, but with different risks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going to move DOWN. Maybe they are going for their own apple. The apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (2,3), (7,4), (1,0). The enemy's position is (7,6). The closest apple to them is (7,4) which is two steps down. So they might move DOWN twice to get it. If they move DOWN to (7,5) this turn, then next turn to (7,4). If I move RIGHT to (7,5) this turn, and they also move there, collision. But if I move DOWN to (6,4), then next turn I can get to (7,4) before them if they take two steps.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves DOWN to (7,5) this turn, then next turn they can move DOWN to (7,4). If I move RIGHT to (7,5) this turn, I die. If I move DOWN to (6,4), then next turn I can move to (7,4) and eat the apple before they do (if they are at (7,5) and move down to (7,4) the same time I do, we both collide there. But that's a risk either way.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the safest path is to go DOWN to (6,4) now, then RIGHT to (7,4) next turn. That way, even if the enemy is moving towards (7,4), I might reach it first. Alternatively, if the enemy is moving towards (7,4), they might take two steps from (7,6) to (7,5) then (7,4). If I take two steps from (6,5) to (6,4) then (7,4), I reach it on the second step. So timing-wise, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I go RIGHT to (7,5) now, and the enemy moves DOWN to (7,5), I die. If they don't, then next turn I can go DOWN to (7,4) and eat the apple.\n\nBut since we can't predict their move, perhaps the safer choice is to avoid potential collision this turn. So moving DOWN to (6,4) is safer. Then next turn, move RIGHT to (7,4) to get the apple.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,4) is in row 4, column 7. From (6,4), moving RIGHT to (7,4) is direct. So that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,5) and then DOWN to (7,4) also works. But the risk is higher this turn.\n\nGiven that the enemy's possible moves include DOWN to (7,5), which would be dangerous if I move RIGHT, I think the safer move is DOWN to (6,4) to avoid that risk. Then proceed towards the apple next turn.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo between UP, DOWN, RIGHT. UP takes me to (6,6), which is empty but away from apples. DOWN to (6,4) is closer to (7,4). RIGHT to (7,5) is closer but riskier.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (6,4) to approach the apple at (7,4) safely.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"
