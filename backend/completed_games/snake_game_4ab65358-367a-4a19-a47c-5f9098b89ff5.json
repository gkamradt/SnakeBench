The closest apple is at (0, 2), which is directly below my current position.\n2. Enemy snake #2 is at (0, 3), just below another apple.\n3. I need to navigate carefully to avoid collision with the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Move towards the (0, 2) apple\n- Be cautious of the enemy snake at (0, 3)\n- Avoid moving into walls or other snakes\n\nThinking process:\n- The safest move is to go DOWN towards the apple\n- This will allow me to potentially eat the apple at (0, 2)\n- The enemy snake is close, but moving down should not cause a collision\n\nNext turn strategy: After collecting this apple, look to navigate towards the next closest apple at (6, 4) or (7, 3).\n\nNext move: DOWN"

There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is at (0, 8).\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n- After eating the apple at (0, 2), consider moving up to (0, 4) to avoid the enemy snake and to position for the next apple at (7, 3).\n\nNext move: LEFT"
