If there's a clear path, move directly towards it.  If there's a risk of colliding with the enemy, consider a slightly different path.  Also, check for any other obstacles (walls or other snakes) in the way.  If there's no clear path to the apple, consider moving in a direction that avoids the enemy and doesn't put me in danger of hitting a wall or myself.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Moving UP would take me to (4, 8).  Moving UP again would take me to (4, 7).  Moving UP again would take me to (4, 6).  Moving UP again would take me to (4, 5).  Moving UP again would take me to (4, 4).  Moving UP again would take me to (4, 3) and I would collide with the enemy snake.  Moving UP is not a good option. Moving DOWN would take me to (4, 8).

Moving DOWN again would take me to (4, 3) and I would collide with the enemy snake.  Moving DOWN is not a good option. Moving LEFT would take me to (3, 9).  Moving LEFT again would take me to (2, 9).  Moving LEFT again would take me to (1, 9).  Moving LEFT again would take me to (0, 9).  Moving LEFT is not a good option. Moving RIGHT would take me to (5, 9).  Moving RIGHT is not a good option.  The best option seems to be moving UP.  I should also check for any other obstacles (walls or other snakes) in the way.\n\nStrategy for next turn:  Prioritize getting to the apple at (4, 1).  If there's a clear path, move directly towards it.  If there's a risk of colliding with the enemy, consider moving UP.  Also, check for any other obstacles (walls or other snakes) in the way.  If there's no clear path to the apple, consider moving in a direction that avoids the enemy and doesn't put me in danger of hitting a wall or myself.  I need to be more careful about the enemy's position.\n\nNext move: UP"
