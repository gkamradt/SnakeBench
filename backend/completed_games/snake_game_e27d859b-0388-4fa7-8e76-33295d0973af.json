The apple at (0, 0) is closest after reaching the top row.\n\n3. **Long-term Strategy:**\n   - Monitor Snake #2\u2019s movements, especially if it starts to head towards any particular apple. This will influence my strategic choices concerning priority of apples.\n   - Maintain flexibility by considering paths that avoid corners and keep escape options open, ensuring I do not corner myself as I grow in length.\n\n4. **Potential Challenges:**\n   - Need to maintain situational awareness as Snake #2 could pivot towards my path at any moment. React quickly if it starts heading towards an apple I am aiming for.\n\n**Decided Move: UP**"

I've already moved up, getting closer to this apple. My path is straightforward, with no obstructions warranted from either the walls or Snake #2.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake Analysis:**\n   - Snake #2 remains at (6, 6) and continues to pose no immediate threat to me. Its current path doesn't intersect with mine, allowing me to focus on reaching the apple at (0, 9).\n\n3. **Opportunities and Threats:**\n   - The apples at (9, 3) and (7, 7) are distant and would require navigating cross or diagonal boards, increasing risk of unnecessary confrontation or cornering myself. \n   - The apple at (0, 0) will be my target once I secure the apple at (0, 9), facilitating continuous movement rather than abrupt directional changes.\n\n### Decision & Strategy:\n\n1. **Immediate Move:**\n   - I'll **Move Up to (0, 6)**, maintaining my path towards the apple at (0, 9). This keeps my strategy simple and straightforward, reducing analysis paralysis with more complex maneuvers.\n\n2. **Short-term Strategy:**\n   - Continue tracking the apple at (0, 9), checking Snake #2\u2019s actions concurrently. Secure this apple, then assess immediate priorities concerning movement towards apple (0, 0) or shifting strategies to other apples, contingent on emerging threats or opportunities.\n\n3. **Long-term Strategy:**\n   - Keep a watch on Snake #2 as it moves. Reactivity will be key if Snake #2 moves towards an apple I'm heading for.\n   - Preserve flexibility by avoiding immediate board edges and enabling potential escape paths.\n\n4. **Potential Challenges:**\n   - Stay vigilant and monitor potential positional pivots by Snake #2 since their mobility might influence key apple pursuits.\n   - Ensure my own path doesn\u2019t result in self-cornering as more apples are collected and the body lengthens.\n\n**Decided Move: UP**"

It poses no immediate threat, but it's important to be aware of its future movements, especially if it seeks apples.\n\n3. **Apple Analysis and Options:**\n   - The apple at (0, 0) is accessible once the apple at (0, 9) is secured. \n   - Apples located at (9, 3) and (7, 7) are less favorable for immediate targeting due to their positions across the board and potential risk in traversal.\n\n### Decision & Strategy for This Turn:\n\n1. **Immediate Move:**\n   - **Move Up to (0, 7)** to continue moving towards the apple at (0, 9).
