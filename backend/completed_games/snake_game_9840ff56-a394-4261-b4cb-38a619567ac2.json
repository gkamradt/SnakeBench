There are apples at (0,8), (3,6), (3,1), (4,7), and (5,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,8): Row 0, Column 8\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (3,1): Row 3, Column 1\n\n- (4,7): Row 4, Column 7\n\n- (5,5): Row 5, Column 5\n\nMy position is (1,2): Row 1, Column 2\n\nEnemy snake is Snake #1 at (9,8), but its body is empty, which probably means it's just the head at that position.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since this is a multi-apple snake game, I can eat multiple apples in one go if I plan my path correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the distances to each apple and see which one is closest. Then, I can think about which apple to go for first and how to navigate there without running into anything.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple, since we can't move diagonally in snake games.\n\nManhattan distance is |dx| + |dy|\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 1 - 0 = 1\n\ndy = 2 - 8 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 6 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTo (3,1):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 1 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 1 - 4 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\ndy = 2 - 7 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTo (5,5):\n\ndx = 1 - 5 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\ndy = 2 - 5 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest are (3,6) at distance 6, and (0,8) and (5,5) at distance 7, and (4,7) at distance 8.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (3,1) first.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the path to (3,1) is clear and doesn't involve running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, but my snake is just the head at (1,2), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,8), and its body is empty, so only the head is there.\n\nI need to avoid that position.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't go outside the board boundaries.\n\nSo, let's plan a path to (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2), to (3,1):\n\nFirst, I need to increase x from 1 to 3, and decrease y from 2 to 1.\n\nSo, move right twice, and down once.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nAt (2,2): empty\n\nAt (3,2): empty (since there's an apple at (3,1), but (3,2) is empty)\n\nAt (3,1): apple\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nWait, but the apple at (3,1) is at (3,1), so if I move to (3,1), I eat it and grow.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating this apple, I don't immediately run into something.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be:\n\n- previous head at (1,2)\n\n- new head at (3,1)\n\nBut, since I'm just starting, my tail won't be growing yet.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake length increases.\n\nBut in this game, it's not specified how the growth works.\n\nI think, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nBut in this game, it might be different.\n\nWait, in the rules it says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how growth works, but in standard snake, growth means your tail extends by one segment.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can eat multiple apples in one go, I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so you need to make sure that your head moves to the apple, and your tail extends accordingly.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I can assume that eating an apple increases my snake's length by one segment.\n\nBut in this initial stage, my snake is just the head at (1,2), so eating an apple at (3,1) would make my snake have two segments: the previous head at (1,2), and the new head at (3,1).\n\nSo, now, my snake is two segments: (1,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, if I move to another apple, I need to make sure that my head's new position doesn't collide with my tail at (1,2).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of paths: plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without crossing my own path or running into the enemy.\n\nBut, planning a full path might be too much for now.\n\nPerhaps I should just focus on eating the closest apple first, which is (3,1), and then reassess from there.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move right to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\nBut, looking at the board, there's an apple at (3,1), but no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (9,8), which is far away, so it shouldn't be a problem for now.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that the enemy might move, but perhaps for this turn, I can assume it stays put.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFirst, move right to (2,2):\n\nIs (2,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move right to (3,2):\n\nIs (3,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move down to (3,1):\n\nIs (3,1) occupied? Yes, by an apple.\n\nSo, I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is now two segments: (2,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (0,8), (3,6), (4,7), (5,5).\n\nNow, my head is at (3,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances to remaining apples.\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 3 - 0 = 3\n\ndy = 1 - 8 = 7 \u2192 |7| = 7\n\nTotal: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 3 - 3 = 0\n\ndy = 1 - 6 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 3 - 4 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\ndy = 1 - 7 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 ="

The key is to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy, or myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board again:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: A (apple at 0,8), dots, 1 (enemy at 8,8)\n\n- Row 7: dots, A (apple at 3,6)\n\n- Row 6: dots, A (apple at 3,1)\n\n- Row 5: dots, A (apple at 5,5)\n\n- Row 4: dots\n\n- Row 3: dots, 2 (me at 1,3)\n\n- Row 2: dots\n\n- Row 1: dots, A (apple at 3,1)\n\n- Row 0: dots\n\nWait, there seems to be a confusion in the board description. The apple at (3,1) appears in row 1 and row 6, which might be a typo. Let's refer back to the initial information:\n\nApples are at (0,8), (3,6), (3,1), (4,7), (5,5). I'm at (1,3).\n\nLooking at the board, I need to decide which apple to go for first. In my previous move, I considered going for the closest apple, which was (3,1), but maybe I should recalculate based on the current position.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,8): |1-0| + |3-8| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (3,6): |1-3| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- To (3,1): |1-3| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (4,7): |1-4| + |3-7| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- To (5,5): |1-5| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of other apples and potential paths that allow me to eat multiple apples in sequence without running into obstacles.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- (0,8) is top-left\n\n- (3,6) is middle-left\n\n- (3,1) is bottom-middle\n\n- (4,7) is middle-right\n\n- (5,5) is middle-middle\n\nMy current position is (1,3), which is bottom-middle.\n\nIf I go for (3,1), which is closer, I can move right twice and down once.\n\nBut, after eating (3,1), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move doesn't collide with my own body.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (3,6), which is closer in distance than (0,8) and (5,5), and see if I can chain eating multiple apples.\n\nLet me consider the path to (3,6):\n\nFrom (1,3), I need to move right twice to (3,3), then up three times to (3,6). That's a total of two rights and three ups.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): empty\n\n- (3,6): apple\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake would grow, so I need to ensure that my next move doesn't hit my own body.\n\nFrom (3,6), the nearest apple is (4,7): right once, up once.\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,7): apple\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,7), the nearest apple is (5,5): down two, left one.\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,5): empty\n\n- (5,5): apple\n\nAgain, clear.\n\nThen, from (5,5), I could go to (0,8), but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could go to (3,1), but that's a bit far from (5,5).\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize eating (3,1) earlier.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I go for (3,1) first:\n\nFrom (1,3), move right twice to (3,3), then down two to (3,1).\n\nPath:\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): empty\n\n- (3,1): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is at (3,1) and (3,2).\n\nThen, I can go for (3,6):\n\nFrom (3,1), up five times to (3,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that my tail is not in the way.\n\nWait, after eating (3,1), my snake has two segments: (3,2) and (3,1).\n\nIf I move up to (3,2), that would be moving back to my tail, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. Moving up from (3,1) to (3,2), but (3,2) is already part of my snake, so that's invalid.\n\nSo, I can't move up immediately after eating (3,1), because that would be moving back onto my tail.\n\nTherefore, going for (3,1) first might not be the best idea, as it limits my next moves.\n\nHence, perhaps going for (3,6) first is better.\n\nFrom (1,3), move right twice to (3,3), then up three times to (3,6).\n\nPath is clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake is at (3,3) and (3,6).\n\nThen, I can move to (4,7):\n\nRight to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,7): apple\n\nAfter eating (4,7), my snake is at (3,3), (3,6), and (4,7).\n\nThen, I can move to (5,5):\n\nDown to (4,6), down to (4,5), left to (3,5), down to (3,4), etc.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should try to eat the apples in a way that allows me to cover the board efficiently without trapping myself.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (0,8) is top-left\n\n- (3,6) is middle-left\n\n- (3,1) is bottom-middle\n\n- (4,7) is middle-right\n\n- (5,5) is middle-middle\n\nIf I start by going up to (3,6), then right to (4,7), then down to (5,5), then perhaps to (3,1), and finally to (0,8).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't cause my snake to block itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim to eat (3,1) first, but as I saw earlier, it limits my next moves.\n\nWait, maybe I can eat (3,1), then move right to (4,1), then up to (4,2), etc., to avoid hitting my tail.\n\nBut, it's getting too complicated for just one move.\n\nI need to decide what to do for the next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to move towards the closest apple, which is (3,1), by moving right to (2,3).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving right to (3,3), then down to (3,2), and finally to (3,1).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating (3,1), I have a path to another apple without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (3,6) first, which seems to offer a clearer path to other apples.\n\nConsidering the potential paths, I think going for (3,6) is a better strategy.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll move right to (2,3).\n\nNext turn, I'll move right again to (3,3), then up to (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, I can proceed to (4,7), and so on.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this move is to move right to (2,3).\n\n**Final Move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,2). There are apples at (0,8), (3,6), (3,1), (4,7), and (5,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,8): Row 0, Column 8\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (3,1): Row 3, Column 1\n\n- (4,7): Row 4, Column 7\n\n- (5,5): Row 5, Column 5\n\nMy position is (1,2): Row 1, Column 2\n\nEnemy snake is Snake #1 at (9,8), but its body is empty, which probably means it's just the head at that position.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since this is a multi-apple snake game, I can eat multiple apples in one go if I plan my path correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the distances to each apple and see which one is closest. Then, I can think about which apple to go for first and how to navigate there without running into anything.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple, since we can't move diagonally in snake games.\n\nManhattan distance is |dx| + |dy|\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 1 - 0 = 1\n\ndy = 2 - 8 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 6 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTo (3,1):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 1 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 1 - 4 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\ndy = 2 - 7 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTo (5,5):\n\ndx = 1 - 5 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\ndy = 2 - 5 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest are (3,6) at distance 6, and (0,8) and (5,5) at distance 7, and (4,7) at distance 8.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (3,1) first.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the path to (3,1) is clear and doesn't involve running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, but my snake is just the head at (1,2), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,8), and its body is empty, so only the head is there.\n\nI need to avoid that position.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't go outside the board boundaries.\n\nSo, let's plan a path to (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2), to (3,1):\n\nFirst, I need to increase x from 1 to 3, and decrease y from 2 to 1.\n\nSo, move right twice, and down once.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nAt (2,2): empty\n\nAt (3,2): empty (since there's an apple at (3,1), but (3,2) is empty)\n\nAt (3,1): apple\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nWait, but the apple at (3,1) is at (3,1), so if I move to (3,1), I eat it and grow.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating this apple, I don't immediately run into something.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be:\n\n- previous head at (1,2)\n\n- new head at (3,1)\n\nBut, since I'm just starting, my tail won't be growing yet.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake length increases.\n\nBut in this game, it's not specified how the growth works.\n\nI think, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nBut in this game, it might be different.\n\nWait, in the rules it says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how growth works, but in standard snake, growth means your tail extends by one segment.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can eat multiple apples in one go, I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so you need to make sure that your head moves to the apple, and your tail extends accordingly.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I can assume that eating an apple increases my snake's length by one segment.\n\nBut in this initial stage, my snake is just the head at (1,2), so eating an apple at (3,1) would make my snake have two segments: the previous head at (1,2), and the new head at (3,1).\n\nSo, now, my snake is two segments: (1,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, if I move to another apple, I need to make sure that my head's new position doesn't collide with my tail at (1,2).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of paths: plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without crossing my own path or running into the enemy.\n\nBut, planning a full path might be too much for now.\n\nPerhaps I should just focus on eating the closest apple first, which is (3,1), and then reassess from there.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move right to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\nBut, looking at the board, there's an apple at (3,1), but no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (9,8), which is far away, so it shouldn't be a problem for now.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that the enemy might move, but perhaps for this turn, I can assume it stays put.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFirst, move right to (2,2):\n\nIs (2,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move right to (3,2):\n\nIs (3,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move down to (3,1):\n\nIs (3,1) occupied? Yes, by an apple.\n\nSo, I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is now two segments: (2,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (0,8), (3,6), (4,7), (5,5).\n\nNow, my head is at (3,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances to remaining apples.\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 3 - 0 = 3\n\ndy = 1 - 8 = 7 \u2192 |7| = 7\n\nTotal: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 3 - 3 = 0\n\ndy = 1 - 6 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 3 - 4 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\ndy = 1 - 7 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 ="

There are apples at (0,8), (3,6), (3,1), (4,7), and (5,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . .

Since this is a multi-apple snake game, I can eat multiple apples in one go if I plan my path correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the distances to each apple and see which one is closest. Then, I can think about which apple to go for first and how to navigate there without running into anything.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple, since we can't move diagonally in snake games.\n\nManhattan distance is |dx| + |dy|\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 1 - 0 = 1\n\ndy = 2 - 8 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 6 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTo (3,1):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 1 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 1 - 4 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\ndy = 2 - 7 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTo (5,5):\n\ndx = 1 - 5 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\ndy = 2 - 5 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest are (3,6) at distance 6, and (0,8) and (5,5) at distance 7, and (4,7) at distance 8.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (3,1) first.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the path to (3,1) is clear and doesn't involve running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, but my snake is just the head at (1,2), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,8), and its body is empty, so only the head is there.\n\nI need to avoid that position.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't go outside the board boundaries.\n\nSo, let's plan a path to (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2), to (3,1):\n\nFirst, I need to increase x from 1 to 3, and decrease y from 2 to 1.\n\nSo, move right twice, and down once.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nAt (2,2): empty\n\nAt (3,2): empty (since there's an apple at (3,1), but (3,2) is empty)\n\nAt (3,1): apple\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nWait, but the apple at (3,1) is at (3,1), so if I move to (3,1), I eat it and grow.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating this apple, I don't immediately run into something.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be:\n\n- previous head at (1,2)\n\n- new head at (3,1)\n\nBut, since I'm just starting, my tail won't be growing yet.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake length increases.\n\nBut in this game, it's not specified how the growth works.\n\nI think, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nBut in this game, it might be different.\n\nWait, in the rules it says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how growth works, but in standard snake, growth means your tail extends by one segment.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can eat multiple apples in one go, I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so you need to make sure that your head moves to the apple, and your tail extends accordingly.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I can assume that eating an apple increases my snake's length by one segment.\n\nBut in this initial stage, my snake is just the head at (1,2), so eating an apple at (3,1) would make my snake have two segments: the previous head at (1,2), and the new head at (3,1).\n\nSo, now, my snake is two segments: (1,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, if I move to another apple, I need to make sure that my head's new position doesn't collide with my tail at (1,2).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of paths: plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without crossing my own path or running into the enemy.\n\nBut, planning a full path might be too much for now.\n\nPerhaps I should just focus on eating the closest apple first, which is (3,1), and then reassess from there.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move right to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\nBut, looking at the board, there's an apple at (3,1), but no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (9,8), which is far away, so it shouldn't be a problem for now.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that the enemy might move, but perhaps for this turn, I can assume it stays put.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFirst, move right to (2,2):\n\nIs (2,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move right to (3,2):\n\nIs (3,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move down to (3,1):\n\nIs (3,1) occupied? Yes, by an apple.\n\nSo, I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is now two segments: (2,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (0,8), (3,6), (4,7), (5,5).\n\nNow, my head is at (3,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances to remaining apples.\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 3 - 0 = 3\n\ndy = 1 - 8 = 7 \u2192 |7| = 7\n\nTotal: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 3 - 3 = 0\n\ndy = 1 - 6 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 3 - 4 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\ndy = 1 - 7 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 ="

So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,8): Row 0, Column 8\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (3,1): Row 3, Column 1\n\n- (4,7): Row 4, Column 7\n\n- (5,5): Row 5, Column 5\n\nMy position is (1,2): Row 1, Column 2\n\nEnemy snake is Snake #1 at (9,8), but its body is empty, which probably means it's just the head at that position.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since this is a multi-apple snake game, I can eat multiple apples in one go if I plan my path correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the distances to each apple and see which one is closest. Then, I can think about which apple to go for first and how to navigate there without running into anything.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple, since we can't move diagonally in snake games.\n\nManhattan distance is |dx| + |dy|\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 1 - 0 = 1\n\ndy = 2 - 8 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 6 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTo (3,1):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 1 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 1 - 4 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\ndy = 2 - 7 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTo (5,5):\n\ndx = 1 - 5 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\ndy = 2 - 5 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest are (3,6) at distance 6, and (0,8) and (5,5) at distance 7, and (4,7) at distance 8.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (3,1) first.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the path to (3,1) is clear and doesn't involve running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, but my snake is just the head at (1,2), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,8), and its body is empty, so only the head is there.\n\nI need to avoid that position.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't go outside the board boundaries.\n\nSo, let's plan a path to (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2), to (3,1):\n\nFirst, I need to increase x from 1 to 3, and decrease y from 2 to 1.\n\nSo, move right twice, and down once.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nAt (2,2): empty\n\nAt (3,2): empty (since there's an apple at (3,1), but (3,2) is empty)\n\nAt (3,1): apple\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nWait, but the apple at (3,1) is at (3,1), so if I move to (3,1), I eat it and grow.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating this apple, I don't immediately run into something.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be:\n\n- previous head at (1,2)\n\n- new head at (3,1)\n\nBut, since I'm just starting, my tail won't be growing yet.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake length increases.\n\nBut in this game, it's not specified how the growth works.\n\nI think, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nBut in this game, it might be different.\n\nWait, in the rules it says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how growth works, but in standard snake, growth means your tail extends by one segment.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can eat multiple apples in one go, I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so you need to make sure that your head moves to the apple, and your tail extends accordingly.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I can assume that eating an apple increases my snake's length by one segment.\n\nBut in this initial stage, my snake is just the head at (1,2), so eating an apple at (3,1) would make my snake have two segments: the previous head at (1,2), and the new head at (3,1).\n\nSo, now, my snake is two segments: (1,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, if I move to another apple, I need to make sure that my head's new position doesn't collide with my tail at (1,2).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of paths: plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without crossing my own path or running into the enemy.\n\nBut, planning a full path might be too much for now.\n\nPerhaps I should just focus on eating the closest apple first, which is (3,1), and then reassess from there.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move right to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\nBut, looking at the board, there's an apple at (3,1), but no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (9,8), which is far away, so it shouldn't be a problem for now.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that the enemy might move, but perhaps for this turn, I can assume it stays put.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFirst, move right to (2,2):\n\nIs (2,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move right to (3,2):\n\nIs (3,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move down to (3,1):\n\nIs (3,1) occupied? Yes, by an apple.\n\nSo, I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is now two segments: (2,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (0,8), (3,6), (4,7), (5,5).\n\nNow, my head is at (3,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances to remaining apples.\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 3 - 0 = 3\n\ndy = 1 - 8 = 7 \u2192 |7| = 7\n\nTotal: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 3 - 3 = 0\n\ndy = 1 - 6 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 3 - 4 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\ndy = 1 - 7 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 ="

The key is to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy, or myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board again:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: A (apple at 0,8), dots, 1 (enemy at 7,8)\n\n- Row 7: dots, A (apple at 3,6)\n\n- Row 6: dots, A (apple at 3,1)\n\n- Row 5: dots, A (apple at 5,5)\n\n- Row 4: dots\n\n- Row 3: dots, 2 (me at 3,3)\n\n- Row 2: dots\n\n- Row 1: dots, A (apple at 3,1)\n\n- Row 0: dots\n\nWait, there seems to be a confusion in the board description. The apple at (3,1) appears in row 1 and row 6, which might be a typo. Let's refer back to the initial information:\n\nApples are at (0,8), (3,6), (3,1), (4,7), and (5,5). I'm at (3,3).\n\nLooking at the board, I need to decide which apple to go for first. In my previous move, I considered going for the closest apple, which was (3,1), but maybe I should recalculate based on the current position.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,8): |3-0| + |3-8| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- To (3,6): |3-3| + |3-6| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (3,1): |3-3| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- To (4,7): |3-4| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- To (5,5): |3-5| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 2.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of other apples and potential paths that allow me to eat multiple apples in sequence without running into obstacles.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- (0,8) is top-left\n\n- (3,6) is middle-left\n\n- (3,1) is bottom-middle\n\n- (4,7) is middle-right\n\n- (5,5) is middle-middle\n\nMy current position is (3,3), which is middle-middle.\n\nIf I go for (3,1), which is closer, I can move down twice.\n\nBut, after eating (3,1), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move doesn't collide with my own body.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (3,6), which is also vertical, and see if I can chain eating multiple apples.\n\nLet me consider the path to (3,6):\n\nFrom (3,3), I need to move up three times to (3,6). That's straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): empty\n\n- (3,6): apple\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake would grow, so I need to ensure that my next move doesn't hit my own body.\n\nFrom (3,6), the nearest apple is (4,7): right once, up once.\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,7): apple\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,7), the nearest apple is (5,5): down two, left one.\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,5): empty\n\n- (5,5): apple\n\nAgain, clear.\n\nThen, from (5,5), I could go to (0,8), but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could go to (3,1), but that's a bit far from (5,5).\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize eating (3,1) earlier.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I go for (3,1) first:\n\nFrom (3,3), move down twice to (3,1).\n\nPath:\n\n- (3,2): empty\n\n- (3,1): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is at (3,3) and (3,1).\n\nThen, I can go for (3,6):\n\nFrom (3,1), up five times to (3,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that my tail is not in the way.\n\nWait, after eating (3,1), my snake has two segments: (3,3) and (3,1). If I move up to (3,2), then (3,3) moves to (3,2), but (3,2) is not yet occupied by my snake. Wait, no, the tail would be at (3,1), and the head at (3,2), then (3,3) would move to (3,2), but that's where the head is, which is invalid.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe going for (3,6) first is simpler.\n\nFrom (3,3), move up to (3,4), then up to (3,5), and up to (3,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake is at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6).\n\nThen, I can move right to (4,6), then up to (4,7) to eat the next apple.\n\nFrom (4,7), I can move down to (4,6), then down to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), etc., to get to (5,5).\n\nThis seems more manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim to eat (3,1), then (5,5), then (4,7), but the path is less straightforward.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (3,6) first is a better strategy.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll move up to (3,4).\n\nNext turn, I'll move up to (3,5), then up to (3,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, I can proceed to (4,7), and so on.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this move is to move up to (3,4).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

That's straightforward.\n\nChecking the path:\n\n- (3,5): empty\n\n- (3,6): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake will be at (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6).\n\nThen, I can consider moving to (4,7).

If I move down from (4,7) to (4,6), which is part of my body, that's invalid.\n\nSo, I need to find another path.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,7), I could move right to (5,7), but there's no apple there, and it might not be useful.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nLet me try going for (5,5) after (3,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move right to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (5,5).\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\n- (5,5): apple\n\nAfter eating (5,5), my snake will be at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (5,5).\n\nThen, I can aim for (4,7).

After moving, my snake would be at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and (3,2), which is invalid because (3,2) is already occupied.\n\nWait, no. When I move up from (3,1) to (3,2), my tail moves from (3,1) to (3,2), but that's where the head is going, which is invalid.\n\nThis is getting messy. Maybe going for (3,1) first isn't the best idea.\n\nLet me consider going for (5,5) directly from (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), move right to (4,4), then right to (5,4), then up to (5,5).\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): apple\n\nAfter eating (5,5), my snake will be at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), and (5,5).\n\nThen, I can move to (4,5), then to (4,6), then to (4,7) to eat the apple there.\n\n- (4,5): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,7): apple\n\nThis seems clearer.\n\nAfter eating (4,7), my snake will be at (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), and (4,7).\n\nThen, I can aim for (3,6). From (4,7), move left to (3,7), then down to (3,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- (3,7): empty\n\n- (3,6): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake will be at (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), and (3,6).\n\nThen, I can move to (2,6), then to (1,6), then to (0,6), then left to (0,5), etc., but this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe there's a better sequence.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,8) first, but that's quite far away.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving left to (2,4), then left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then up to (0,5), then up to (0,6), then up to (0,7), then up to (0,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might run into the enemy or my own body along the way.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick"

There are apples at (0,8), (3,6), (3,1), (4,7), and (5,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,8): Row 0, Column 8\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (3,1): Row 3, Column 1\n\n- (4,7): Row 4, Column 7\n\n- (5,5): Row 5, Column 5\n\nMy position is (1,2): Row 1, Column 2\n\nEnemy snake is Snake #1 at (9,8), but its body is empty, which probably means it's just the head at that position.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since this is a multi-apple snake game, I can eat multiple apples in one go if I plan my path correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the distances to each apple and see which one is closest. Then, I can think about which apple to go for first and how to navigate there without running into anything.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple, since we can't move diagonally in snake games.\n\nManhattan distance is |dx| + |dy|\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 1 - 0 = 1\n\ndy = 2 - 8 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 6 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTo (3,1):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 1 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 1 - 4 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\ndy = 2 - 7 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTo (5,5):\n\ndx = 1 - 5 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\ndy = 2 - 5 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest are (3,6) at distance 6, and (0,8) and (5,5) at distance 7, and (4,7) at distance 8.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (3,1) first.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the path to (3,1) is clear and doesn't involve running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, but my snake is just the head at (1,2), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,8), and its body is empty, so only the head is there.\n\nI need to avoid that position.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't go outside the board boundaries.\n\nSo, let's plan a path to (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2), to (3,1):\n\nFirst, I need to increase x from 1 to 3, and decrease y from 2 to 1.\n\nSo, move right twice, and down once.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nAt (2,2): empty\n\nAt (3,2): empty (since there's an apple at (3,1), but (3,2) is empty)\n\nAt (3,1): apple\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nWait, but the apple at (3,1) is at (3,1), so if I move to (3,1), I eat it and grow.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating this apple, I don't immediately run into something.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be:\n\n- previous head at (1,2)\n\n- new head at (3,1)\n\nBut, since I'm just starting, my tail won't be growing yet.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake length increases.\n\nBut in this game, it's not specified how the growth works.\n\nI think, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nBut in this game, it might be different.\n\nWait, in the rules it says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how growth works, but in standard snake, growth means your tail extends by one segment.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can eat multiple apples in one go, I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so you need to make sure that your head moves to the apple, and your tail extends accordingly.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I can assume that eating an apple increases my snake's length by one segment.\n\nBut in this initial stage, my snake is just the head at (1,2), so eating an apple at (3,1) would make my snake have two segments: the previous head at (1,2), and the new head at (3,1).\n\nSo, now, my snake is two segments: (1,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, if I move to another apple, I need to make sure that my head's new position doesn't collide with my tail at (1,2).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of paths: plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without crossing my own path or running into the enemy.\n\nBut, planning a full path might be too much for now.\n\nPerhaps I should just focus on eating the closest apple first, which is (3,1), and then reassess from there.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move right to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\nBut, looking at the board, there's an apple at (3,1), but no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (9,8), which is far away, so it shouldn't be a problem for now.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that the enemy might move, but perhaps for this turn, I can assume it stays put.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFirst, move right to (2,2):\n\nIs (2,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move right to (3,2):\n\nIs (3,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move down to (3,1):\n\nIs (3,1) occupied? Yes, by an apple.\n\nSo, I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is now two segments: (2,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (0,8), (3,6), (4,7), (5,5).\n\nNow, my head is at (3,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances to remaining apples.\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 3 - 0 = 3\n\ndy = 1 - 8 = 7 \u2192 |7| = 7\n\nTotal: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 3 - 3 = 0\n\ndy = 1 - 6 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 3 - 4 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\ndy = 1 - 7 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 ="

The apple at (3,1) appears in row 1 and row 6, which might be a typo. Let's refer back to the initial information:\n\nApples are at (0,8), (3,6), (3,1), (4,7), and (5,5). I'm at (3,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I need to decide which apple to go for first. In my previous move, I considered going for the closest apple, which was (3,1), but maybe I should recalculate based on the current position.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (3,4) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,8): |3-0| + |4-8| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- To (3,6): |3-3| + |4-6| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- To (3,1): |3-3| + |4-1| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (4,7): |3-4| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (5,5): |3-5| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,6) with a distance of 2.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of other apples and potential paths that allow me to eat multiple apples in sequence without running into obstacles.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- (0,8) is top-left\n\n- (3,6) is middle-left\n\n- (3,1) is bottom-middle\n\n- (4,7) is middle-right\n\n- (5,5) is middle-middle\n\nMy current position is (3,4), which is middle-middle.\n\nIf I go for (3,6), which is closer, I can move up twice.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with my own body.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,5), which is also nearby, but (3,6) is closer.\n\nLet me consider the path to (3,6):\n\nFrom (3,4), move up to (3,5), then up to (3,6). That's straightforward.\n\nChecking the path:\n\n- (3,5): empty\n\n- (3,6): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake will be at (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6).\n\nThen, I can consider moving to (4,7). From (3,6), I would need to move right to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,7): apple\n\nAfter eating (4,7), my snake will be at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), and (4,7).\n\nNext, I can move to (5,5). From (4,7), I would need to move down to (4,6), then down to (4,5), then right to (5,5).\n\n- (4,6): part of my body\n\nWait, that's a problem. If I move down from (4,7) to (4,6), which is part of my body, that's invalid.\n\nSo, I need to find another path.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,7), I could move right to (5,7), but there's no apple there, and it might not be useful.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should consider a different sequence.\n\nLet me try going for (5,5) after (3,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move right to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (5,5).\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\n- (5,5): apple\n\nAfter eating (5,5), my snake will be at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (5,5).\n\nThen, I can aim for (4,7). From (5,5), I would need to move up to (5,6), then left to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\n- (5,6): part of my body\n\n- (4,6): part of my body\n\n- (4,7): apple\n\nAgain, moving through my own body is invalid.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet me think about going for (3,1) first.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): empty\n\n- (3,1): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and (3,1).\n\nThen, I can move up to (3,2), but that's where my tail is, which is now at (3,1). After moving, my snake would be at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and (3,2), which is invalid because (3,2) is already occupied.\n\nWait, no. When I move up from (3,1) to (3,2), my tail moves from (3,1) to (3,2), but that's where the head is going, which is invalid.\n\nThis is getting messy. Maybe going for (3,1) first isn't the best idea.\n\nLet me consider going for (5,5) directly from (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), move right to (4,4), then right to (5,4), then up to (5,5).\n\n- (4,4): empty\n\n- (5,4): empty\n\n- (5,5): apple\n\nAfter eating (5,5), my snake will be at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), and (5,5).\n\nThen, I can move to (4,5), then to (4,6), then to (4,7) to eat the apple there.\n\n- (4,5): empty\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,7): apple\n\nThis seems clearer.\n\nAfter eating (4,7), my snake will be at (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), and (4,7).\n\nThen, I can aim for (3,6). From (4,7), move left to (3,7), then down to (3,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- (3,7): empty\n\n- (3,6): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake will be at (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), and (3,6).\n\nThen, I can move to (2,6), then to (1,6), then to (0,6), then left to (0,5), etc., but this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe there's a better sequence.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,8) first, but that's quite far away.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving left to (2,4), then left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then up to (0,5), then up to (0,6), then up to (0,7), then up to (0,8).\n\nThat's a long path, and I might run into the enemy or my own body along the way.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to stick"

There are apples at (0,8), (3,6), (3,1), (4,7), and (5,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: A . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,8): Row 0, Column 8\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (3,1): Row 3, Column 1\n\n- (4,7): Row 4, Column 7\n\n- (5,5): Row 5, Column 5\n\nMy position is (1,2): Row 1, Column 2\n\nEnemy snake is Snake #1 at (9,8), but its body is empty, which probably means it's just the head at that position.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since this is a multi-apple snake game, I can eat multiple apples in one go if I plan my path correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the distances to each apple and see which one is closest. Then, I can think about which apple to go for first and how to navigate there without running into anything.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple, since we can't move diagonally in snake games.\n\nManhattan distance is |dx| + |dy|\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 1 - 0 = 1\n\ndy = 2 - 8 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 = 7\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 6 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTo (3,1):\n\ndx = 1 - 3 = 2 \u2192 |2| = 2\n\ndy = 2 - 1 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 1 - 4 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\ndy = 2 - 7 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTo (5,5):\n\ndx = 1 - 5 = 4 \u2192 |4| = 4\n\ndy = 2 - 5 = 3 \u2192 |3| = 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest are (3,6) at distance 6, and (0,8) and (5,5) at distance 7, and (4,7) at distance 8.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (3,1) first.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the path to (3,1) is clear and doesn't involve running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, but my snake is just the head at (1,2), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,8), and its body is empty, so only the head is there.\n\nI need to avoid that position.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't go outside the board boundaries.\n\nSo, let's plan a path to (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2), to (3,1):\n\nFirst, I need to increase x from 1 to 3, and decrease y from 2 to 1.\n\nSo, move right twice, and down once.\n\nBut, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nAt (2,2): empty\n\nAt (3,2): empty (since there's an apple at (3,1), but (3,2) is empty)\n\nAt (3,1): apple\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nWait, but the apple at (3,1) is at (3,1), so if I move to (3,1), I eat it and grow.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating this apple, I don't immediately run into something.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be:\n\n- previous head at (1,2)\n\n- new head at (3,1)\n\nBut, since I'm just starting, my tail won't be growing yet.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake length increases.\n\nBut in this game, it's not specified how the growth works.\n\nI think, in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nBut in this game, it might be different.\n\nWait, in the rules it says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how growth works, but in standard snake, growth means your tail extends by one segment.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and you can eat multiple apples in one go, I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so you need to make sure that your head moves to the apple, and your tail extends accordingly.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I can assume that eating an apple increases my snake's length by one segment.\n\nBut in this initial stage, my snake is just the head at (1,2), so eating an apple at (3,1) would make my snake have two segments: the previous head at (1,2), and the new head at (3,1).\n\nSo, now, my snake is two segments: (1,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, if I move to another apple, I need to make sure that my head's new position doesn't collide with my tail at (1,2).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of paths: plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without crossing my own path or running into the enemy.\n\nBut, planning a full path might be too much for now.\n\nPerhaps I should just focus on eating the closest apple first, which is (3,1), and then reassess from there.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move right to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\nBut, looking at the board, there's an apple at (3,1), but no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (9,8), which is far away, so it shouldn't be a problem for now.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that the enemy might move, but perhaps for this turn, I can assume it stays put.\n\nSo, moving to (3,1):\n\nFirst, move right to (2,2):\n\nIs (2,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move right to (3,2):\n\nIs (3,2) occupied? No.\n\nThen, move down to (3,1):\n\nIs (3,1) occupied? Yes, by an apple.\n\nSo, I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is now two segments: (2,2) and (3,1).\n\nNow, I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (0,8), (3,6), (4,7), (5,5).\n\nNow, my head is at (3,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances to remaining apples.\n\nTo (0,8):\n\ndx = 3 - 0 = 3\n\ndy = 1 - 8 = 7 \u2192 |7| = 7\n\nTotal: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nTo (3,6):\n\ndx = 3 - 3 = 0\n\ndy = 1 - 6 = 5 \u2192 |5| = 5\n\nTotal: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nTo (4,7):\n\ndx = 3 - 4 = 1 \u2192 |1| = 1\n\ndy = 1 - 7 = 6 \u2192 |6| = 6\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 ="

In my previous move, I considered going for the closest apple, which was (3,1), but maybe I should recalculate based on the current position.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,8): |3-0| + |3-8| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n- To (3,6): |3-3| + |3-6| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (3,1): |3-3| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- To (4,7): |3-4| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- To (5,5): |3-5| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,1) with a distance of 2.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of other apples and potential paths that allow me to eat multiple apples in sequence without running into obstacles.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- (0,8) is top-left\n\n- (3,6) is middle-left\n\n- (3,1) is bottom-middle\n\n- (4,7) is middle-right\n\n- (5,5) is middle-middle\n\nMy current position is (3,3), which is middle-middle.\n\nIf I go for (3,1), which is closer, I can move down twice.\n\nBut, after eating (3,1), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move doesn't collide with my own body.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (3,6), which is also vertical, and see if I can chain eating multiple apples.\n\nLet me consider the path to (3,6):\n\nFrom (3,3), I need to move up three times to (3,6). That's straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,5): empty\n\n- (3,6): apple\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake would grow, so I need to ensure that my next move doesn't hit my own body.\n\nFrom (3,6), the nearest apple is (4,7): right once, up once.\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,7): apple\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,7), the nearest apple is (5,5): down two, left one.\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (4,5): empty\n\n- (5,5): apple\n\nAgain, clear.\n\nThen, from (5,5), I could go to (0,8), but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could go to (3,1), but that's a bit far from (5,5).\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize eating (3,1) earlier.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I go for (3,1) first:\n\nFrom (3,3), move down twice to (3,1).\n\nPath:\n\n- (3,2): empty\n\n- (3,1): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake is at (3,3) and (3,1).\n\nThen, I can go for (3,6):\n\nFrom (3,1), up five times to (3,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that my tail is not in the way.\n\nWait, after eating (3,1), my snake has two segments: (3,3) and (3,1). If I move up to (3,2), then (3,3) moves to (3,2), but (3,2) is not yet occupied by my snake. Wait, no, the tail would be at (3,1), and the head at (3,2), then (3,3) would move to (3,2), but that's where the head is, which is invalid.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe going for (3,6) first is simpler.\n\nFrom (3,3), move up to (3,4), then up to (3,5), and up to (3,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), my snake is at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6).\n\nThen, I can move right to (4,6), then up to (4,7) to eat the next apple.\n\nFrom (4,7), I can move down to (4,6), then down to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), etc., to get to (5,5).\n\nThis seems more manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim to eat (3,1), then (5,5), then (4,7), but the path is less straightforward.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (3,6) first is a better strategy.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll move up to (3,4).\n\nNext turn, I'll move up to (3,5), then up to (3,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, I can proceed to (4,7), and so on.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this move is to move up to (3,4).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

In my previous move, I considered going for the closest apple, which was (3,1), but maybe I should recalculate based on the current position.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (3,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,8): |3-0| + |6-8| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- To (3,1): |3-3| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- To (5,5): |3-5| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (1,2): |3-1| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (7,1): |3-7| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5) with a distance of 3.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of other apples and potential paths that allow me to eat multiple apples in sequence without running into obstacles.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- (0,8) is top-left\n\n- (3,1) is bottom-middle\n\n- (5,5) is middle-middle\n\n- (1,2) is left-middle\n\n- (7,1) is bottom-right\n\nMy current position is (3,6), which is middle-left.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), which is nearby, I can move right to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (5,5).\n\n- (4,6): empty\n\n- (5,6): empty\n\n- (5,5): apple\n\nAfter eating (5,5), my snake will be at (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (5,5).\n\nThen, I can consider moving to (4,7) to eat the apple there, but (4,7) is occupied by the enemy snake's head. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (3,1). From (5,5), I would need to move down to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\nThat's a long path and increases the chance of making a mistake.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (3,1) directly.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move down to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then down to (3,1).\n\n- (3,5): empty\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): empty\n\n- (3,1): apple\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be at (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and (3,1).\n\nThen, I can move right to (4,1), then right to (5,1), then up to (5,2), and so on, but this seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (3,1), I can move up to (3,2), but my tail will be at (3,1), so it's okay.\n\nWait, no. When I move up from (3,1) to (3,2), my tail moves from (3,1) to (3,2), but (3,2) is already occupied by my body, which is invalid.\n\nThis is a problem. So, I need to make sure that after eating an apple, my snake doesn't immediately create a blockage.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different path.\n\nLet me think about going for (5,5) first, then (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,6), move right to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (5,5) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, move left to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then down to (3,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems longer but might be manageable.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), my snake will be at (5,5), (5,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and (3,1).\n\nThen, I can aim for (0,8). That's a long way up.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (1,2) next.\n\nFrom (3,1), move up to (3,2), then left to (2,2), then left to (1,2) to eat the apple.\n\n- (3,2): empty\n\n- (2,2): empty\n\n- (1,2): apple\n\nAfter eating (1,2), my snake will be at (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nThen, I can move to (1,3), then (1,4), and so on, but this seems too convoluted.\n\nI need a better strategy.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize movement.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (5,5) is close to (3,6)\n\n- (3,1) is below (3,6)\n\n- (1,2) is left and up from (3,6)\n\n- (7,1) is right and down from (3,6)\n\n- (0,8) is top-left\n\nPerhaps I should group apples that are nearby.\n\nFirst, eat (5,5), then (3,1), then (1,2), then (7,1), and finally (0,8).\n\nBut this seems inefficient due to the distance between (1,2) and (7,1).\n\nAlternatively, eat (5,5), then (7,1), then (3,1), then (1,2), then (0,8).\n\nWait, (7,1) is far from (5,5). Not ideal.\n\nMaybe eat (5,5), then (3,1), then (7,1), then (1,2), then (0,8).\n\nThis still involves a lot of back and forth.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the order based on the sequence that allows me to pick up the most apples without crossing my own path.\n\nLet me try planning a path:\n\nStart at (3,6)\n\n1. Move right to (4,6)\n\n2. Move right to (5,6)\n\n3. Move down to (5,5) to eat the apple\n\n4. Move left to (4,5)\n\n5. Move left to (3,5)\n\n6. Move down to (3,4)\n\n7. Move down to (3,3)\n\n8.
