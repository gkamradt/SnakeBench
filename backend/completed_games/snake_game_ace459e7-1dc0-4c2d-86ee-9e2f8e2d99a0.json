I don't want to risk running into the enemy snake, so I'll focus on the other apples.\n\nThe apple at (9, 4) is a bit far from me, but it's also on the opposite side of the board, so I'll consider that option later.\n\nThe apples at (0, 5) and (0, 2) are both on the bottom row, which is a bit of a risk since I'll be moving down and potentially running into the wall or the enemy snake. However, they're also relatively close to me, so I'll consider those options as well.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to head towards the apple at (3, 8), which is relatively close to me and not surrounded by the enemy snake. I'll try to move up and to the left to get closer to the apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

This will position me at (2,1), and then, if conditions remain favorable, I can continue to move right on the next turn to eat the apple position at (3, 1).\n- This move also ensures a safe distance from the enemy snake located at (6, 5), avoiding aggressive confrontations.\n- I also need to keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and avoid any situational traps or confinement between the enemy snake and the board's edges.\n\n**Next Move's Consideration:**\n- After reaching (2,1) by moving up, anticipate the next move to be to the RIGHT to consume the apple at (3, 1).\n- Always monitor the enemy snake's position and reassess its potential threat and the next closest apple's opportunity.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP."

The last move I made was to eat the apple at this position, and now I need to determine the next movement.\n- There are three possible apples to consider for the next target:\n  - (0, 2) which is to the left and down,\n  - (0, 5) which is further to the left and up,\n  - (9, 4) and (9, 3) which are far to the right.\n- The position of the enemy Snake #2 is at (4, 5), significantly further up the board and to the right from my current position, so it does not presently pose a direct threat or block paths to the closest apples.\n\n**Short-term Strategy:**\n- Heading to the apples at either (0,2) or (0,5) seems optimal as they're vertically aligned with each other, making them relatively easier to navigate after collecting one. This minimizes the need to cross the board again and avoids approaching near the enemy snake without necessity.\n\n**Next Moves Consideration:**\n- To move towards the apples at (0, 2) and (0, 5), I need to head LEFT and DOWN.\n- My immediate decision should consider setting up for a left move, as it allows further options to either continue left to (0, 2) or move upward later to (0, 5).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Moving LEFT now doesn't pose any risk of running into borders, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\n**Plan After Move:**\n- After moving LEFT, on the next move, I will decide based on my new position and any changes in the enemy's location whether to continue LEFT towards (0, 2), or adjust to head UP towards (0, 5) if that route looks clearer and strategically more beneficial.\n\n**Decided next move:** LEFT."
