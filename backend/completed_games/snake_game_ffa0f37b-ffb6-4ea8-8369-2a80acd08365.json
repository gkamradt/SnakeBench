Let's evaluate the possible moves:\n\n1. **RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n   - **Pros:** \n     - There's an apple at **(8, 5)**. Moving right will allow me to collect this apple, grow in length, and gain a point.\n     - This is the most direct path to increase my score.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - Moving towards the right edge brings me closer to the board's boundary, which might limit future movement options. However, the board size is sufficient, and there are still other apples available.\n\n2. **UP to (7, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** \n     - Opens up space for future movements upwards.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - Doesn't lead me directly to any immediate apple.\n     - Could potentially limit access to apples on the right side in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n   - **Pros:** \n     - Opens up space for future movements downwards.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - Similar to moving up, it doesn't lead to any immediate apple.\n     - Risk of getting trapped if future moves are limited.\n\n4. **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n   - **Pros:** \n     - Brings me closer to the center of the board.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - Risk of colliding with my own body, as indicated in the last move rationale.\n     - Moves away from the nearest apple.\n\n**Strategy:** Prioritize collecting the nearest apple at **(8, 5)** to maximize points efficiently. After collecting it, reassess the board to navigate towards other apples while ensuring safety from obstacles and the enemy snake.\n\n**Next move:** **RIGHT**"

Let's evaluate the possible moves:\n\n1. **UP to (6, 7):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves closer to the apple at **(3, 7)**.\n     - Opens up potential paths towards the top of the board for future apple collection.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Proximity to Snake #2 at **(0, 8)** might pose a risk if the enemy snake navigates downwards.\n     - Limited immediate apples in this direction, requiring additional moves to reach an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 5):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves towards the center-lower part of the board, providing access to apples at **(3, 2)** and **(3, 1)**.\n     - Potentially safer from enemy snake movements concentrated on the upper left.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Moves away from the cluster of apples on the left side, possibly delaying apple collection.\n     - Needs to navigate around the current snake body to avoid self-collision.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 6):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Continues towards the cluster of apples on the left side, targeting apples at **(3, 7)**, **(3, 2)**, and **(3, 1)**.\n     - Maintains proximity to open spaces for maneuvering.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No immediate apple at this position.\n     - Must ensure that further leftward movement doesn't lead towards the wall without safe paths.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves away from the enemy snake's vicinity, potentially reducing collision risks.\n     - Keeps options open to explore the right side if needed.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Limited apples in the rightward direction, making it less advantageous for scoring.\n     - Increases distance from the main cluster of apples on the left.\n\n**Strategy:** Prioritize movements that balance proximity to multiple apples with safety from enemy snakes and walls. Moving **UP** brings me closer to an apple and keeps me in a relatively open area, but I must remain cautious of the enemy snake's potential movements. Moving **LEFT** keeps me aligned with the apple cluster, providing multiple scoring opportunities while maintaining flexibility in navigation.\n\n**Next move:** **LEFT**"

            "rationale": "Okay, let me think this through for the current turn:\n\n* My current position is (1, 8) after moving UP diagonally last turn, reaching the apple at (3, 7).\n* The next closest apple is now at (0, 6), which is 2 steps diagonally down and left.\n* Snake #1 is still at (7, 6) with body at [(8, 6)], not an immediate threat but approaching my area.\n* To reach the apple at (0, 6), I should move diagonally DOWN and LEFT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move diagonally DOWN and LEFT to reach the apple at (0, 6). Keep an eye on Snake #1's movements, as it is getting closer to my area. If I reach (0, 6), re-evaluate the board and prioritize the next closest apple while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #1.\n\nMy next move: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching the apple at (0, 6), prioritize the next closest apple at (3, 2) while being cautious of Snake #1's position and movements."
