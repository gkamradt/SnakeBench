I will also avoid potential conflict with the other player for the time being.\n\nThere are risk concerns with this strategy because the other player could also start heading towards the same apples, so I will need to reconsider my strategy on my next move depending on their action. \n\nMy next move is: LEFT."

The closest ones are at (1, 5) and (2, 5), which are both to the left of my current position.\n\nHowever, I also need to be mindful of the enemy snake (#1) at (3, 9), which is right next to me. If I move left, I may run into it and die.\n\nMy strategy for this turn should be to move up towards the apple at (0, 9). This will put some distance between me and the enemy snake, and also get me closer to a valuable apple.\n\nNext turn, I will try to move down and to the left to collect the apples at (1, 5) and (2, 5), while still keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position.\n\nFor this turn, I will move UP."
