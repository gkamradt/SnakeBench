My next goal is to move towards one of the remaining apples.\n\nI see two apples nearby: (1, 0) and (1, 1). Both are relatively close, but I think I'll prioritize the one at (1, 0) since it's closer to the bottom of the board, which means I'll have more room to maneuver if needed.\n\nTo get to (1, 0), I need to move left and then down. But first, I'll move left to get closer to the x-coordinate of the apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (1, 0) by moving down.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
