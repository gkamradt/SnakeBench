Moving RIGHT to (9, 5) or LEFT to (9, 3) or DOWN to (8, 4) would all place the snake in empty spaces. However, moving RIGHT towards (9, 5) could potentially put the snake in a better position to reach the apple at (6, 1) in the future, as it would be closer to the column where the apple is located.\n\n### Next Move:\nRIGHT\n\nThis move will position the snake closer to the apple at (6, 1) and avoid the immediate danger of moving out of bounds.\n\nRIGHT"
