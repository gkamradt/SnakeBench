I need to get closer to it while avoiding Snake #2.\n\nSince I'm already at the same y-coordinate as the apple, my next move should be to move left to get closer to the apple. However, I need to be careful not to run into Snake #2, which is still at position (7, 3) with its body at [(7, 2), (6, 2)].\n\nMoving left now would put me at (1, 7), which is still a safe distance from Snake #2. From there, I can reassess the board and decide whether to move down or left again to get closer to the apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on Snake #2's movement and adjust my path accordingly.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

There's also an apple at (0, 1) and (6, 9), but they seem to be farther away. The enemy snake is at (2, 7) with its body at (2, 6), which is still far away from me.\n\nMy current strategy is to prioritize the apple at (3, 5) since it's relatively close to my current position and has the least obstacles. To get to this apple, I should move left and then up. I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and be prepared to change my strategy if it starts moving towards me.\n\nFor next turn, I should start moving towards the apple at (3, 5) while monitoring the enemy snake's position. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I may need to reconsider my strategy and prioritize avoiding it.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns is to move left until I reach the x-coordinate of 3, and then move up to reach the y-coordinate of 5.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT"
