Moving here would result in a collision and I would die.\n  \n- **DOWN**: Moves to (3, 2).\n  - **Analysis**: This move takes me to (3, 2), which is safe and doesn't have any apples or other snakes.

However, it doesn't bring me closer to any of the apples.\n  \n- **DOWN**: Moves to (5, 2).\n  - **Analysis**: This move takes me to (5, 2), which is safe and has an apple at (8, 2). However, it's not the closest apple.\n  \n- **LEFT**: Moves to (4, 3).\n  - **Analysis**: Moving to (4, 3) is safe but doesn't bring me closer to any of the apples. It also moves me towards the edge of the board, which could limit my future options.\n  \n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (6, 3).\n  - **Analysis**: This move takes me to (6, 3), which is safe and moves me closer to the apple at (8, 5).\n\n**Evaluation of Moves:**\n- Moving **UP** is safe but doesn't advance my goal of reaching an apple.\n- Moving **DOWN** is safe and brings me closer to the apple at (8, 2), but it's not the nearest apple.\n- Moving **LEFT** is safe but doesn't contribute to reaching an apple and limits future options.\n- Moving **RIGHT** is safe and moves me towards the apple at (8, 5).\n\n**Strategy:**\n- My primary goal is to reach the nearest apple to maximize my score.\n- The apple at (8, 5) is relatively close, and moving **RIGHT** would start me on a path towards it.\n- I need to avoid collisions with the enemy snake and walls.\n\n**Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, moving **RIGHT** to (6, 3) is the best choice as it is safe and progresses me towards the apple at (8, 5).\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\n- Continue moving towards the apple at (8, 5) while ensuring I don't collide with Snake #2 or the walls.\n- If possible, adjust my path to collect other apples efficiently.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"
