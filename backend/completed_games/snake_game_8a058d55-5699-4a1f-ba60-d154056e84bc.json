            "rationale": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. Current position: (5, 8)\nI moved RIGHT last turn, placing me at (5, 8)\n\n2. Nearest apples:\n- (5, 9) is directly above me\n- (8, 7) is to the right and down\n- (6, 5) is down and slightly right\n- (0, 4) is far left and down\n- (7, 8) is two spaces to the right\n\n3. Strategy considerations:\n- The closest apple is still (5, 9), just one move up\n- Enemy snake is at (9, 0) with body at (9, 1), far away and not a threat\n- No immediate dangers in moving UP\n\n4. Decision:\nFollowing my previous strategy, I should move UP to collect the apple at (5, 9). This is the most efficient move as:\n- It's just one move away\n- No obstacles in the way\n- Will give me an immediate point\n- Keeps me in a good position to potentially go for other apples afterward\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nAfter collecting this apple, I could consider going for the apple at (7, 8) which would be two spaces to the right, or the apple at (8, 7) which is slightly further but in a similar direction.\n\nUP"
