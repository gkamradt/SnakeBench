Since our last move was down, moving left this time will help us move diagonally towards the apple. Our strategy is to prioritize moving towards the apple while keeping an eye on Snake #1. For this turn, I suggest continuing with the diagonal movement towards the apple. Strategy: Diagonal movement towards the apple. Next move: LEFT (which corresponds to the 'A' key in a text-based game).\n\nYour next move: A"

The next nearest apple is right above me at (8, 5). Moving RIGHT will put me in position to consume the next apple and grow even more. This route also keeps a safe distance from Snake #2 and walls, reducing any immediate danger.\n\nNext turn, I should consider moving LEFT or DOWN after consuming the apple at (8, 5) to collect more apples.\n\nMy Next Move: RIGHT\n\n--End of your next move information.--"
