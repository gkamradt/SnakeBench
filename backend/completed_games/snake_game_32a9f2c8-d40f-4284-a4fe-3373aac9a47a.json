This will allow me to grow to a length of 3, putting me firmly in the lead.\n\nAfter eating this apple, the closest next target is the apple at (8, 6), which is 2 spaces to the right. I should be able to reach that easily on my next turn.\n\nBeyond that, I have a few options:\n1) Go for the apple at (8, 3) - requires moving down 3 spaces after (8, 6).\n2) Go for the apple at (9, 2) - requires moving down 4 spaces after (8, 6).\n3) Go for the apple at (6, 9) - requires moving left 2 spaces and up 3 spaces after (8, 6).\n\nThe (8, 3) and (9, 2) apples are closer and more directly accessible than the (6, 9) apple. I'll prioritize those for now.\n\nThe enemy snake is still all the way down at (1, 6) and doesn't pose any immediate danger. I can keep focusing on eating apples and growing.\n\nStrategy reminders for next turns:\n- Eat the (8, 6) apple next by moving right twice\n- Then decide between (8, 3) and (9, 2) apples based on enemy position \n- Start moving toward top border to limit enemy snake's options\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake, but focus on efficient apple pathing for now\n\nMy next move is: UP"
