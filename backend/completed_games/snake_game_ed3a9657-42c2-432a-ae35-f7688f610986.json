Go left to pick up the (1, 4) apple\n2. Be cautious of potential snake movement\n3. Look for safe paths to other apples after this move\n\nRationale for Move:\n- The apple at (1, 4) is the most immediate and safe opportunity\n- It allows me to grow and gain a point\n- Minimal risk of collision\n\nNext Move Decision: LEFT"
