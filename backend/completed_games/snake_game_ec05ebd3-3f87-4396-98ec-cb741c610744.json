It's a strategic position to evaluate a safer approach towards the far right apples or to change the plan if the enemy snake shifts location threateningly.\n- Moving right directly towards the enemy snake is risky without clear visibility and assurance of safety.\n\nStrategy for Future Moves:\n- Look for opportunities to safely advance towards the clustered apples at (7, 5) and (7, 7) while watching the enemy snake\u2019s movements.\n- Maintain flexibility in the pathing to avoid potentially hazardous collisions with the enemy snake.\n- Prioritize staying alive over risky aggressive moves for apple capture, as the enemy\u2019s position could potentially box me in or lead to conflict.\n\nNext move: UP."
