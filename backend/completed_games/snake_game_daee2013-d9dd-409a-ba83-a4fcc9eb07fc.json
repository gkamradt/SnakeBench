I need to avoid moving into their territory and to navigate away from (5, 1).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves from (4, 5):\n1. **DOWN to (4, 4)**: No apples, and keeps me safe but does not advance my position.\n2. **UP to (4, 6)**: This would take me back to a previous position, and again, no apples.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 5)**: I would move left but again no immediate gain.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 5)**: No apples here but moves me away from any confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategic Perspective:\n- The apple at **(6, 6)** is one possible target, but moving up toward that requires moving upward first rather than downward.\n- I want to avoid getting cornered near the enemy snake and must mind their proximity (can't move too close to (5,1)).\n\n### Rethinking Moves:\nSince moving back up or left does not center me towards any apples, I need to prioritize forward movement but should also evaluate which moves maintain close proximity to the apples while also being cautious of the enemy snake's position.\n\nTo stay safe and move toward the apple:\n- **UP to (4, 6)** moves me back.\n- **LEFT to (3, 5)** provides no new opportunities.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 5)** keeps me moving forward.\n\nMoving **RIGHT to (5, 5)** makes the most sense as it allows me to stay away from the enemy snake entrance and continues towards the right, where apples at (5, 2) and others might be reachable soon.\n\n### Final Decision:\nI'll move **RIGHT to (5, 5)**. \n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter this move, I should focus on evaluating the position of the apples above (6,6) and ensure the enemy snake does not approach from below as I advance. Proper navigation will be keen to avoid running forward into the enemy snake while still collecting apples."
