I'd like to get closer to the top-right corner, as it seems to be a safer area with fewer potential threats from other snakes.\n\nI'd like to move up to (4, 6) to get closer to the top-right corner and potentially get closer to an apple. This will also give me a better view of the board and allow me to react to any potential threats.\n\nNext move: UP."
