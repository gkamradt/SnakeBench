There are several apples placed at different locations, and an enemy snake (ID 2) is positioned at (2, 5).\n\nMy initial strategy is to try to collect as many apples as possible to increase my score while avoiding collisions with the walls, the enemy snake, or my own body.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3, 6), which is one step up from my current position. This seems like a good next move to gain a point.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is positioned to the left of me, so moving up would also put some distance between us, reducing the risk of a collision.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: UP"

Moving down, right, or left would put us in danger of running into Snake #1.\n- **Closest Apples**: The closest apples are at (4, 5) and (3, 6). Moving up to (1, 5) is safe but doesn't get us closer to an apple. Moving right to (2, 6) would put us closer to the apple at (3, 6).\n- **Strategy**: Given the proximity of Snake #1, the safest move is to move right to (2, 6) to get closer to an apple.\n\n### Decision:\nMove right to (2, 6).\n\nEnd move: RIGHT"
