It keeps options open and allows flexibility.\n\n### Analyzing the Moves\n- **UP (0, 8)**: It creates distance and might be safe but isn't productive towards my goal of collecting apples.\n- **DOWN (0, 6)**: It's a step backwards.\n- **LEFT (-1, 7)**: Invalid move.\n- **RIGHT (1, 7)**: This is appealing as it opens up more possibilities going forward on the board. \n\n### Strategic Goals\n1. **Get closer to an accessible apple**: The closest apple appears to be in rows 2 with coordinates (4, 2) or (2, 2), which are far but achievable with multiple moves.\n2. **Maintain distance from snake #2** at (3, 6) to avoid confrontation, while also staying strategic in apple acquisition.\n\nSince moving UP does not help, going DOWN is backtracking, and LEFT is invalid, the only logical movement that keeps me flexible and evolving is to move RIGHT to (1, 7).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**."

This way, I can reposition myself away from the enemy while maintaining options to either collect apples or move downward towards them in future turns.\n\n**Next Move: UP.**"

The apples I want to target are at (2, 2) and (4, 2). \n\n### Potential Moves\n1. **UP (to (2, 9))**: This is off the board since the maximum Y-coordinate is 9.

This is backward and doesn't help my goal.\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 8))**: This keeps me on the same row and doesn\u2019t lead towards the apples. However, it also keeps me away from the enemy snake and is safe.\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 8))**: This would move me directly into the position of the enemy snake, which is dangerous.\n\n### Strategic Goals for This Turn\n- **Safety First**: I want to avoid confrontation with enemy snakes and avoid any backwards movement.\n- **Apple Collection**: While none of the immediate moves allow me to collect apples, I need to position myself for future turns to get closer to them.\n- **Avoid Enemy Confrontation**: Right is not an option due to the enemy being there, and I\u2019m also not keen on going back to where I was.\n\n### Conclusion\nConsidering all options:\n- Moving UP is out.\n- Moving DOWN is backward and not optimal.\n- LEFT keeps me safe and ready to make a decision next turn as it avoids confrontation with the enemy.\n- RIGHT is not an option due to its danger.\n\nIn conclusion, the safest move that still maintains forward progress involves moving **LEFT to (1, 8)**. This positions me in a non-confrontational stance and keeps future options open.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT.**"
