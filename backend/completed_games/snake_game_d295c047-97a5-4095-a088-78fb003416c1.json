I also need to be cautious of the enemy snake #2, which is at (5, 7).\n\nI'm considering moving right to get closer to the top-right corner, but I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. I could also try to move up to get closer to the top-right corner, but that might put me in a more vulnerable position.\n\nI think my best bet is to move right, as it will allow me to get closer to the top-right corner and potentially grab one of the apples. I'll also keep an eye on the enemy snake and be prepared to adjust my strategy if necessary.\n\nMy next move is: RIGHT."

This move brings me closer to the apple at (7, 5) while also keeping a safe distance from enemy snake #1. If I don't reach the apple this turn, I will continue moving up to explore the board and find more apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I reach the apple at (7, 5), I'll move down to secure it and gain a point. If not, I'll continue moving up to explore the board and find more apples.\n\nNext move: UP."
