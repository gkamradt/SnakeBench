            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nFirst, the board is set up with the snake ID 1 at position (1,4). The board has some apples at positions (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). My snake is currently on (1,4), which means it's moving towards the right and down. \n\nThe board state is given, but I think it's better to visualize it. The board is divided into rows, each row being a horizontal line. The first row is row 0, which is the bottom row, and the last row is row 9, the top row. So, the coordinates increase to the right and up.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that there are apples in the middle of the board. The snake is at (1,4), so it's in the second column and fifth row. The apples are at (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). \n\nNow, the rules are important. Rule 1 says if I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. But I have to be careful because if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to avoid that.\n\nMy current position is (1,4). Let me see where the apples are relative to me. The apples are at (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). So, from (1,4), I can move right to (1,5), which is empty, or down to (2,4), which is also empty. But I need to check if moving into any of these positions would cause me to die.\n\nIf I move right to (1,5), I need to check the adjacent cells. The cell to the left is (1,4), which is my current position, so that's fine. The cell to the right is (1,6), which is empty. The cell below is (2,4), which is empty. So, moving right is possible.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I need to check the cells around it. The cell above is (1,4), which is me, so that's okay. The cell below is (3,4), which is empty. The cell to the left is (2,3), which is empty. So, moving down is also possible.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the apples. If I move into an apple, I gain a point. So, I need to see if moving into any of the apples would be safe.\n\nLooking at the apples, (5,5) is to the right and down from (1,4). (3,7) is to the right and down as well. (1,9) is directly below (1,8), which is empty. (0,1) is to the left and down. (8,6) is to the right and down.\n\nSo, moving into any of these apples would give me a point, but I have to make sure I don't die. Let's check each possible move.\n\nMoving right to (1,5): Is this cell occupied? The board shows row 5, column 5 as empty. So, no problem. I can move there.\n\nMoving down to (2,4): Row 2, column 4 is empty. So, I can move there as well.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving into any of these apples would cause me to die. For example, if I move into (5,5), which is an apple, I gain a point. But I need to make sure that moving into that cell doesn't cause me to die. Since (5,5) is within the board, I can move there without dying.\n\nSimilarly, moving into (3,7) would give me a point, but I need to check if that's possible. From (1,4), moving down to (2,4) and then right to (2,5), but (3,7) is further down and to the right. So, I need to see if there's a path to (3,7) without dying.\n\nWait, but the snake is only moving one cell at a time, right? So, if I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), and so on, I can reach (3,7) without dying. So, moving into (3,7) is possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into any of the apples, I gain a point. So, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I need to make sure that I can reach it without dying.\n\nWait, but the snake is moving in a straight line, so if I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), and so on, I can reach (3,7) without dying. So, moving into (3,7) is possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into (5,5), I gain a point, but I also need to check if that's possible without dying. Since (5,5) is within the board, I can move there.\n\nBut I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (1,9) would give me a point, but I need to check if that's possible. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7), then down to (4,7), then right to (4,8), then down to (5,8), then right to (5,9), then down to (6,9), then right to (6,8), then down to (7,8), then right to (7,9), then down to (8,9), then right to (8,8), then down to (9,8), then right to (9,9), then down to (10,9) which is outside the board. Wait, that's a problem because I'm moving down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving into (1,9) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I can't move into (1,9).\n\nSimilarly, moving into (0,1) would require me to move left from (1,4) to (0,4), then down to (1,4), which is me, then right to (1,5), and so on. But I can't move left from (1,4) to (0,4) because that's allowed, but I can't move left from (0,4) to (-1,4), which is outside the board. So, moving into (0,1) is possible.\n\nWait, but I'm at (1,4). If I move left to (0,4), that's allowed. Then, from (0,4), I can move down to (1,4), which is me, then right to (1,5), and so on. So, moving into (0,1) is possible.\n\nBut I need to check if moving into (0,1) would cause me to die. Since (0,1) is within the board, I can move there without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (0,1) is possible, but I need to see if it's better than moving into (3,7) or (5,5).\n\nBut wait, moving into (3,7) would give me a point, but I also need to make sure that I can reach it without dying. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I need to make sure I can reach it without dying. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7), then down to (4,7), then right to (4,8), then down to (5,8), then right to (5,9), then down to (6,9), then right to (6,8), then down to (7,8), then right to (7,9), then down to (8,9), then right to (8,8), then down to (9,8), then right to (9,9), then down to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving into (5,5) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board.\n\nSo, the possible moves are right to (1,5) and down to (2,4). But moving down to (2,4) might be better because it's closer to the center of the board, which is where the apples are.\n\nBut wait, moving down to (2,4) would take me to (2,4), which is empty. So, that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5) would take me to (1,5), which is also empty.\n\nBut I need to consider the apples. If I move into (3,7), I gain a point, but I also need to make sure I can reach it without dying.\n\nWait, but moving into (3,7) would require me to move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into (5,5), I gain a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better because it gives me a point and I can reach it without dying.\n\nAlternatively, moving into (0,1) gives me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better.\n\nBut wait, I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (1,9) would give me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is the best option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the direction. If I move right to (1,5), I can then move down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a path to (3,7).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (2,4), then right to (2,5), then down to (3,5), then right to (3,6), then down to (4,6), then right to (4,7), then down to (5,7), then right to (5,8), then down to (6,8), then right to (6,9), then down to (7,9), then right to (7,8), then down to (8,8), then right to (8,9), then down to (9,9), then right to (9,8), then down to (10,8), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (2,4) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board.\n\nSo, the only possible moves are right to (1,5) and down to (2,4). But moving down to (2,4) would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board, so I can't do that.\n\nTherefore, the only possible move is right to (1,5).\n\nWait, but I also need to consider the other apples. For example, moving into (3,7) is possible, but I can reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving right to (1,5) is possible, but I can also move right to (1,5) and then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a longer path, but I can reach (3,7) without dying.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5) and then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nBut I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better.\n\nBut I also need to consider the direction. If I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a path to (3,7).\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7).

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nFirst, the board is set up with the snake ID 1 at position (1,4). The board has some apples at positions (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). My snake is currently on (1,4), which means it's moving towards the right and down. \n\nThe board state is given, but I think it's better to visualize it. The board is divided into rows, each row being a horizontal line. The first row is row 0, which is the bottom row, and the last row is row 9, the top row. So, the coordinates increase to the right and up.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that there are apples in the middle of the board. The snake is at (1,4), so it's in the second column and fifth row. The apples are at (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). \n\nNow, the rules are important. Rule 1 says if I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. But I have to be careful because if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to avoid that.\n\nMy current position is (1,4). Let me see where the apples are relative to me. The apples are at (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). So, from (1,4), I can move right to (1,5), which is empty, or down to (2,4), which is also empty. But I need to check if moving into any of these positions would cause me to die.\n\nIf I move right to (1,5), I need to check the adjacent cells. The cell to the left is (1,4), which is my current position, so that's fine. The cell to the right is (1,6), which is empty. The cell below is (2,4), which is empty. So, moving right is possible.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I need to check the cells around it. The cell above is (1,4), which is me, so that's okay. The cell below is (3,4), which is empty. The cell to the left is (2,3), which is empty. So, moving down is also possible.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the apples. If I move into an apple, I gain a point. So, I need to see if moving into any of the apples would be safe.\n\nLooking at the apples, (5,5) is to the right and down from (1,4). (3,7) is to the right and down as well. (1,9) is directly below (1,8), which is empty. (0,1) is to the left and down. (8,6) is to the right and down.\n\nSo, moving into any of these apples would give me a point, but I have to make sure I don't die. Let's check each possible move.\n\nMoving right to (1,5): Is this cell occupied? The board shows row 5, column 5 as empty. So, no problem. I can move there.\n\nMoving down to (2,4): Row 2, column 4 is empty. So, I can move there as well.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving into any of these apples would cause me to die. For example, if I move into (5,5), which is an apple, I gain a point. But I need to make sure that moving into that cell doesn't cause me to die. Since (5,5) is within the board, I can move there without dying.\n\nSimilarly, moving into (3,7) would give me a point, but I need to check if that's possible. From (1,4), moving down to (2,4) and then right to (2,5), but (3,7) is further down and to the right. So, I need to see if there's a path to (3,7) without dying.\n\nWait, but the snake is only moving one cell at a time, right? So, if I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), and so on, I can reach (3,7) without dying. So, moving into (3,7) is possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into any of the apples, I gain a point. So, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I need to make sure that I can reach it without dying.\n\nWait, but the snake is moving in a straight line, so if I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), and so on, I can reach (3,7) without dying. So, moving into (3,7) is possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into (5,5), I gain a point, but I also need to check if that's possible without dying. Since (5,5) is within the board, I can move there.\n\nBut I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (1,9) would give me a point, but I need to check if that's possible. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7), then down to (4,7), then right to (4,8), then down to (5,8), then right to (5,9), then down to (6,9), then right to (6,8), then down to (7,8), then right to (7,9), then down to (8,9), then right to (8,8), then down to (9,8), then right to (9,9), then down to (10,9) which is outside the board. Wait, that's a problem because I'm moving down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving into (1,9) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I can't move into (1,9).\n\nSimilarly, moving into (0,1) would require me to move left from (1,4) to (0,4), then down to (1,4), which is me, then right to (1,5), and so on. But I can't move left from (1,4) to (0,4) because that's allowed, but I can't move left from (0,4) to (-1,4), which is outside the board. So, moving into (0,1) is possible.\n\nWait, but I'm at (1,4). If I move left to (0,4), that's allowed. Then, from (0,4), I can move down to (1,4), which is me, then right to (1,5), and so on. So, moving into (0,1) is possible.\n\nBut I need to check if moving into (0,1) would cause me to die. Since (0,1) is within the board, I can move there without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (0,1) is possible, but I need to see if it's better than moving into (3,7) or (5,5).\n\nBut wait, moving into (3,7) would give me a point, but I also need to make sure that I can reach it without dying. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I need to make sure I can reach it without dying. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7), then down to (4,7), then right to (4,8), then down to (5,8), then right to (5,9), then down to (6,9), then right to (6,8), then down to (7,8), then right to (7,9), then down to (8,9), then right to (8,8), then down to (9,8), then right to (9,9), then down to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving into (5,5) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board.\n\nSo, the possible moves are right to (1,5) and down to (2,4). But moving down to (2,4) might be better because it's closer to the center of the board, which is where the apples are.\n\nBut wait, moving down to (2,4) would take me to (2,4), which is empty. So, that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5) would take me to (1,5), which is also empty.\n\nBut I need to consider the apples. If I move into (3,7), I gain a point, but I also need to make sure I can reach it without dying.\n\nWait, but moving into (3,7) would require me to move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into (5,5), I gain a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better because it gives me a point and I can reach it without dying.\n\nAlternatively, moving into (0,1) gives me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better.\n\nBut wait, I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (1,9) would give me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is the best option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the direction. If I move right to (1,5), I can then move down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a path to (3,7).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (2,4), then right to (2,5), then down to (3,5), then right to (3,6), then down to (4,6), then right to (4,7), then down to (5,7), then right to (5,8), then down to (6,8), then right to (6,9), then down to (7,9), then right to (7,8), then down to (8,8), then right to (8,9), then down to (9,9), then right to (9,8), then down to (10,8), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (2,4) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board.\n\nSo, the only possible moves are right to (1,5) and down to (2,4). But moving down to (2,4) would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board, so I can't do that.\n\nTherefore, the only possible move is right to (1,5).\n\nWait, but I also need to consider the other apples. For example, moving into (3,7) is possible, but I can reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving right to (1,5) is possible, but I can also move right to (1,5) and then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a longer path, but I can reach (3,7) without dying.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5) and then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nBut I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better.\n\nBut I also need to consider the direction. If I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a path to (3,7).\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7).

Move towards the apple at (0,1) which is on the same Y position\n2. Move left till we reach the position (0, 1).\n3. Once we get the apple we can evaluate again\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nFirst, the board is set up with the snake ID 1 at position (1,4). The board has some apples at positions (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). My snake is currently on (1,4), which means it's moving towards the right and down. \n\nThe board state is given, but I think it's better to visualize it. The board is divided into rows, each row being a horizontal line. The first row is row 0, which is the bottom row, and the last row is row 9, the top row. So, the coordinates increase to the right and up.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that there are apples in the middle of the board. The snake is at (1,4), so it's in the second column and fifth row. The apples are at (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). \n\nNow, the rules are important. Rule 1 says if I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. But I have to be careful because if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to avoid that.\n\nMy current position is (1,4). Let me see where the apples are relative to me. The apples are at (5,5), (3,7), (1,9), (0,1), and (8,6). So, from (1,4), I can move right to (1,5), which is empty, or down to (2,4), which is also empty. But I need to check if moving into any of these positions would cause me to die.\n\nIf I move right to (1,5), I need to check the adjacent cells. The cell to the left is (1,4), which is my current position, so that's fine. The cell to the right is (1,6), which is empty. The cell below is (2,4), which is empty. So, moving right is possible.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I need to check the cells around it. The cell above is (1,4), which is me, so that's okay. The cell below is (3,4), which is empty. The cell to the left is (2,3), which is empty. So, moving down is also possible.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the apples. If I move into an apple, I gain a point. So, I need to see if moving into any of the apples would be safe.\n\nLooking at the apples, (5,5) is to the right and down from (1,4). (3,7) is to the right and down as well. (1,9) is directly below (1,8), which is empty. (0,1) is to the left and down. (8,6) is to the right and down.\n\nSo, moving into any of these apples would give me a point, but I have to make sure I don't die. Let's check each possible move.\n\nMoving right to (1,5): Is this cell occupied? The board shows row 5, column 5 as empty. So, no problem. I can move there.\n\nMoving down to (2,4): Row 2, column 4 is empty. So, I can move there as well.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving into any of these apples would cause me to die. For example, if I move into (5,5), which is an apple, I gain a point. But I need to make sure that moving into that cell doesn't cause me to die. Since (5,5) is within the board, I can move there without dying.\n\nSimilarly, moving into (3,7) would give me a point, but I need to check if that's possible. From (1,4), moving down to (2,4) and then right to (2,5), but (3,7) is further down and to the right. So, I need to see if there's a path to (3,7) without dying.\n\nWait, but the snake is only moving one cell at a time, right? So, if I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), and so on, I can reach (3,7) without dying. So, moving into (3,7) is possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into any of the apples, I gain a point. So, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I need to make sure that I can reach it without dying.\n\nWait, but the snake is moving in a straight line, so if I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), and so on, I can reach (3,7) without dying. So, moving into (3,7) is possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into (5,5), I gain a point, but I also need to check if that's possible without dying. Since (5,5) is within the board, I can move there.\n\nBut I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (1,9) would give me a point, but I need to check if that's possible. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7), then down to (4,7), then right to (4,8), then down to (5,8), then right to (5,9), then down to (6,9), then right to (6,8), then down to (7,8), then right to (7,9), then down to (8,9), then right to (8,8), then down to (9,8), then right to (9,9), then down to (10,9) which is outside the board. Wait, that's a problem because I'm moving down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving into (1,9) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I can't move into (1,9).\n\nSimilarly, moving into (0,1) would require me to move left from (1,4) to (0,4), then down to (1,4), which is me, then right to (1,5), and so on. But I can't move left from (1,4) to (0,4) because that's allowed, but I can't move left from (0,4) to (-1,4), which is outside the board. So, moving into (0,1) is possible.\n\nWait, but I'm at (1,4). If I move left to (0,4), that's allowed. Then, from (0,4), I can move down to (1,4), which is me, then right to (1,5), and so on. So, moving into (0,1) is possible.\n\nBut I need to check if moving into (0,1) would cause me to die. Since (0,1) is within the board, I can move there without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (0,1) is possible, but I need to see if it's better than moving into (3,7) or (5,5).\n\nBut wait, moving into (3,7) would give me a point, but I also need to make sure that I can reach it without dying. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I need to make sure I can reach it without dying. From (1,4), moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7), then down to (4,7), then right to (4,8), then down to (5,8), then right to (5,9), then down to (6,9), then right to (6,8), then down to (7,8), then right to (7,9), then down to (8,9), then right to (8,8), then down to (9,8), then right to (9,9), then down to (10,9), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving into (5,5) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board.\n\nSo, the possible moves are right to (1,5) and down to (2,4). But moving down to (2,4) might be better because it's closer to the center of the board, which is where the apples are.\n\nBut wait, moving down to (2,4) would take me to (2,4), which is empty. So, that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5) would take me to (1,5), which is also empty.\n\nBut I need to consider the apples. If I move into (3,7), I gain a point, but I also need to make sure I can reach it without dying.\n\nWait, but moving into (3,7) would require me to move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nBut I also need to consider the apples. If I move into (5,5), I gain a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better because it gives me a point and I can reach it without dying.\n\nAlternatively, moving into (0,1) gives me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better.\n\nBut wait, I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (1,9) would give me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is the best option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the direction. If I move right to (1,5), I can then move down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a path to (3,7).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (2,4), then right to (2,5), then down to (3,5), then right to (3,6), then down to (4,6), then right to (4,7), then down to (5,7), then right to (5,8), then down to (6,8), then right to (6,9), then down to (7,9), then right to (7,8), then down to (8,8), then right to (8,9), then down to (9,9), then right to (9,8), then down to (10,8), which is outside the board. So, I would die.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (2,4) is not possible because it would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board.\n\nSo, the only possible moves are right to (1,5) and down to (2,4). But moving down to (2,4) would require me to move down from (9,9) to (10,9), which is outside the board, so I can't do that.\n\nTherefore, the only possible move is right to (1,5).\n\nWait, but I also need to consider the other apples. For example, moving into (3,7) is possible, but I can reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving right to (1,5) is possible, but I can also move right to (1,5) and then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a longer path, but I can reach (3,7) without dying.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5) and then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's possible.\n\nBut I also need to think about the other apples. For example, moving into (5,5) would give me a point, but I can't reach it without dying.\n\nSo, moving into (3,7) is better.\n\nBut I also need to consider the direction. If I move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7). So, that's a path to (3,7).\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,5), then down to (2,5), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then right to (3,7).

Moving down is a direct and safe route to acquiring this apple.\n2. **Future Strategy**: Once you acquire the apple at (0, 1), re-evaluate the board. The next closest apples are at (1, 9) and (5, 5). After acquiring the apple at (0, 1), I will formulate a path to get the apple at (5, 5) which might also increase my path to reach the next apple.\n\n### Next Move:\nGiven the situation, the next move should be to acquire the apple at (0, 1).\n\n**Decision**: DOWN"
