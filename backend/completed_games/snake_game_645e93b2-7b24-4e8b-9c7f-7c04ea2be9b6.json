I should prioritize moving towards these apples.\n\nHowever, I also need to be cautious of Snake #2, which is at position (9, 2) with its body at an empty space. If I get too close to it, I might get caught in its body.\n\nConsidering my current position and the available apples, my next move should be to move towards the apple at (3, 3). This is a relatively safe move, and I can try to get closer to it without putting myself in danger.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to move towards the apple at (3, 3) and see if I can get closer to it without getting caught by Snake #2.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "1. Since the last move was DOWN and we collected an apple, the snake's head is now at (9, 4), and we are planning to move DOWN again to collect the apple at (9, 3).\n\n2. After collecting the apple at (9, 3), we need to decide our next move. The remaining apples are at (3, 3), (4, 2), (2, 5), and (3, 6). We should aim for the apple at (2, 5) next because it is relatively isolated and collecting it would position us well to reach the other apples without backtracking.\n\n3. To reach the apple at (2, 5), we should move LEFT after collecting the apple at (9, 3). This will start our trajectory towards the left side of the board where the remaining apples are clustered.\n\n4. We need to be cautious of the enemy snake #1, which is currently at (9, 7). However, it is moving away from us, so we have a safe path to collect the next apple without immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\n5. We should continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements and be prepared to adjust our strategy if it starts to move towards our planned path.\n\n6. It's important to avoid moving upwards towards the top of the board unnecessarily, as this could limit our options for escape if the enemy snake changes direction.\n\n7. After moving LEFT from (9, 3), our next move will likely be UP towards (2, 5), but we will reassess the situation after the LEFT move to ensure it's still the safest and most efficient path.\n\nNote to self for the next turn: After moving LEFT from (9, 3), evaluate the enemy snake's position again. If it's safe, continue moving UP towards (2, 5). If the enemy snake poses a threat, consider an alternative route to the apple at (3, 3) or (4, 2), which could be safer depending on the enemy snake's trajectory. Always leave room to maneuver and avoid getting cornered.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
