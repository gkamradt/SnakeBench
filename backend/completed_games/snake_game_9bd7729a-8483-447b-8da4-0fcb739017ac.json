After consuming the apple at (6, 3), reassess the board for the optimal next move, considering the positions of all apples and the enemy snake.\n\n**Decision for This Turn**: Given the immediate goal of consuming an apple and the proximity of the apple at (6, 3), the best move is to head directly towards it.\n\n**Next Move**: DOWN"
