            "rationale": "Alright, I\u2019m currently positioned at (3, 7) and I\u2019ve decided to move DOWN to (3, 6). Let\u2019s analyze this move and the subsequent options I\u2019ll have.\n\n### Current Board Position:\n- My current position is (3, 6).\n- Apples available: (3, 4), (1, 5), (8, 2), (0, 3), and (4, 0).\n- Enemy Snake #2 is at (6, 9) and their movement isn\u2019t a direct threat to me at (3, 6).\n\n### Potential Moves from (3, 6):\n1. **UP (to 3, 7)**: This goes back to where I was and is not allowed.\n2. **DOWN (to 3, 5)**: This position is unoccupied and leads me further towards the apple at (3, 4).\n3. **LEFT (to 2, 6)**: This position is also empty but moves me away from the apple at (3, 4).\n4. **RIGHT (to 4, 6)**: This position is also empty but does not direct me toward apples either.\n\n### Move Analysis:\n- **Moving DOWN (to 3, 5)**:\n  - Continuing down gets me one step closer to the apple directly below at (3, 4).\n  \n- **Moving LEFT (to 2, 6)** or **RIGHT (to 4, 6)**:\n  - Both of these options do not advance my proximity towards the nearest apple, so they aren't ideal.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\nMy primary goal at this point is to collect apples, especially (3, 4) which is directly reachable if I move down. After moving down, if I reach (3, 4), I will also grow, giving me more space to maneuver and more points to secure. While I monitor enemy movements, I know my next move is crucial for both survival and progression.\n\nDecided next move: **DOWN**."
