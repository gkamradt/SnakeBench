Not safe.\n\nThe immediate best move is to go LEFT and grab the apple at (5, 5).\n\nNext turn strategy: After eating the apple at (5,5), re-evaluate the positions of the other apples, especially (3,3) and (3,2). Also, carefully observe the movement of snake #2 to avoid getting blocked or trapped.\n\nFinal Answer:\nLEFT"
