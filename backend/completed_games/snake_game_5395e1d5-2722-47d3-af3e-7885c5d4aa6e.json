To reach (1, 8), I would need to go LEFT 1 step, then UP 5 steps.\n6. The enemy snake at (0, 4) is still relatively far away, but I should continue to be mindful of its potential movement.\n7. The apple at (2, 1) is closer, but going for it directly would put me closer to the enemy snake's current position.\n8. The apple at (1, 8) is equidistant, and going for it would take me further away from the enemy snake's current position.\n\nBased on the current state, I think the best move is to go LEFT towards (1, 8). This will put more distance between me and the enemy snake for now, while still allowing me to work towards grabbing an apple in the next turn.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving left, I should re-evaluate the positions of the enemy snake and the remaining apples. If the enemy snake moves closer to my area, I may need to prioritize safety and maneuver to avoid it.
