Let me try to visualize the board based on the information given.\n\nLooking at the current state, apples are located at (7,7), (3,3), (6,1), (1,6), and (6,7). My snake is at (5,1), and the enemy snake, snake #2, is at (5,5) with an empty body, meaning it's probably just the head.\n\nMy position is (5,1), which is near the bottom of the board, a bit to the right. The apples near me are at (6,1), which is one unit to the right, and at (3,3), which is to the left and up. Also, there's (1,6), which is way to the left and up.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to move next. My snake can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But I need to consider the rules: I can't move into a wall, another snake, or myself. Since I don't have a body yet, the only immediate danger is snake #2 at (5,5) or the walls.\n\nLet me check the possible directions:\n\n1. UP: That would take me to (5,2). Is that safe? Let me see if there's an apple there. No, the closest apple is at (6,1), which is to the right, not up. So moving up from (5,1) to (5,2) isn't towards an apple, but it's a valid move. But is there any obstacle there? I don't think so because the other snakes and apples are elsewhere.\n\n2. DOWN: From (5,1), moving down would take me to (5,0), which is the bottom row. That's a valid move, but there's no apple there. But maybe moving down isn't useful because I want to go towards an apple.\n\n3. LEFT: From (5,1), moving left would take me to (4,1). Is there anything important there? The apples at (3,3) and (6,1) are nearby. (4,1) is just another position, but I'm not moving towards an apple directly.\n\n4. RIGHT: Moving right from (5,1) takes me to (6,1), which is an apple! That's great because I can gain a point and grow. Plus, growing might help me in the future when dealing with other snakes.\n\nWait, but snake #2 is at (5,5). If I move right to (6,1), I'll be moving away from snake #2. Is there a risk of collision? Well, snake #2 is at (5,5), so it's above me, so moving right to (6,1) shouldn't interfere with snake #2 unless it moves down. But since I'm the one making the first move, I should be fine.\n\nAlso, the apple at (6,1) is right next to me. So moving right seems like the best option because I'll eat the apple, gain a point, and grow.\n\nWait a second, is there any other consideration? Like, after eating the apple, where should I go next? Well, one step at a time. First, I need to get the apple at (6,1), so moving RIGHT is the correct move now.\n\nAlternatively, moving up towards (5,2) would take me away from the apple at (6,1), which is right there. So I don't think that's a good idea unless I'm avoiding something, but I don't see anything in my way.\n\nSo the best move is to go RIGHT to (6,1) and eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext move: RIGHT.

            "rationale": "Alright, let me think through the next move step by step based on the updated information.\n\nSo, after the last move, I moved RIGHT from (5,1) to (6,1) and ate the apple there. My current position is (6,1), and I've gained a point. Now, I need to decide my next direction.\n\nLooking at the board now, the apples remaining are at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), and (6,7). My position is (6,1), so I'm at the bottom middle part of the board.\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (5,5). I need to be cautious not to collide with it. From (6,1), moving UP would take me to (6,2). Is that safe? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are:\n\n- (7,7) which is quite far up and to the right.\n- (6,7) which is directly above me, 6 units up from (6,1).\n- (3,3) which is to the left and up.\n- (1,6) which is far left and up.\n\nSince I'm at (6,1), moving UP towards (6,2) starts me on the path towards (6,7). That seems like a good idea because it's the closest apple that's several units away but in a straight line.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (6,1) would take me to (7,1), which is empty. Moving LEFT back to (5,1) would take me to where I was before, but there's nothing there. Moving DOWN from (6,1) would take me to (6,0), which is the bottom edge, but that doesn't get me closer to any apples.\n\nSo, moving UP to (6,2) is the best option. It gets me one step closer to (6,7). Plus, moving upwards doesn't put me directly in the path of snake #2 at (5,5) unless it moves down, but I can cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nAnother consideration: since I ate an apple, my snake now has a body. So, I need to make sure that my next moves don't cause me to run into myself. But since I only have the head at (6,1) before moving, and the next move is to (6,2), there's no body to collide with yet. Once I start moving, I'll have to be careful about where I go to avoid running into my own body.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (6,2), and then continue moving up towards (6,7), trying to reach that apple before enemy snakes or I run into any obstacles.\n\nI should also keep an eye on where snake #2 is moving, but since I don't have information on its last move direction, I can't predict its movement. So, focusing on the apple is better.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,7), my next targets would be (7,7) or (3,3), depending on which is more accessible.\n\nFor now, the best move is to go UP to (6,2).\n\nUP\n\n---\n\nNext move: UP to (6,2). Strategy: Proceed upwards towards (6,7) to collect the next apple while being cautious of the enemy snake's position."

My position is (6,1), so I'm at the bottom middle part of the board.\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (5,5). I need to be cautious not to collide with it. From (6,1), moving UP would take me to (6,2). Is that safe? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are:\n\n- (7,7) which is quite far up and to the right.\n- (6,7) which is directly above me, 6 units up from (6,1).\n- (3,3) which is to the left and up.\n- (1,6) which is far left and up.\n\nSince I'm at (6,1), moving UP towards (6,2) starts me on the path towards (6,7). That seems like a good idea because it's the closest apple that's several units away but in a straight line.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (6,1) would take me to (7,1), which is empty. Moving LEFT back to (5,1) would take me to where I was before, but there's nothing there. Moving DOWN from (6,1) would take me to (6,0), which is the bottom edge, but that doesn't get me closer to any apples.\n\nSo, moving UP to (6,2) is the best option. It gets me one step closer to (6,7). Plus, moving upwards doesn't put me directly in the path of snake #2 at (5,5) unless it moves down, but I can cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nAnother consideration: since I ate an apple, my snake now has a body. So, I need to make sure that my next moves don't cause me to run into myself. But since I only have the head at (6,1) before moving, and the next move is to (6,2), there's no body to collide with yet. Once I start moving, I'll have to be careful about where I go to avoid running into my own body.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (6,2), and then continue moving up towards (6,7), trying to reach that apple before enemy snakes or I run into any obstacles.\n\nI should also keep an eye on where snake #2 is moving, but since I don't have information on its last move direction, I can't predict its movement. So, focusing on the apple is better.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,7), my next targets would be (7,7) or (3,3), depending on which is more accessible.\n\nFor now, the best move is to go UP to (6,2).\n\nUP\n\n---\n\nNext move: UP to (6,2).

The last move was UP to get here, and I need to decide the next direction.\n\nFirst, let me check the board. The apples are at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). Wait, no, according to the initial state, apples are at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). But in the last move, I moved to (6,2), which I think might have been an apple because the last move info mentioned eating one. So maybe the apples at (6,2) is gone now.\n\nWait, looking back, the last move was from (5,1) to (6,1), eating an apple there. Oh, so in the last move, the snake moved from (5,1) to (6,1), which was an apple, so that apple is now gone. So the current position is (6,1), but after that, the next move was UP to (6,2), which is where I am now.\n\nSo currently, the apples left are at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). Wait, no, in the board state, the apples are at positions (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). Because in row 7, column 7 and 6, there are two apples. So I'm at (6,2), and the closest apple is probably (6,7), which is directly above me, 5 units up.\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (7,5). So I need to avoid moving into that position or any other part of their body, but their body is empty right now, so only the head is at (7,5).\n\nSo, let's think about possible directions:\n\n- UP: Moving up would take me towards (6,3), getting closer to (6,7). That's a good path. But I need to make sure that moving up doesn't lead me into a collision with the enemy or the walls.\n\n- RIGHT: Moving right would take me to (7,2). From there, maybe I can go up towards (7,7), but that's further away. Also, snake #2 is at (7,5), so if I go to (7,2) and up, I might cross paths with them.\n\n- LEFT: Moving left to (5,2). That seems away from the apples. Not useful unless I want to avoid something, but I don't see a reason to go that way.\n\n- DOWN: Moving down to (6,1). But that's where I was before, and moving down from (6,2) would mean going back, which could cause me to run into my own body if I have any. Wait, I just moved to (6,2) from (6,1). So my snake's body is now at (6,1) and (6,2). So moving back down would make me go into (6,1), which is part of my body, causing me to die. So I can't move down.\n\nSo, the only safe directions are UP and RIGHT. Moving LEFT or DOWN is either unhelpful or dangerous.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, moving UP is better because it's a straight path towards the apple at (6,7). Moving RIGHT might lead me towards the enemy snake's position, so that's a risk.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move UP again to (6,3). This gets me closer to the apple at (6,7) and avoids the enemy snake for now.\n\nI should also plan for the next moves. Once I reach (6,7), I can look for the next closest apple, which would be (7,7), right next to it. So maybe moving RIGHT once I'm at (6,7) to get that one. Alternatively, if the enemy is nearby, I might have to adjust.\n\nBut for now, the next step is to move UP.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 1 in this multi-apple snake game. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. Let me try to visualize the board based on the information given.\n\nLooking at the current state, apples are located at (7,7), (3,3), (6,1), (1,6), and (6,7). My snake is at (5,1), and the enemy snake, snake #2, is at (5,5) with an empty body, meaning it's probably just the head.\n\nMy position is (5,1), which is near the bottom of the board, a bit to the right. The apples near me are at (6,1), which is one unit to the right, and at (3,3), which is to the left and up. Also, there's (1,6), which is way to the left and up.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to move next. My snake can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But I need to consider the rules: I can't move into a wall, another snake, or myself. Since I don't have a body yet, the only immediate danger is snake #2 at (5,5) or the walls.\n\nLet me check the possible directions:\n\n1. UP: That would take me to (5,2). Is that safe? Let me see if there's an apple there. No, the closest apple is at (6,1), which is to the right, not up. So moving up from (5,1) to (5,2) isn't towards an apple, but it's a valid move. But is there any obstacle there? I don't think so because the other snakes and apples are elsewhere.\n\n2. DOWN: From (5,1), moving down would take me to (5,0), which is the bottom row. That's a valid move, but there's no apple there. But maybe moving down isn't useful because I want to go towards an apple.\n\n3. LEFT: From (5,1), moving left would take me to (4,1). Is there anything important there? The apples at (3,3) and (6,1) are nearby. (4,1) is just another position, but I'm not moving towards an apple directly.\n\n4. RIGHT: Moving right from (5,1) takes me to (6,1), which is an apple! That's great because I can gain a point and grow. Plus, growing might help me in the future when dealing with other snakes.\n\nWait, but snake #2 is at (5,5). If I move right to (6,1), I'll be moving away from snake #2. Is there a risk of collision? Well, snake #2 is at (5,5), so it's above me, so moving right to (6,1) shouldn't interfere with snake #2 unless it moves down. But since I'm the one making the first move, I should be fine.\n\nAlso, the apple at (6,1) is right next to me. So moving right seems like the best option because I'll eat the apple, gain a point, and grow.\n\nWait a second, is there any other consideration? Like, after eating the apple, where should I go next? Well, one step at a time. First, I need to get the apple at (6,1), so moving RIGHT is the correct move now.\n\nAlternatively, moving up towards (5,2) would take me away from the apple at (6,1), which is right there. So I don't think that's a good idea unless I'm avoiding something, but I don't see anything in my way.\n\nSo the best move is to go RIGHT to (6,1) and eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext move: RIGHT. I'll move towards the apple at (6,1) to gain a point and grow. After that, I'll assess the next best move, perhaps towards another apple or positioning to block the enemy.\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling snake ID 1 in this multi-apple snake game. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. Let me try to visualize the board based on the information given.\n\nLooking at the current state, apples are located at (7,7), (3,3), (6,1), (1,6), and (6,7). My snake is at (5,1), and the enemy snake, snake #2, is at (5,5) with an empty body, meaning it's probably just the head.\n\nMy position is (5,1), which is near the bottom of the board, a bit to the right. The apples near me are at (6,1), which is one unit to the right, and at (3,3), which is to the left and up. Also, there's (1,6), which is way to the left and up.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to move next. My snake can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But I need to consider the rules: I can't move into a wall, another snake, or myself. Since I don't have a body yet, the only immediate danger is snake #2 at (5,5) or the walls.\n\nLet me check the possible directions:\n\n1. UP: That would take me to (5,2). Is that safe? Let me see if there's an apple there. No, the closest apple is at (6,1), which is to the right, not up. So moving up from (5,1) to (5,2) isn't towards an apple, but it's a valid move. But is there any obstacle there? I don't think so because the other snakes and apples are elsewhere.\n\n2. DOWN: From (5,1), moving down would take me to (5,0), which is the bottom row. That's a valid move, but there's no apple there. But maybe moving down isn't useful because I want to go towards an apple.\n\n3. LEFT: From (5,1), moving left would take me to (4,1). Is there anything important there? The apples at (3,3) and (6,1) are nearby. (4,1) is just another position, but I'm not moving towards an apple directly.\n\n4. RIGHT: Moving right from (5,1) takes me to (6,1), which is an apple! That's great because I can gain a point and grow. Plus, growing might help me in the future when dealing with other snakes.\n\nWait, but snake #2 is at (5,5). If I move right to (6,1), I'll be moving away from snake #2. Is there a risk of collision? Well, snake #2 is at (5,5), so it's above me, so moving right to (6,1) shouldn't interfere with snake #2 unless it moves down. But since I'm the one making the first move, I should be fine.\n\nAlso, the apple at (6,1) is right next to me. So moving right seems like the best option because I'll eat the apple, gain a point, and grow.\n\nWait a second, is there any other consideration? Like, after eating the apple, where should I go next? Well, one step at a time. First, I need to get the apple at (6,1), so moving RIGHT is the correct move now.\n\nAlternatively, moving up towards (5,2) would take me away from the apple at (6,1), which is right there. So I don't think that's a good idea unless I'm avoiding something, but I don't see anything in my way.\n\nSo the best move is to go RIGHT to (6,1) and eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext move: RIGHT. I'll move towards the apple at (6,1) to gain a point and grow. After that, I'll assess the next best move, perhaps towards another apple or positioning to block the enemy.\n\nRIGHT"

I don't want to run into it, so I'll try to move away from it. I also don't want to move down, as that would put me in a position to potentially run into the wall or another snake.\n\nConsidering all this, I think my best move would be to move to the right, which would put me at position (6, 5). This would give me some breathing room and allow me to potentially get closer to the apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to get closer to the apples while avoiding Snake #1 and the wall.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "Alright, let me think through the next move step by step based on the updated information.\n\nSo, after the last move, I moved RIGHT from (5,1) to (6,1) and ate the apple there. My current position is (6,1), and I've gained a point. Now, I need to decide my next direction.\n\nLooking at the board now, the apples remaining are at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), and (6,7). My position is (6,1), so I'm at the bottom middle part of the board.\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (5,5). I need to be cautious not to collide with it. From (6,1), moving UP would take me to (6,2). Is that safe? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are:\n\n- (7,7) which is quite far up and to the right.\n- (6,7) which is directly above me, 6 units up from (6,1).\n- (3,3) which is to the left and up.\n- (1,6) which is far left and up.\n\nSince I'm at (6,1), moving UP towards (6,2) starts me on the path towards (6,7). That seems like a good idea because it's the closest apple that's several units away but in a straight line.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (6,1) would take me to (7,1), which is empty. Moving LEFT back to (5,1) would take me to where I was before, but there's nothing there. Moving DOWN from (6,1) would take me to (6,0), which is the bottom edge, but that doesn't get me closer to any apples.\n\nSo, moving UP to (6,2) is the best option. It gets me one step closer to (6,7). Plus, moving upwards doesn't put me directly in the path of snake #2 at (5,5) unless it moves down, but I can cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nAnother consideration: since I ate an apple, my snake now has a body. So, I need to make sure that my next moves don't cause me to run into myself. But since I only have the head at (6,1) before moving, and the next move is to (6,2), there's no body to collide with yet. Once I start moving, I'll have to be careful about where I go to avoid running into my own body.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (6,2), and then continue moving up towards (6,7), trying to reach that apple before enemy snakes or I run into any obstacles.\n\nI should also keep an eye on where snake #2 is moving, but since I don't have information on its last move direction, I can't predict its movement. So, focusing on the apple is better.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,7), my next targets would be (7,7) or (3,3), depending on which is more accessible.\n\nFor now, the best move is to go UP to (6,2).\n\nUP\n\n---\n\nNext move: UP to (6,2). Strategy: Proceed upwards towards (6,7) to collect the next apple while being cautious of the enemy snake's position."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling a snake in this 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 1, currently at position (6,2). The last move was UP to get here, and I need to decide the next direction.\n\nFirst, let me check the board. The apples are at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). Wait, no, according to the initial state, apples are at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). But in the last move, I moved to (6,2), which I think might have been an apple because the last move info mentioned eating one. So maybe the apples at (6,2) is gone now.\n\nWait, looking back, the last move was from (5,1) to (6,1), eating an apple there. Oh, so in the last move, the snake moved from (5,1) to (6,1), which was an apple, so that apple is now gone. So the current position is (6,1), but after that, the next move was UP to (6,2), which is where I am now.\n\nSo currently, the apples left are at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). Wait, no, in the board state, the apples are at positions (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). Because in row 7, column 7 and 6, there are two apples. So I'm at (6,2), and the closest apple is probably (6,7), which is directly above me, 5 units up.\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (7,5). So I need to avoid moving into that position or any other part of their body, but their body is empty right now, so only the head is at (7,5).\n\nSo, let's think about possible directions:\n\n- UP: Moving up would take me towards (6,3), getting closer to (6,7). That's a good path. But I need to make sure that moving up doesn't lead me into a collision with the enemy or the walls.\n\n- RIGHT: Moving right would take me to (7,2). From there, maybe I can go up towards (7,7), but that's further away. Also, snake #2 is at (7,5), so if I go to (7,2) and up, I might cross paths with them.\n\n- LEFT: Moving left to (5,2). That seems away from the apples. Not useful unless I want to avoid something, but I don't see a reason to go that way.\n\n- DOWN: Moving down to (6,1). But that's where I was before, and moving down from (6,2) would mean going back, which could cause me to run into my own body if I have any. Wait, I just moved to (6,2) from (6,1). So my snake's body is now at (6,1) and (6,2). So moving back down would make me go into (6,1), which is part of my body, causing me to die. So I can't move down.\n\nSo, the only safe directions are UP and RIGHT. Moving LEFT or DOWN is either unhelpful or dangerous.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, moving UP is better because it's a straight path towards the apple at (6,7). Moving RIGHT might lead me towards the enemy snake's position, so that's a risk.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move UP again to (6,3). This gets me closer to the apple at (6,7) and avoids the enemy snake for now.\n\nI should also plan for the next moves. Once I reach (6,7), I can look for the next closest apple, which would be (7,7), right next to it. So maybe moving RIGHT once I'm at (6,7) to get that one. Alternatively, if the enemy is nearby, I might have to adjust.\n\nBut for now, the next step is to move UP.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake is at (8,5), so I should keep an eye on where they are.

The last move I made was UP, which took me to this position. I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (7,7), (3,3), (1,6), (6,7), and (2,9). My closest apple is at (6,7), which is straight up from where I am. That seems like a good target because it's along the same x-coordinate, so I can just keep moving up each turn.\n\nBut wait, I should check if moving up is safe. Let me look at the positions of the enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (9,5), and the board shows it with an empty body, so maybe it's moving towards an apple. But since I'm at (6,4), moving up to (6,5) won't interfere with Snake #2 unless it's also moving towards that area.\n\nAnother thing to consider is where the other apples are. There's one at (3,3) to my left and down, but that's a bit further. The apple at (1,6) is also to the left and up, but again, not as close as (6,7). The apple at (2,9) is even further up and to the left. So, (6,7) is definitely the most accessible.\n\nI should also think about my snake's body. Since I'm at (6,4), and I moved up from (6,3), my body probably extends down from here. Moving up again won't make me collide with myself unless I make a tight turn, which I'm not planning to do right now.\n\nSo, the plan is to move UP to (6,5) next. This keeps me on track to reach the apple at (6,7). I should check again next turn if there are any obstacles or if the enemy is moving towards the same apple. But for now, UP is the safest and most efficient move.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake if it's also heading towards (6,7). Snake #2 is at (9,5), so it might go towards the apple at (7,7). If that's the case, it might not interfere with my path, but I'll have to keep an eye on it in future moves.\n\nAnother consideration is the boundaries. Moving up to (6,9) is possible, but I don't think that's necessary yet. I just need to reach (6,7) first.\n\nIn summary, moving UP to (6,5) is the best choice to reach the closest apple without any immediate threats. I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\n\nUP"
