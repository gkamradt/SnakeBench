The apples I need to focus on are located at (8, 4), (0, 1), (7, 1), (8, 5), and (2, 2). The enemy snake (Snake #2) is positioned at (2, 3) with its body currently empty, meaning I need to be cautious of it potentially blocking my moves. \n\nExamining my options from (1, 2):\n1. **UP (to (1, 3))**: This is not allowed since I just came from (1, 3).\n2. **DOWN (to (1, 1))**: This spot is empty and I can safely move here, but it doesn't get me closer to the apples.\n3. **LEFT (to (0, 2))**: This is also an empty cell but moves me further away from the most immediate apple (which is (2, 2)).\n4. **RIGHT (to (2, 2))**: Okay, this is critical. This cell contains an apple! Not only would I get closer to more apples, but it also allows me to grow my snake by one segment. However, I must consider that I'd be adjacent to Snake #2, which is currently at (2, 3).\n\nThe potential risk is that Snake #2 might move down to (2, 4) blocking my escape route, or I could be trapped if Snake #2 decides to move downwards. Given that it's a game with limited moves, the chance of gaining an apple is important.\n\nAfter evaluating the risks and the advantages, I feel that moving to (2, 2) is well worth it \u2013 I will grow and score a point, which is crucial for my strategy in getting ahead. Though proximity to Snake #2 poses a risk, it\u2019s a calculated one and brings me immediate benefit.\n\nSo, my next move is:\n\n**RIGHT** (to (2, 2))."
