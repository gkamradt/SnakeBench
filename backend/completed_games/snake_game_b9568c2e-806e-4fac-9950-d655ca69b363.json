Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (6,6), which is in the middle of the board. The apples are located at (2,6), (5,6), (2,1), (3,3), and (5,3). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without running into any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (2,6) and (5,6) are on the same row as my current position. The other apples are at (2,1), (3,3), and (5,3). Since I'm at (6,6), moving left along the same row could be a good idea because there are two apples there. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,8) with an empty body, so it's not a threat right now. I don't have to worry about it unless I get too close. My main concern is avoiding walls and my own body, but since my body isn't shown, I assume it's just me at (6,6) right now.\n\nIf I move left from (6,6) to (5,6), I'll be on an apple and gain a point. That seems straightforward. Alternatively, I could move down to (6,5), but there's no apple there. Moving up would take me to (6,7), which is also empty. Moving right would take me to (7,6), which is also empty.\n\nSo, moving left to (5,6) would give me an apple immediately. That's a good move because it's right in front of me. Alternatively, I could consider moving further left to (2,6), but that would require multiple moves, and I might not get the chance if another snake takes it first. Since I'm at (6,6), moving left one step to (5,6) is the quickest way to get an apple.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After taking the apple at (5,6), I can decide whether to go for another apple nearby, like (5,3). That would require moving down, but I need to make sure I don't block myself or run into walls.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (3,3), but that's further away. Maybe it's better to take the closer apples first. So, moving left to (5,6) seems like the best immediate move.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes or walls, so I think moving left is safe. It's a direct path to an apple, which will help me grow and gain points quickly.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT to (5,6) to collect the apple there.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,6).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (2,6), (5,6), (2,1), (3,3), and (5,3).\n3. **Immediate Opportunities:** Moving left to (5,6) will collect an apple immediately.\n4. **Safety Check:** No enemy snakes nearby, and moving left doesn't risk collision with walls or self.\n5. **Strategy:** Collect the closest apple to grow and gain points quickly.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"
