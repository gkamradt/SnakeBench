Avoid getting trapped near walls or the enemy snake once I'm down closer to (6, 2).\n- **Board Edges**: Monitor surroundings as I move downward to ensure I have routes to escape if Snake #2 becomes a threat.\n\n### Long-term Strategy\n- After consuming the apple at (6, 2), the focus will be on remaining apples, primarily those closest and least contested, depending on Snake #2's moves.\n\n### Next Move\nGiven these factors and plans, my best decision is to continue moving DOWN, staying on course toward the apple at (6, 2).\n\nDecided Move: **DOWN**"

I'm three spaces away vertically down from it.\n3. **Enemy Snake**: Snake #2 is at (7, 1) with its body trailing at (6, 1). It's close to the apple at (6, 0) and may move towards it.\n\n### Updated Objectives\n\n- **Path to Apple**: Continuing towards the apple at (6, 2).\n- **Threat Assessment**: Monitoring Snake #2's movements as it could potentially intercept apples or obstruct paths.\n\n### Move Considerations\n\n1. **Moving DOWN**:\n   - Advancing towards the immediate apple target (6, 2).\n   - No immediate threat of collision with Snake #2 if it sticks to its current trajectory.\n\n2. **Moving RIGHT**:\n   - Could risk potential future conflict as Snake #2 might maneuver unpredictably towards (6, 0).\n\n3. **Potential Hazards**:\n   - Need to stay vigilant in case Snake #2 or new apples shift my trajectory focus.\n\n### Strategy for This Turn\n\n- Prioritize reaching the apple at (6, 2) due to proximity and minimal immediate risk.\n- Continue monitoring Snake #2's behavior after this move to adapt further strategy.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven my current position (5, 5) and target (6, 2), moving **DOWN** remains the most direct and safe choice to approach my objective without immediate risks presented by Snake #2.\n\n**Decided Move: DOWN**"

This is good progress.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, being in the top right corner limits my maneuverability. Therefore, it would be wise to start moving back towards the center of the board.\n\nLooking at the positions of the other apples, the one at (6, 2) seems to be the closest and most accessible from my current position. Moving towards that apple would allow me to gain another point while also putting some distance between me and the walls.\n\nThe enemy snake at (5, 5) is still far enough away that I don't need to worry about it for now. However, I should keep an eye on its movements and avoid getting too close to it.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns should be to move towards the apple at (6, 2), while also trying to maintain a central position on the board. This will give me more options to reach the other apples while minimizing the risk of getting trapped or cornered.\n\nNext move: LEFT\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching the apple at (6, 2), reassess the positions of the remaining apples and the enemy snake. Try to move towards the next closest apple while staying in the center of the board as much as possible. Avoid getting too close to the enemy snake or trapping yourself in corners or against the walls."
