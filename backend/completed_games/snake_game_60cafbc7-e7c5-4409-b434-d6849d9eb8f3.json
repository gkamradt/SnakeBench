Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8, 1). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, my snake is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (7,4), (7,1), (5,4), (5,9), and (4,9). I notice that (7,1) is actually on the same row as my current position. That's pretty close, so maybe I should consider moving towards that apple first.\n\nBut wait, I also need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the row y=1 has my snake at (8,1) and an apple at (7,1). The rest of the row seems clear. So moving left to (7,1) would be safe and give me a point. That seems like a good option.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other apples, but they are further away. For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up. Since I'm starting, it's better to take the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nI also need to think about potential future moves. After taking the apple at (7,1), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head towards a different one. But for now, the immediate gain is the priority.\n\nAnother consideration is the direction I'm facing. My last move was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about the previous move. That gives me more flexibility.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to run into myself. Since my body is only at (8,1) right now, moving left to (7,1) won't cause a collision with my own body. So that's safe.\n\nIn terms of strategy, taking the closest apple first is a solid approach. It minimizes the risk of encountering enemies or obstacles and allows me to grow quickly, which can help in avoiding future collisions as I have more space.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, moving left to (7,1) seems like the best move. It's safe, gives me a point, and sets me up for potentially more points in the near future.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT to (7,1) to collect the nearby apple, ensuring a quick gain and maintaining safety.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (8,1).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (7,1) is immediately to the left.\n3. **Safety Check:** Moving left doesn't collide with walls, enemies, or self.\n4. **Growth Opportunity:** Collecting the apple allows immediate growth and point gain.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize closest apples to maximize points and minimize risks.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

However, moving straight up to (4, 6) would put me in a position where I would have to turn either left or right to continue towards the apple at (4, 9), as there is an apple at (4, 7).\n\nGiven that the enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (8, 1) and moving upwards, it is not currently in my path. However, I should be cautious not to move into a position where the enemy snake could potentially corner me or cut off my path to apples.\n\nTo avoid any immediate risk and to start moving towards the apple at (4, 9), I will move up first.

Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8, 1). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, my snake is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (7,4), (7,1), (5,4), (5,9), and (4,9). I notice that (7,1) is actually on the same row as my current position. That's pretty close, so maybe I should consider moving towards that apple first.\n\nBut wait, I also need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the row y=1 has my snake at (8,1) and an apple at (7,1). The rest of the row seems clear. So moving left to (7,1) would be safe and give me a point. That seems like a good option.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other apples, but they are further away. For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up. Since I'm starting, it's better to take the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nI also need to think about potential future moves. After taking the apple at (7,1), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head towards a different one. But for now, the immediate gain is the priority.\n\nAnother consideration is the direction I'm facing. My last move was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about the previous move. That gives me more flexibility.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to run into myself. Since my body is only at (8,1) right now, moving left to (7,1) won't cause a collision with my own body. So that's safe.\n\nIn terms of strategy, taking the closest apple first is a solid approach. It minimizes the risk of encountering enemies or obstacles and allows me to grow quickly, which can help in avoiding future collisions as I have more space.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, moving left to (7,1) seems like the best move. It's safe, gives me a point, and sets me up for potentially more points in the near future.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT to (7,1) to collect the nearby apple, ensuring a quick gain and maintaining safety.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (8,1).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (7,1) is immediately to the left.\n3. **Safety Check:** Moving left doesn't collide with walls, enemies, or self.\n4. **Growth Opportunity:** Collecting the apple allows immediate growth and point gain.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize closest apples to maximize points and minimize risks.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8,1). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, my snake is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (7,4), (7,1), (5,4), (5,9), and (4,9). I notice that (7,1) is actually on the same row as my current position. That's pretty close, so maybe I should consider moving towards that apple first.\n\nBut wait, I also need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the row y=1 has my snake at (8,1) and an apple at (7,1). The rest of the row seems clear. So moving left to (7,1) would be safe and give me a point. That seems like a good option.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other apples, but they are further away. For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up. Since I'm starting, it's better to take the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nI also need to think about potential future moves. After taking the apple at (7,1), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head towards a different one. But for now, the immediate gain is the priority.\n\nAnother consideration is the direction I'm facing. My last move was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about the previous move. That gives me more flexibility.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to run into myself. Since my body is only at (8,1) right now, moving left to (7,1) won't cause a collision with my own body. So that's safe.\n\nIn terms of strategy, taking the closest apple first is a solid approach. It minimizes the risk of encountering enemies or obstacles and allows me to grow quickly, which can help in avoiding future collisions as I have more space.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, moving left to (7,1) seems like the best move. It's safe, gives me a point, and sets me up for potentially more points in the near future.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (8,1).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (7,1) is immediately to the left.\n3. **Safety Check:** Moving left doesn't collide with walls, enemies, or self.\n4. **Growth Opportunity:** Collecting the apple allows immediate growth and point gain.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize closest apples to maximize points and minimize risks.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an

The board is 10x10, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, my snake is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them.

It's safe, allows me to collect the apple and grow, and sets me up for potentially more points in the near future.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (8,1).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (7,1) is immediately to the left.\n3. **Safety Check:** Moving left doesn't collide with walls, enemies, or self.\n4. **Growth Opportunity:** Collecting the apple allows immediate growth and point gain.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize closest apples to maximize points and minimize risks.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

However, moving directly towards it would put me in close proximity to Snake #1, which is currently at (4, 1) and moving upwards. To minimize the risk of a collision, I should avoid moving directly upwards for now.\n\nInstead, I can move down to (5, 8), which is a safe move that keeps me at a distance from Snake #1.

If Snake #1 continues to move upwards, I may have an opportunity to move left and then up to collect these apples without risking a collision.

Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8, 1). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, my snake is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (7,4), (7,1), (5,4), (5,9), and (4,9). I notice that (7,1) is actually on the same row as my current position. That's pretty close, so maybe I should consider moving towards that apple first.\n\nBut wait, I also need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the row y=1 has my snake at (8,1) and an apple at (7,1). The rest of the row seems clear. So moving left to (7,1) would be safe and give me a point. That seems like a good option.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other apples, but they are further away. For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up. Since I'm starting, it's better to take the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nI also need to think about potential future moves. After taking the apple at (7,1), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head towards a different one. But for now, the immediate gain is the priority.\n\nAnother consideration is the direction I'm facing. My last move was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about the previous move. That gives me more flexibility.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to run into myself. Since my body is only at (8,1) right now, moving left to (7,1) won't cause a collision with my own body. So that's safe.\n\nIn terms of strategy, taking the closest apple first is a solid approach. It minimizes the risk of encountering enemies or obstacles and allows me to grow quickly, which can help in avoiding future collisions as I have more space.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, moving left to (7,1) seems like the best move.

Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8, 1). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, my snake is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (7,4), (7,1), (5,4), (5,9), and (4,9). I notice that (7,1) is actually on the same row as my current position. That's pretty close, so maybe I should consider moving towards that apple first.\n\nBut wait, I also need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the row y=1 has my snake at (8,1) and an apple at (7,1). The rest of the row seems clear. So moving left to (7,1) would be safe and give me a point. That seems like a good option.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other apples, but they are further away. For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up. Since I'm starting, it's better to take the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nI also need to think about potential future moves. After taking the apple at (7,1), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head towards a different one. But for now, the immediate gain is the priority.\n\nAnother consideration is the direction I'm facing. My last move was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about the previous move.

The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately.

For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up.

Since my body is only at (8,1) right now, moving left to (7,1) won't cause a collision with my own body. So that's safe.\n\nIn terms of strategy, taking the closest apple first is a solid approach. It minimizes the risk of encountering enemies or obstacles and allows me to grow quickly, which can help in avoiding future collisions as I have more space.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, moving left to (7,1) seems like the best move.

The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the row y=1 has my snake at (8,1) and an apple at (7,1). The rest of the row seems clear. So moving left to (7,1) would be safe and give me a point. That seems like a good option.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other apples, but they are further away. For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up. Since I'm starting, it's better to take the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nI also need to think about potential future moves. After taking the apple at (7,1), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head towards a different one. But for now, the immediate gain is the priority.\n\nAnother consideration is the direction I'm facing. My last move was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about the previous move. That gives me more flexibility.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to run into myself. Since my body is only at (8,1) right now, moving left to (7,1) won't cause a collision with my own body. So that's safe.\n\nIn terms of strategy, taking the closest apple first is a solid approach. It minimizes the risk of encountering enemies or obstacles and allows me to grow quickly, which can help in avoiding future collisions as I have more space.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, moving left to (7,1) seems like the best move. It's safe, gives me a point, and sets me up for potentially more points in the near future.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (8,1).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (7,1) is immediately to the left.\n3. **Safety Check:** Moving left doesn't collide with walls, enemies, or self.\n4. **Growth Opportunity:** Collecting the apple allows immediate growth and point gain.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize closest apples to maximize points and minimize risks.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT to (7,1) to collect the nearby apple, ensuring a quick gain and maintaining safety.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (8,1).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (7,1) is immediately to the left.\n3. **Safety Check:** Moving left doesn't collide with walls, enemies, or self.\n4. **Growth Opportunity:** Collecting the apple allows immediate growth and point gain.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize closest apples to maximize points and minimize risks.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</response>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

The board is 10x10, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, my snake is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (7,4), (7,1), (5,4), (5,9), and (4,9). I notice that (7,1) is actually on the same row as my current position. That's pretty close, so maybe I should consider moving towards that apple first.\n\nBut wait, I also need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the row y=1 has my snake at (8,1) and an apple at (7,1). The rest of the row seems clear. So moving left to (7,1) would be safe and give me a point. That seems like a good option.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other apples, but they are further away. For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up. Since I'm starting, it's better to take the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nI also need to think about potential future moves. After taking the apple at (7,1), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head towards a different one. But for now, the immediate gain is the priority.\n\nAnother consideration is the direction I'm facing. My last move was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about the previous move. That gives me more flexibility.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to run into myself. Since my body is only at (8,1) right now, moving left to (7,1) won't cause a collision with my own body. So that's safe.\n\nIn terms of strategy, taking the closest apple first is a solid approach. It minimizes the risk of encountering enemies or obstacles and allows me to grow quickly, which can help in avoiding future collisions as I have more space.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, moving left to (7,1) seems like the best move.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8,1). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, my snake is near the bottom, on the right side.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (7,4), (7,1), (5,4), (5,9), and (4,9). I notice that (7,1) is actually on the same row as my current position. That's pretty close, so maybe I should consider moving towards that apple first.\n\nBut wait, I also need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. The only enemy is snake #2, which is at (4,5) with an empty body. So, snake #2 isn't a direct threat right now, but I should still be cautious about moving into areas where it might intercept me.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (8,1). The apples are spread out, but the closest one is at (7,1). That's just one step to the left. If I move left, I can grab that apple and grow immediately. But I should check if moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board state, the row y=1 has my snake at (8,1) and an apple at (7,1). The rest of the row seems clear. So moving left to (7,1) would be safe and give me a point. That seems like a good option.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other apples, but they are further away. For example, (5,4) is two steps left and three up, but that's a longer path. Similarly, (5,9) and (4,9) are even further up. Since I'm starting, it's better to take the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nI also need to think about potential future moves. After taking the apple at (7,1), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head towards a different one. But for now, the immediate gain is the priority.\n\nAnother consideration is the direction I'm facing. My last move was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about the previous move. That gives me more flexibility.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to run into myself. Since my body is only at (8,1) right now, moving left to (7,1) won't cause a collision with my own body. So that's safe.\n\nIn terms of strategy, taking the closest apple first is a solid approach. It minimizes the risk of encountering enemies or obstacles and allows me to grow quickly, which can help in avoiding future collisions as I have more space.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, moving left to (7,1) seems like the best move. It's safe, gives me a point, and sets me up for potentially more points in the near future.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (8,1).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (7,1) is immediately to the left.\n3. **Safety Check:** Moving left doesn't collide with walls, enemies, or self.\n4. **Growth Opportunity:** Collecting the apple allows immediate growth and point gain.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize closest apples to maximize points and minimize risks.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT to (7,1) to collect the nearby apple, ensuring a quick gain and maintaining safety.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** Snake #1 is at (8,1).\n2. **Closest Apple:** The apple at (7,1) is immediately to the left.\n3. **Safety Check:** Moving left doesn't collide with walls, enemies, or self.\n4. **Growth Opportunity:** Collecting the apple allows immediate growth and point gain.\n5. **Strategy:** Prioritize closest apples to maximize points and minimize risks.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</response>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "Given the current state of the board and the positions of the apples and enemy snake, my priority remains to collect apples while ensuring I don't run into the enemy snake or the walls.\n\nThe closest apple to my current position at (4, 6) is at (4, 9). My last move was up, and I am now at (4, 7). The next move should be directly up to (4, 8), which will put me one move away from the apple at (4, 9).\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movements. Snake #1 is currently at (7, 1) and moving upwards. It is still not in my immediate path, but I should continue to monitor its position to avoid any potential collisions as I maneuver towards the apples.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (4, 9), I will have to decide whether to continue upwards towards the apple at (5, 9), risking a potential encounter with Snake #1, or to turn towards the apples at (5, 4) and (7, 4). This decision will depend on the enemy snake's position after my next move.\n\nFor now, my next move should be UP to continue towards the apple at (4, 9).\n\nNext move: UP.\n\nFor the next turn, I will reassess the enemy snake's position and decide my next move based on the safest path to collect more apples while avoiding collisions."
