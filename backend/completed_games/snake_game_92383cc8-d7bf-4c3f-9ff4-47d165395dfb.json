Targeting them requires primarily vertical movements, with a minor adjustment to the right.\n   - Apple at (3, 0) requires a significant horizontal move, which can be riskier because it pulls me further from the remaining apples.\n   - Apples at (6, 2) and (7, 4) are relatively further away regarding x-coordinates and therefore lower priority at this stage.\n\n2. **Avoiding Obstacles:**\n   - Enemy Snake #2 is at (6, 5), and given its current position and lack of body segments, it's not an immediate threat.\n   - Being at (0, 4), I'm at the edge, so going left isn't an option. The board above me is clear for the next few moves.\n\n3. **Path Strategy:**\n   - Moving UP to (0, 5) keeps me aligned with my previous plan of heading towards the apples at (3, 7) and (1, 7).

Reassessing the proximity of apples and potential threats, we will determine the optimal move:\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Apple Proximity:**\n   - The apples positioned at (3, 7) and (1, 7) remain the most strategic targets due to their relative proximity and alignment with my current trajectory. Continuing upwards will place me in a direct path towards them after a rightward adjustment.\n   - The apple at (3, 0) presents a less immediate opportunity, as pursuing it would necessitate deviating significantly from my current course.\n   - The apples at (6, 2) and (7, 4) are still considered low priority because of their x-coordinates and distance relative to my present location.\n\n2. **Avoiding Obstacles:**\n   - Snake #2 at (7, 5) appears non-threatening given its current location and lack of a body trail. Its proximity to the apples at (6, 2) and (7, 4) makes those areas less favorable for now.\n   - Positioned at the board's edge at (0, 5), I'm restricted from moving left, but the avenue above remains unobstructed.\n\n3. **Path Strategy:**\n   - Consistently moving UP to (0, 6) aligns with my strategy of approaching the apples at (3, 7) and (1, 7). This route keeps me safe and strategically positioned to pivot right, advancing towards these targets.\n   - It's crucial to remain vigilant to potential changes in the enemy's movements or board conditions and to avoid being trapped or missing better opportunities.\n\n### Next Turn Strategy:\n\n- After moving UP, my next objective will be to shift RIGHT at an opportune moment, optimizing my path alignment towards the apples while maintaining safety from any emerging threats.\n- Continually reassessing the board is vital for adapting promptly to any positional changes by Snake #2 or new options that might arise.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

The apple at (1, 7) is even closer.\n   - The apple at (3, 0) is still too far and diverges from my intended path.\n   - The apple at (6, 2) remains unappealing due to its proximity to Snake #2.\n   - The apple at (9, 9) is even less reachable right now.\n\n2. **Threat Assessment:**\n   - Snake #2 is still distant, stationed at (7, 4) with its body extending to (7, 5).
