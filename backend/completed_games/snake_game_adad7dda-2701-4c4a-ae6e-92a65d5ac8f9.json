Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided after the last move: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) shows \". 2 A . . . . . . .\", which means at (1,2) is my head (snake 2), and (2,2) is an apple (A).

The apple at (2,3) is one up from (2,2), so after eating (2,2), moving UP could target that next. But first, secure the current apple. \n\nNo obstacles in the path. So the decision is clear: move RIGHT to (2,2) and eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: After eating the apple at (2,2), consider moving UP toward (2,3) next to continue collecting apples efficiently.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (0,2) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided after the last move: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) shows \". 2 A . . . . . . .\", which means at (1,2) is my head (snake 2), and (2,2) is an apple (A).

But for this turn, the priority is to get the apple. \n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (4,1), which is far from my current position. No immediate threat. The other apples are further away, so focusing on the closest one is optimal. Moving RIGHT now is safe and beneficial. \n\nI should also check if any other apples are reachable in fewer moves. The apple at (2,3) is one up from (2,2), so after eating (2,2), moving UP could target that next. But first, secure the current apple. \n\nNo obstacles in the path. So the decision is clear: move RIGHT to (2,2) and eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: After eating the apple at (2,2), consider moving UP toward (2,3) next to continue collecting apples efficiently.

Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided after the last move: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) shows \". 2 A . . . . . . .\", which means at (1,2) is my head (snake 2), and (2,2) is an apple (A).

So the decision is clear: move RIGHT to (2,2) and eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: After eating the apple at (2,2), consider moving UP toward (2,3) next to continue collecting apples efficiently.

From (2,6), moving towards (8,4) would require going right and up. But there's also (1,0) at the bottom left. But that's far. The enemy snake is at (5,3) with body at [(4,3)], so they might be moving around there.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,7))**: This is safe. The next apple in that direction is (0,9) which is far. But moving up could explore the top area. No immediate apple here, but maybe path towards (9,7) later.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,5))**: That's my own body segment. Can't go there, collision.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,6))**: Moving left towards the left edge. The apple at (0,9) is up there, but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best path.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,6))**: Moving right towards the center. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are in that direction. If I go right, I can start heading towards those. Let's see the path. From (3,6), next moves could be right again towards (4,6), then down to (4,5), etc. But need to avoid the enemy snake at (5,3). They might be moving around, but currently not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7) apple. But (9,7) is on the top right. That's a longer path. The apple at (8,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's calculate the distance. From (2,6) to (8,4): x difference is 6, y difference is 2. So total steps needed: 6 + 2 = 8. But moving right and down. Alternatively, maybe moving right first to get closer.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple, my tail is at (2,3). So if I move right to (3,6), then next move could be right again, but need to make sure I don't box myself in. Also, the enemy snake is at (5,3), which is in the lower middle area. If I move towards (8,4), I might cross their path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7). But (9,7) is another apple. Let's see the distance from (2,6) to (9,7): x=7, y=1. So 8 steps. That's a long way. But maybe safer as it's along the top edge. However, moving right from (2,6) towards (8,4) might be more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is just below (8,4). If I go to (8,4), I can then go down to (8,3). But there's also an apple at (8,3). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nBut right now, I need to choose the next direction. Let's think about possible collisions. If I move RIGHT to (3,6), is there any danger? The enemy snake is at (5,3), which is far. The board shows no other snakes near (3,6). So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7) is safe, but no immediate benefit. Moving LEFT to (1,6) is safe but not helpful. So the best options are RIGHT or UP.\n\nSince the goal is to get apples, moving towards the nearest ones (8,4) or (8,3) would be better. So moving RIGHT towards (3,6) starts that path. Then, next moves could continue right and down. Let's plan that.\n\nSo direction RIGHT seems better. But need to check if moving RIGHT is possible. The current position is (2,6). Moving right to (3,6) is empty. The board shows no obstacles there. So yes, safe.\n\nAnother thought: After moving RIGHT, the body will be [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. So the tail is at (2,3). Next move, if I go right again to (4,6), the tail will follow, so the body becomes [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So no collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN towards (3,5), getting closer to (8,4). But need to see the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN from (2,6) is not possible because that's (2,5), which is part of the body. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the best options are UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. LEFT is (1,6), which is safe but not helpful. So between UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I can start heading towards the apples on the right side. If I go UP, maybe towards (0,9) but that's a long way. So RIGHT seems better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: Head towards the cluster of apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while avoiding the enemy snake near (5,3). Keep an eye on the tail's position to prevent self-collision. \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided after the last move: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) shows \". 2 A . . . . . . .\", which means at (1,2) is my head (snake 2), and (2,2) is an apple (A).

The board shows that at (3,3) there's an 'A', so it's an apple. Snake #1 is at (3,2) with no body. If snake #1 moves UP to (3,3), then moving there would cause a collision.

Moving UP again would get me there in one step.\n\nPossible directions from (2,5) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,6))**: This leads directly to the apple. After eating it, my snake will grow, so the tail won't move next turn. But I need to ensure there's no collision. The current body is at [(2,4), (2,3)], so (2,6) is safe. No enemy snakes are near (2,6) based on the board state. This seems safe and beneficial.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,4))**: That's my own body segment. Moving here would cause a collision and death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,5))**: This moves away from the apple. There's no immediate apple here, but it's safe. However, moving away from the closest apple might not be optimal.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,5))**: Also safe, but no apple nearby. The nearest apple in this direction is (8,4), which is far. Not the best choice.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (4,3) with body at [(3,3)]. Their position is a few cells away from me. If they move towards my area, could that be a threat? Currently, they're at (4,3), so moving towards me would require several steps. I should monitor their movement, but right now, they don't pose an immediate threat to my path to (2,6).\n\nThe board shows no obstacles in the UP direction. The apple at (2,6) is two steps from my previous position, but since I moved UP once already, it's now one step away. Moving UP again is the quickest way to secure the apple and grow. \n\nAnother consideration: After eating the apple at (2,6), my next move would need to avoid the new body segment at (2,5) if I don't eat another apple. But since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, prioritizing the closest one makes sense.\n\nPotential risks: Are there any other snakes near (2,6)?

The apples left are (0,9), (8,4), (9,7), (8,3), (1,0).\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest apple might be (8,4) or (8,3). Let me check the positions. From (2,6), moving towards (8,4) would require going right and up. But there's also (1,0) at the bottom left. But that's far. The enemy snake is at (5,3) with body at [(4,3)], so they might be moving around there.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,7))**: This is safe. The next apple in that direction is (0,9) which is far. But moving up could explore the top area. No immediate apple here, but maybe path towards (9,7) later.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,5))**: That's my own body segment. Can't go there, collision.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,6))**: Moving left towards the left edge. The apple at (0,9) is up there, but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best path.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,6))**: Moving right towards the center. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are in that direction. If I go right, I can start heading towards those. Let's see the path. From (3,6), next moves could be right again towards (4,6), then down to (4,5), etc. But need to avoid the enemy snake at (5,3). They might be moving around, but currently not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7) apple. But (9,7) is on the top right. That's a longer path. The apple at (8,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's calculate the distance. From (2,6) to (8,4): x difference is 6, y difference is 2. So total steps needed: 6 + 2 = 8. But moving right and down. Alternatively, maybe moving right first to get closer.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple, my tail is at (2,3). So if I move right to (3,6), then next move could be right again, but need to make sure I don't box myself in. Also, the enemy snake is at (5,3), which is in the lower middle area. If I move towards (8,4), I might cross their path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7). But (9,7) is another apple. Let's see the distance from (2,6) to (9,7): x=7, y=1. So 8 steps. That's a long way. But maybe safer as it's along the top edge. However, moving right from (2,6) towards (8,4) might be more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is just below (8,4). If I go to (8,4), I can then go down to (8,3). But there's also an apple at (8,3). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nBut right now, I need to choose the next direction. Let's think about possible collisions. If I move RIGHT to (3,6), is there any danger? The enemy snake is at (5,3), which is far. The board shows no other snakes near (3,6). So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7) is safe, but no immediate benefit. Moving LEFT to (1,6) is safe but not helpful. So the best options are RIGHT or UP.\n\nSince the goal is to get apples, moving towards the nearest ones (8,4) or (8,3) would be better. So moving RIGHT towards (3,6) starts that path. Then, next moves could continue right and down. Let's plan that.\n\nSo direction RIGHT seems better. But need to check if moving RIGHT is possible. The current position is (2,6). Moving right to (3,6) is empty. The board shows no obstacles there. So yes, safe.\n\nAnother thought: After moving RIGHT, the body will be [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. So the tail is at (2,3). Next move, if I go right again to (4,6), the tail will follow, so the body becomes [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So no collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN towards (3,5), getting closer to (8,4). But need to see the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN from (2,6) is not possible because that's (2,5), which is part of the body. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the best options are UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. LEFT is (1,6), which is safe but not helpful. So between UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I can start heading towards the apples on the right side. If I go UP, maybe towards (0,9) but that's a long way. So RIGHT seems better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: Head towards the cluster of apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while avoiding the enemy snake near (5,3).

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,3) with a body part at (5,3).\n\nFirst, I need to decide the safest and most efficient direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. Let's check possible directions from the current head position (3,6):\n\n1. **UP (to (3,7))**: This position is currently empty. Moving up would take me towards the top of the board. The closest apple in this direction is (0,9) which is far, but (9,7) is also on the top right. However, moving up might not be the shortest path to an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (3,5))**: Checking the body segments, (3,5) isn't part of my snake's body. But looking at the board state, there's an apple at (8,4) and (8,3) which are to the right. Moving down might not be the best choice unless there's an immediate apple, which there isn't nearby.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (2,6))**: This is part of my own body (the first body segment). Moving left would result in a collision, so this direction is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (4,6))**: This position is empty. Moving right continues towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). This seems like a strategic move to get closer to those apples. The enemy snake is at (6,3), which is lower on the board, so moving right now might keep me clear of their path.\n\nConsidering the available apples, the ones at (8,4) and (8,3) are the closest in terms of x-coordinate. Moving right from (3,6) to (4,6) would reduce the x-distance to these apples. Additionally, the path to the right seems clear of obstacles and other snakes. \n\nAnother consideration is the tail position. After moving right, the tail will follow, so the body segments will shift, but there's no immediate risk of self-collision. The enemy snake's position at (6,3) is still a few moves away, so as long as I continue moving towards the apples and plan my path to avoid crossing into their territory, I should be safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue progressing towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Continue advancing towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while monitoring the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions.

The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions.

Now, after eating that apple, my snake's body has grown, so the next move needs to avoid colliding with the body.\n\nLooking at the apples available: (0,9), (8,4), (2,6), (9,7), (3,3). The closest one now is (3,3) which is to the RIGHT from (2,3). But wait, (3,3) is already an apple. Let me check the board state again. The board shows at (3,3) there's an 'A', so moving RIGHT to (3,3) would get that apple. Alternatively, moving UP from (2,3) would take me to (2,4), which is closer to the apple at (2,6). \n\nPossible directions from (2,3) are UP (to 2,4), DOWN (to 2,2), LEFT (to 1,3), or RIGHT (to 3,3). \n\nBut I need to check for collisions.

Moving RIGHT to (3,3) gets an apple. Moving UP to (2,4) is safe and positions towards another apple at (2,6). \n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body at []. So (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3). If I move RIGHT to (3,3), would that collide with snake #1? Wait, snake #1's head is at (3,2), and their body is empty. So moving to (3,3) is safe as long as snake #1 doesn't move there. But since we don't know their next move, it's a risk. Alternatively, moving UP towards (2,6) might be safer. \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,3), I can eat the apple there, grow, and then plan the next move. But snake #1 is at (3,2), so if they move UP to (3,3), that's a collision. However, since the enemy's body is empty, they might be moving in any direction. It's a bit risky. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4) avoids immediate collision and heads towards the apple at (2,6). That seems like a better path. Also, moving UP would keep me away from the enemy snake. \n\nSo the options are UP or RIGHT. Let's evaluate both. \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,3), I get an apple, but there's a potential conflict with snake #1. If I go UP to (2,4), I avoid conflict and move towards another apple. \n\nConsidering the goal is to maximize points while avoiding death, UP seems safer. Then, from (2,4), next moves could be UP again towards (2,5) and (2,6) where another apple is. \n\nSo the next move should be UP. That way, I avoid possible collision with snake #1 and continue towards another apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (3,3) is right there. Maybe it's worth taking the risk. Let me check the board again. The board shows that at (3,3) there's an 'A', so it's an apple. Snake #1 is at (3,2) with no body. If snake #1 moves UP to (3,3), then moving there would cause a collision.

Therefore, moving RIGHT to (3,3) could result in a head-on collision if both snakes choose that direction. \n\nIn that case, moving UP is safer. It avoids the potential conflict and continues towards another apple. \n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to (2,4). This positions the snake towards the apple at (2,6) and avoids possible collision with snake #1.\n</think>\n\nDirection: UP\n\nStrategy: After moving UP to (2,4), continue heading towards the apple at (2,6) while monitoring enemy snake #1's movements near (3,3). \n\nNext move: UP"

They might be moving around, but currently not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7) apple. But (9,7) is on the top right. That's a longer path.

However, moving right from (2,6) towards (8,4) might be more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is just below (8,4). If I go to (8,4), I can then go down to (8,3). But there's also an apple at (8,3). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nBut right now, I need to choose the next direction. Let's think about possible collisions. If I move RIGHT to (3,6), is there any danger? The enemy snake is at (5,3), which is far. The board shows no other snakes near (3,6).

Then, next moves could continue right and down. Let's plan that.\n\nSo direction RIGHT seems better. But need to check if moving RIGHT is possible. The current position is (2,6). Moving right to (3,6) is empty. The board shows no obstacles there. So yes, safe.\n\nAnother thought: After moving RIGHT, the body will be [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. So the tail is at (2,3). Next move, if I go right again to (4,6), the tail will follow, so the body becomes [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So no collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN towards (3,5), getting closer to (8,4). But need to see the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN from (2,6) is not possible because that's (2,5), which is part of the body. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the best options are UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. LEFT is (1,6), which is safe but not helpful. So between UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I can start heading towards the apples on the right side. If I go UP, maybe towards (0,9) but that's a long way.

The enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with a body part at (6,3).\n\nLast move was RIGHT, moving from (3,6) to (4,6). Now, the head is at (4,6). Need to decide the next direction. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: (4,7). Is that safe? Looking at the board state, row 7 has an apple at (9,7), but (4,7) is empty. No snakes there. Safe to move up.\n\nDOWN: (4,5). Check if that's part of my body. Current body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. (4,5) isn't in the body. So that's safe.\n\nLEFT: (3,6). That's the first body segment. Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\nRIGHT: (5,6). Check if that's occupied. The board shows at (5,6) there's nothing. So that's safe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are to the right and down. Moving right (to 5,6) continues towards the right edge. Alternatively, moving down to (4,5) would start heading towards the lower part where (8,4) and (8,3) are. Wait, (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. So from (4,6), moving right increases x, moving down decreases y. To reach (8,4), I need to go right and then down. Alternatively, moving down first might be a longer path. Let's think about the path.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,6), then next moves could be further right towards x=8. Then, once x is 8, move down to y=4. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now to (4,5), then I can go right towards x=8 but starting from a lower y. But maybe that's a more direct path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is at the top right. If I go UP to (4,7), then continue moving right and up towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's prioritize those.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (5,6) would get me closer in x-coordinate. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (6,6), then (7,6), (8,6), then down to (8,5), (8,4). That's a possible path. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (4,5) would allow me to go right and then up, but maybe that's not as efficient.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with body at (6,3). So they are in the lower right area. If I move towards (8,4), I need to be cautious of their movement. But currently, they are at (7,3), so moving towards (8,4) would be a bit above them. Maybe safe.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is at the same x as (8,4) but lower y. If I go right towards x=8, I can choose between those two apples. But (8,4) is closer in y from (4,6) than (8,3). Wait, current y is 6. To get to y=4, that's two steps down. From x=8, y=6 to y=4 is two steps down. So maybe moving right first is better.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down now to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right again, etc., but that might take longer. Let's calculate the steps:\n\nFrom (4,6) to (8,4):\n\nOption 1: Right four times (to x=8), then down two times. Total steps: 6.\n\nOption 2: Down two times (to y=4), then right four times. Total steps: 6. Same number of steps. But maybe the path is safer. If I go right first, I might be moving into an area where the enemy snake is. The enemy is at (7,3), so if I'm moving to x=8, y=6, that's above them. Maybe safer. Alternatively, moving down first would take me closer to the enemy's current position.\n\nHmm. Also, the apple at (8,3) is at y=3, which is where the enemy snake is. So maybe that apple is riskier. The apple at (8,4) is at y=4, which is one above the enemy's position. So perhaps safer to target (8,4).\n\nSo moving right now to (5,6) seems like a good step towards that. Then continue right. Also, need to check if there are any obstacles in the path. From (4,6) to (8,6), the path is clear as per the current board state. The enemy snake is at (7,3), so not in that area. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (4,5) could also be a step towards (8,4), but maybe that's a longer path. Wait, if I go down to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5), etc., but that's the same number of steps. However, moving down now might allow me to approach the apple from below, which could be safer if the enemy is moving upwards.\n\nBut considering the current positions, the enemy is at (7,3). They might be moving towards the apple at (8,3) or (8,4). If I move right, I can get to (8,4) before they do. Alternatively, if they are moving towards (8,3), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (9,7). If I move up to (4,7), then right towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. However, there's an apple at (9,7), which is on the top right. But that's 5 steps right and 1 up. So from (4,6), moving right 5 times and up once. But that's 6 steps. The apple at (8,4) is 4 steps right and 2 down. So same steps. But (9,7) is further. Maybe not the best target.\n\nThe apple at (1,0) is far to the left and down. Not worth going there now. The apple at (0,9) is top left, also far.\n\nSo the best options are (8,4) and (8,3). Let's focus on (8,4). Moving right now is the way to go. So direction RIGHT to (5,6). That's safe, no collision with self or enemy. Then next move can be RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but after moving right, the body segments will shift. The new body will be [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. So the tail is at (2,5). So no self-collision. The enemy snake is at (7,3), which is far from (5,6). So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue towards the apple at (8,4).\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Proceed rightward to approach the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). Monitor the enemy snake's position near (7,3) to adjust path if necessary.  \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Right now, a step LEFT from (5,1) moves us closer horizontally to (2,2), without risking collisions with the enemy snake at (0,2) or walls.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (0,2) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

The body is still empty, so I don't have to worry about colliding with myself yet. The apples are at (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, the apple at (2,2) is still present? Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided after the last move: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) shows \". 2 A . . . . . . .\", which means at (1,2) is my head (snake 2), and (2,2) is an apple (A).

The apple at (2,3) is one up from (2,2), so after eating (2,2), moving UP could target that next. But first, secure the current apple. \n\nNo obstacles in the path. So the decision is clear: move RIGHT to (2,2) and eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: After eating the apple at (2,2), consider moving UP toward (2,3) next to continue collecting apples efficiently.

That way, I avoid possible collision with snake #1 and continue towards another apple. \n\nWait, but the apple at (3,3) is right there. Maybe it's worth taking the risk. Let me check the board again. The board shows that at (3,3) there's an 'A', so it's an apple. Snake #1 is at (3,2) with no body. If snake #1 moves UP to (3,3), then moving there would cause a collision. But if they move elsewhere, like RIGHT to (4,2) or LEFT to (2,2), then (3,3) is safe. \n\nSince the enemy's body is empty, they might be moving towards an apple as well. The apple at (3,3) is close to them. So they might move UP to (3,3) to eat it. Therefore, moving RIGHT to (3,3) could result in a head-on collision if both snakes choose that direction. \n\nIn that case, moving UP is safer. It avoids the potential conflict and continues towards another apple. \n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to (2,4). This positions the snake towards the apple at (2,6) and avoids possible collision with snake #1.\n</think>\n\nDirection: UP\n\nStrategy: After moving UP to (2,4), continue heading towards the apple at (2,6) while monitoring enemy snake #1's movements near (3,3). \n\nNext move: UP"

But I need to check if moving UP now is safe.\n\nPossible directions from (2,4) are UP (to 2,5), DOWN (to 2,3), LEFT (to 1,4), or RIGHT (to 3,4). \n\nChecking for collisions: My body is at (2,3), (2,2), (1,2). Moving DOWN to (2,3) would collide with my own body. So DOWN is not an option. LEFT to (1,4) is safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. RIGHT to (3,4) is also safe but not towards an immediate apple. UP to (2,5) is safe and moves towards the apple at (2,6).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body at [(3,1)]. Wait, the initial state said their body was at [(3,2)]? Wait, no, in the original problem, enemy snake #1 is at (3,3) with body at [(3,2)]. Wait, no, let me check again. The user's problem statement says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n* Snake #1 is at position (3, 3) with body at [(3, 2)]\"\n\nSo snake #1's head is at (3,3), body at (3,2). So their next move could be in any direction. If they move UP to (3,4), that's adjacent to my possible RIGHT move to (3,4). But I'm considering moving UP to (2,5). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,5), that's safe. Then next move would be UP again to (2,6) for the apple. But need to make sure there's no collision. Also, need to check if any enemy snakes are in the vicinity. \n\nSnake #1 is at (3,3). If they move LEFT to (2,3), that's part of my body, so they would die if they do that. But they might move in another direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,4) might be an option, but there's no apple there. However, moving RIGHT could position me closer to the apple at (8,4) but that's far. \n\nThe safest path seems to continue UP towards (2,6). So next move should be UP. This avoids collision and progresses towards the apple. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any walls nearby? Current position is (2,4). Moving UP to (2,5) is within the 10x10 grid. No walls there. \n\nSo the decision is to move UP to (2,5), continuing towards the apple at (2,6). This path is safe and efficient.\n</think>\n\nDirection: UP\n\nStrategy: Continue moving UP to reach the apple at (2,6). Monitor enemy snake #1's position near (3,3) to avoid potential collisions in future moves.\n\nNext move: UP"

Moving UP again would get me there in one step.\n\nPossible directions from (2,5) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,6))**: This leads directly to the apple. After eating it, my snake will grow, so the tail won't move next turn. But I need to ensure there's no collision. The current body is at [(2,4), (2,3)], so (2,6) is safe. No enemy snakes are near (2,6) based on the board state. This seems safe and beneficial.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,4))**: That's my own body segment. Moving here would cause a collision and death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,5))**: This moves away from the apple. There's no immediate apple here, but it's safe. However, moving away from the closest apple might not be optimal.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,5))**: Also safe, but no apple nearby. The nearest apple in this direction is (8,4), which is far. Not the best choice.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (4,3) with body at [(3,3)]. Their position is a few cells away from me. If they move towards my area, could that be a threat? Currently, they're at (4,3), so moving towards me would require several steps. I should monitor their movement, but right now, they don't pose an immediate threat to my path to (2,6).\n\nThe board shows no obstacles in the UP direction. The apple at (2,6) is two steps from my previous position, but since I moved UP once already, it's now one step away. Moving UP again is the quickest way to secure the apple and grow. \n\nAnother consideration: After eating the apple at (2,6), my next move would need to avoid the new body segment at (2,5) if I don't eat another apple.

The apples left are (0,9), (8,4), (9,7), (8,3), (1,0).\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest apple might be (8,4) or (8,3). Let me check the positions. From (2,6), moving towards (8,4) would require going right and up. But there's also (1,0) at the bottom left. But that's far. The enemy snake is at (5,3) with body at [(4,3)], so they might be moving around there.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,7))**: This is safe. The next apple in that direction is (0,9) which is far. But moving up could explore the top area. No immediate apple here, but maybe path towards (9,7) later.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,5))**: That's my own body segment. Can't go there, collision.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,6))**: Moving left towards the left edge. The apple at (0,9) is up there, but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best path.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,6))**: Moving right towards the center. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are in that direction. If I go right, I can start heading towards those. Let's see the path. From (3,6), next moves could be right again towards (4,6), then down to (4,5), etc. But need to avoid the enemy snake at (5,3). They might be moving around, but currently not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7) apple. But (9,7) is on the top right. That's a longer path. The apple at (8,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's calculate the distance. From (2,6) to (8,4): x difference is 6, y difference is 2. So total steps needed: 6 + 2 = 8. But moving right and down. Alternatively, maybe moving right first to get closer.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple, my tail is at (2,3). So if I move right to (3,6), then next move could be right again, but need to make sure I don't box myself in. Also, the enemy snake is at (5,3), which is in the lower middle area. If I move towards (8,4), I might cross their path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7). But (9,7) is another apple. Let's see the distance from (2,6) to (9,7): x=7, y=1. So 8 steps. That's a long way. But maybe safer as it's along the top edge. However, moving right from (2,6) towards (8,4) might be more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is just below (8,4). If I go to (8,4), I can then go down to (8,3). But there's also an apple at (8,3). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nBut right now, I need to choose the next direction. Let's think about possible collisions. If I move RIGHT to (3,6), is there any danger? The enemy snake is at (5,3), which is far. The board shows no other snakes near (3,6). So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7) is safe, but no immediate benefit. Moving LEFT to (1,6) is safe but not helpful. So the best options are RIGHT or UP.\n\nSince the goal is to get apples, moving towards the nearest ones (8,4) or (8,3) would be better. So moving RIGHT towards (3,6) starts that path. Then, next moves could continue right and down. Let's plan that.\n\nSo direction RIGHT seems better. But need to check if moving RIGHT is possible. The current position is (2,6). Moving right to (3,6) is empty. The board shows no obstacles there. So yes, safe.\n\nAnother thought: After moving RIGHT, the body will be [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. So the tail is at (2,3). Next move, if I go right again to (4,6), the tail will follow, so the body becomes [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So no collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN towards (3,5), getting closer to (8,4). But need to see the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN from (2,6) is not possible because that's (2,5), which is part of the body. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the best options are UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. LEFT is (1,6), which is safe but not helpful. So between UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I can start heading towards the apples on the right side. If I go UP, maybe towards (0,9) but that's a long way. So RIGHT seems better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: Head towards the cluster of apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while avoiding the enemy snake near (5,3). Keep an eye on the tail's position to prevent self-collision. \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,3) with a body part at (5,3).\n\nFirst, I need to decide the safest and most efficient direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. Let's check possible directions from the current head position (3,6):\n\n1. **UP (to (3,7))**: This position is currently empty. Moving up would take me towards the top of the board. The closest apple in this direction is (0,9) which is far, but (9,7) is also on the top right. However, moving up might not be the shortest path to an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (3,5))**: Checking the body segments, (3,5) isn't part of my snake's body. But looking at the board state, there's an apple at (8,4) and (8,3) which are to the right. Moving down might not be the best choice unless there's an immediate apple, which there isn't nearby.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (2,6))**: This is part of my own body (the first body segment). Moving left would result in a collision, so this direction is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (4,6))**: This position is empty. Moving right continues towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). This seems like a strategic move to get closer to those apples. The enemy snake is at (6,3), which is lower on the board, so moving right now might keep me clear of their path.\n\nConsidering the available apples, the ones at (8,4) and (8,3) are the closest in terms of x-coordinate. Moving right from (3,6) to (4,6) would reduce the x-distance to these apples. Additionally, the path to the right seems clear of obstacles and other snakes. \n\nAnother consideration is the tail position. After moving right, the tail will follow, so the body segments will shift, but there's no immediate risk of self-collision. The enemy snake's position at (6,3) is still a few moves away, so as long as I continue moving towards the apples and plan my path to avoid crossing into their territory, I should be safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue progressing towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Continue advancing towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while monitoring the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions.

The enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with a body part at (6,3).\n\nLast move was RIGHT, moving from (3,6) to (4,6). Now, the head is at (4,6). Need to decide the next direction. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: (4,7). Is that safe? Looking at the board state, row 7 has an apple at (9,7), but (4,7) is empty. No snakes there. Safe to move up.\n\nDOWN: (4,5). Check if that's part of my body. Current body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. (4,5) isn't in the body. So that's safe.\n\nLEFT: (3,6). That's the first body segment. Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\nRIGHT: (5,6). Check if that's occupied. The board shows at (5,6) there's nothing. So that's safe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are to the right and down. Moving right (to 5,6) continues towards the right edge. Alternatively, moving down to (4,5) would start heading towards the lower part where (8,4) and (8,3) are. Wait, (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. So from (4,6), moving right increases x, moving down decreases y. To reach (8,4), I need to go right and then down. Alternatively, moving down first might be a longer path. Let's think about the path.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,6), then next moves could be further right towards x=8. Then, once x is 8, move down to y=4. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now to (4,5), then I can go right towards x=8 but starting from a lower y. But maybe that's a more direct path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is at the top right. If I go UP to (4,7), then continue moving right and up towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's prioritize those.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (5,6) would get me closer in x-coordinate. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (6,6), then (7,6), (8,6), then down to (8,5), (8,4). That's a possible path. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (4,5) would allow me to go right and then up, but maybe that's not as efficient.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with body at (6,3). So they are in the lower right area. If I move towards (8,4), I need to be cautious of their movement. But currently, they are at (7,3), so moving towards (8,4) would be a bit above them. Maybe safe.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is at the same x as (8,4) but lower y. If I go right towards x=8, I can choose between those two apples. But (8,4) is closer in y from (4,6) than (8,3). Wait, current y is 6. To get to y=4, that's two steps down. From x=8, y=6 to y=4 is two steps down. So maybe moving right first is better.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down now to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right again, etc., but that might take longer. Let's calculate the steps:\n\nFrom (4,6) to (8,4):\n\nOption 1: Right four times (to x=8), then down two times. Total steps: 6.\n\nOption 2: Down two times (to y=4), then right four times. Total steps: 6. Same number of steps. But maybe the path is safer. If I go right first, I might be moving into an area where the enemy snake is. The enemy is at (7,3), so if I'm moving to x=8, y=6, that's above them. Maybe safer. Alternatively, moving down first would take me closer to the enemy's current position.\n\nHmm. Also, the apple at (8,3) is at y=3, which is where the enemy snake is. So maybe that apple is riskier. The apple at (8,4) is at y=4, which is one above the enemy's position. So perhaps safer to target (8,4).\n\nSo moving right now to (5,6) seems like a good step towards that. Then continue right. Also, need to check if there are any obstacles in the path. From (4,6) to (8,6), the path is clear as per the current board state. The enemy snake is at (7,3), so not in that area. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (4,5) could also be a step towards (8,4), but maybe that's a longer path. Wait, if I go down to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5), etc., but that's the same number of steps. However, moving down now might allow me to approach the apple from below, which could be safer if the enemy is moving upwards.\n\nBut considering the current positions, the enemy is at (7,3). They might be moving towards the apple at (8,3) or (8,4). If I move right, I can get to (8,4) before they do. Alternatively, if they are moving towards (8,3), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (9,7). If I move up to (4,7), then right towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. However, there's an apple at (9,7), which is on the top right. But that's 5 steps right and 1 up. So from (4,6), moving right 5 times and up once. But that's 6 steps. The apple at (8,4) is 4 steps right and 2 down. So same steps. But (9,7) is further. Maybe not the best target.\n\nThe apple at (1,0) is far to the left and down. Not worth going there now. The apple at (0,9) is top left, also far.\n\nSo the best options are (8,4) and (8,3). Let's focus on (8,4). Moving right now is the way to go. So direction RIGHT to (5,6). That's safe, no collision with self or enemy. Then next move can be RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but after moving right, the body segments will shift. The new body will be [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. So the tail is at (2,5). So no self-collision. The enemy snake is at (7,3), which is far from (5,6). So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue towards the apple at (8,4).\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Proceed rightward to approach the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). Monitor the enemy snake's position near (7,3) to adjust path if necessary.  \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

But need to check if that's safe. The enemy snake is at (8,3), which is far. My own body is at [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)]. Moving to (5,7) is not part of my body. So this is safe and beneficial.\n\nDOWN: (5,5). Check if that's occupied. The board shows nothing there. Safe.\n\nLEFT: (4,6). That's the first body segment. Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\nRIGHT: (6,6). Check if that's safe. The board shows nothing there. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nIf I go UP to (5,7), I get the apple, grow, and the body becomes [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] (since eating an apple adds a segment). That's a good immediate gain. \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6), I continue towards the apples at (8,4) or (9,7). But the apple at (5,7) is right above me. Grabbing it now would be efficient. \n\nDOWN to (5,5) moves away from the nearby apple but could be a step towards other apples. However, the closest apple is at (5,7), so UP is the best immediate move. \n\nEnemy snake is at (8,3), which is far from (5,7). No immediate threat there. \n\nSo the optimal move is UP to eat the apple at (5,7). This also positions me to potentially move towards other apples like (9,7) next. \n\nWait, but the apple at (5,7) is in row 7, column 5. The board shows \"A\" at (5,7) in row 7. So moving up from (5,6) to (5,7) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to consume the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nDirection: UP  \nStrategy: Consume the apple at (5,7) to grow and then plan a path towards remaining apples.  \n\nNext move: UP"

Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided after the last move: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) shows \". 2 A . . . . . . .\", which means at (1,2) is my head (snake 2), and (2,2) is an apple (A).

No enemy snakes are near (2,6) based on the board state. This seems safe and beneficial.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,4))**: That's my own body segment. Moving here would cause a collision and death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,5))**: This moves away from the apple. There's no immediate apple here, but it's safe. However, moving away from the closest apple might not be optimal.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,5))**: Also safe, but no apple nearby. The nearest apple in this direction is (8,4), which is far. Not the best choice.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (4,3) with body at [(3,3)]. Their position is a few cells away from me. If they move towards my area, could that be a threat? Currently, they're at (4,3), so moving towards me would require several steps. I should monitor their movement, but right now, they don't pose an immediate threat to my path to (2,6).\n\nThe board shows no obstacles in the UP direction. The apple at (2,6) is two steps from my previous position, but since I moved UP once already, it's now one step away. Moving UP again is the quickest way to secure the apple and grow. \n\nAnother consideration: After eating the apple at (2,6), my next move would need to avoid the new body segment at (2,5) if I don't eat another apple. But since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, prioritizing the closest one makes sense.\n\nPotential risks: Are there any other snakes near (2,6)? The board state shows no other snakes in that area. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far. So moving UP is safe.\n\nConclusion: The best move is UP to reach the apple at (2,6), grow, and avoid collisions.\n</think>\n\nDirection: UP\n\nStrategy: Secure the apple at (2,6) to grow and monitor enemy snake #1's movement near (4,3) for future path planning. \n\nNext move: UP"

The apples left are (0,9), (8,4), (9,7), (8,3), (1,0).\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest apple might be (8,4) or (8,3). Let me check the positions. From (2,6), moving towards (8,4) would require going right and up. But there's also (1,0) at the bottom left. But that's far. The enemy snake is at (5,3) with body at [(4,3)], so they might be moving around there.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,7))**: This is safe. The next apple in that direction is (0,9) which is far. But moving up could explore the top area. No immediate apple here, but maybe path towards (9,7) later.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,5))**: That's my own body segment. Can't go there, collision.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,6))**: Moving left towards the left edge. The apple at (0,9) is up there, but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best path.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,6))**: Moving right towards the center. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are in that direction. If I go right, I can start heading towards those. Let's see the path. From (3,6), next moves could be right again towards (4,6), then down to (4,5), etc. But need to avoid the enemy snake at (5,3). They might be moving around, but currently not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7) apple. But (9,7) is on the top right. That's a longer path. The apple at (8,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's calculate the distance. From (2,6) to (8,4): x difference is 6, y difference is 2. So total steps needed: 6 + 2 = 8. But moving right and down. Alternatively, maybe moving right first to get closer.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple, my tail is at (2,3). So if I move right to (3,6), then next move could be right again, but need to make sure I don't box myself in. Also, the enemy snake is at (5,3), which is in the lower middle area. If I move towards (8,4), I might cross their path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7). But (9,7) is another apple. Let's see the distance from (2,6) to (9,7): x=7, y=1. So 8 steps. That's a long way. But maybe safer as it's along the top edge. However, moving right from (2,6) towards (8,4) might be more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is just below (8,4). If I go to (8,4), I can then go down to (8,3). But there's also an apple at (8,3). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nBut right now, I need to choose the next direction. Let's think about possible collisions. If I move RIGHT to (3,6), is there any danger? The enemy snake is at (5,3), which is far. The board shows no other snakes near (3,6). So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7) is safe, but no immediate benefit. Moving LEFT to (1,6) is safe but not helpful. So the best options are RIGHT or UP.\n\nSince the goal is to get apples, moving towards the nearest ones (8,4) or (8,3) would be better. So moving RIGHT towards (3,6) starts that path. Then, next moves could continue right and down. Let's plan that.\n\nSo direction RIGHT seems better. But need to check if moving RIGHT is possible. The current position is (2,6). Moving right to (3,6) is empty. The board shows no obstacles there. So yes, safe.\n\nAnother thought: After moving RIGHT, the body will be [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. So the tail is at (2,3). Next move, if I go right again to (4,6), the tail will follow, so the body becomes [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So no collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN towards (3,5), getting closer to (8,4). But need to see the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN from (2,6) is not possible because that's (2,5), which is part of the body. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the best options are UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. LEFT is (1,6), which is safe but not helpful. So between UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I can start heading towards the apples on the right side. If I go UP, maybe towards (0,9) but that's a long way. So RIGHT seems better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: Head towards the cluster of apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while avoiding the enemy snake near (5,3). Keep an eye on the tail's position to prevent self-collision. \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The apples available are at (0,9), (8,4), (9,7), (8,3), and (1,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (6,3) with a body part at (5,3).\n\nFirst, I need to decide the safest and most efficient direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. Let's check possible directions from the current head position (3,6):\n\n1. **UP (to (3,7))**: This position is currently empty. Moving up would take me towards the top of the board. The closest apple in this direction is (0,9) which is far, but (9,7) is also on the top right. However, moving up might not be the shortest path to an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (3,5))**: Checking the body segments, (3,5) isn't part of my snake's body. But looking at the board state, there's an apple at (8,4) and (8,3) which are to the right. Moving down might not be the best choice unless there's an immediate apple, which there isn't nearby.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (2,6))**: This is part of my own body (the first body segment). Moving left would result in a collision, so this direction is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (4,6))**: This position is empty. Moving right continues towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). This seems like a strategic move to get closer to those apples. The enemy snake is at (6,3), which is lower on the board, so moving right now might keep me clear of their path.\n\nConsidering the available apples, the ones at (8,4) and (8,3) are the closest in terms of x-coordinate. Moving right from (3,6) to (4,6) would reduce the x-distance to these apples. Additionally, the path to the right seems clear of obstacles and other snakes. \n\nAnother consideration is the tail position. After moving right, the tail will follow, so the body segments will shift, but there's no immediate risk of self-collision. The enemy snake's position at (6,3) is still a few moves away, so as long as I continue moving towards the apples and plan my path to avoid crossing into their territory, I should be safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue progressing towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Continue advancing towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while monitoring the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions.

The enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with a body part at (6,3).\n\nLast move was RIGHT, moving from (3,6) to (4,6). Now, the head is at (4,6). Need to decide the next direction. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: (4,7). Is that safe? Looking at the board state, row 7 has an apple at (9,7), but (4,7) is empty. No snakes there. Safe to move up.\n\nDOWN: (4,5). Check if that's part of my body. Current body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. (4,5) isn't in the body. So that's safe.\n\nLEFT: (3,6). That's the first body segment. Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\nRIGHT: (5,6). Check if that's occupied. The board shows at (5,6) there's nothing. So that's safe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are to the right and down. Moving right (to 5,6) continues towards the right edge. Alternatively, moving down to (4,5) would start heading towards the lower part where (8,4) and (8,3) are. Wait, (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. So from (4,6), moving right increases x, moving down decreases y. To reach (8,4), I need to go right and then down. Alternatively, moving down first might be a longer path. Let's think about the path.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,6), then next moves could be further right towards x=8. Then, once x is 8, move down to y=4. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now to (4,5), then I can go right towards x=8 but starting from a lower y. But maybe that's a more direct path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is at the top right. If I go UP to (4,7), then continue moving right and up towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's prioritize those.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (5,6) would get me closer in x-coordinate. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (6,6), then (7,6), (8,6), then down to (8,5), (8,4). That's a possible path. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (4,5) would allow me to go right and then up, but maybe that's not as efficient.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with body at (6,3). So they are in the lower right area. If I move towards (8,4), I need to be cautious of their movement. But currently, they are at (7,3), so moving towards (8,4) would be a bit above them. Maybe safe.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is at the same x as (8,4) but lower y. If I go right towards x=8, I can choose between those two apples. But (8,4) is closer in y from (4,6) than (8,3). Wait, current y is 6. To get to y=4, that's two steps down. From x=8, y=6 to y=4 is two steps down. So maybe moving right first is better.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down now to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right again, etc., but that might take longer. Let's calculate the steps:\n\nFrom (4,6) to (8,4):\n\nOption 1: Right four times (to x=8), then down two times. Total steps: 6.\n\nOption 2: Down two times (to y=4), then right four times. Total steps: 6. Same number of steps. But maybe the path is safer. If I go right first, I might be moving into an area where the enemy snake is. The enemy is at (7,3), so if I'm moving to x=8, y=6, that's above them. Maybe safer. Alternatively, moving down first would take me closer to the enemy's current position.\n\nHmm. Also, the apple at (8,3) is at y=3, which is where the enemy snake is. So maybe that apple is riskier. The apple at (8,4) is at y=4, which is one above the enemy's position. So perhaps safer to target (8,4).\n\nSo moving right now to (5,6) seems like a good step towards that. Then continue right. Also, need to check if there are any obstacles in the path. From (4,6) to (8,6), the path is clear as per the current board state. The enemy snake is at (7,3), so not in that area. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (4,5) could also be a step towards (8,4), but maybe that's a longer path. Wait, if I go down to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5), etc., but that's the same number of steps. However, moving down now might allow me to approach the apple from below, which could be safer if the enemy is moving upwards.\n\nBut considering the current positions, the enemy is at (7,3). They might be moving towards the apple at (8,3) or (8,4). If I move right, I can get to (8,4) before they do. Alternatively, if they are moving towards (8,3), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (9,7). If I move up to (4,7), then right towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. However, there's an apple at (9,7), which is on the top right. But that's 5 steps right and 1 up. So from (4,6), moving right 5 times and up once. But that's 6 steps. The apple at (8,4) is 4 steps right and 2 down. So same steps. But (9,7) is further. Maybe not the best target.\n\nThe apple at (1,0) is far to the left and down. Not worth going there now. The apple at (0,9) is top left, also far.\n\nSo the best options are (8,4) and (8,3). Let's focus on (8,4). Moving right now is the way to go. So direction RIGHT to (5,6). That's safe, no collision with self or enemy. Then next move can be RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but after moving right, the body segments will shift. The new body will be [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. So the tail is at (2,5). So no self-collision. The enemy snake is at (7,3), which is far from (5,6). So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue towards the apple at (8,4).\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Proceed rightward to approach the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). Monitor the enemy snake's position near (7,3) to adjust path if necessary.  \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided after the last move: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) shows \". 2 A . . . . . . .\", which means at (1,2) is my head (snake 2), and (2,2) is an apple (A).

I should monitor their movement, but right now, they don't pose an immediate threat to my path to (2,6).\n\nThe board shows no obstacles in the UP direction. The apple at (2,6) is two steps from my previous position, but since I moved UP once already, it's now one step away. Moving UP again is the quickest way to secure the apple and grow. \n\nAnother consideration: After eating the apple at (2,6), my next move would need to avoid the new body segment at (2,5) if I don't eat another apple. But since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, prioritizing the closest one makes sense.\n\nPotential risks: Are there any other snakes near (2,6)? The board state shows no other snakes in that area. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far. So moving UP is safe.\n\nConclusion: The best move is UP to reach the apple at (2,6), grow, and avoid collisions.\n</think>\n\nDirection: UP\n\nStrategy: Secure the apple at (2,6) to grow and monitor enemy snake #1's movement near (4,3) for future path planning. \n\nNext move: UP"

The apples left are (0,9), (8,4), (9,7), (8,3), (1,0).\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest apple might be (8,4) or (8,3). Let me check the positions. From (2,6), moving towards (8,4) would require going right and up. But there's also (1,0) at the bottom left. But that's far. The enemy snake is at (5,3) with body at [(4,3)], so they might be moving around there.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,7))**: This is safe. The next apple in that direction is (0,9) which is far. But moving up could explore the top area. No immediate apple here, but maybe path towards (9,7) later.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,5))**: That's my own body segment. Can't go there, collision.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,6))**: Moving left towards the left edge. The apple at (0,9) is up there, but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best path.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,6))**: Moving right towards the center. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are in that direction. If I go right, I can start heading towards those. Let's see the path. From (3,6), next moves could be right again towards (4,6), then down to (4,5), etc. But need to avoid the enemy snake at (5,3). They might be moving around, but currently not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7) apple. But (9,7) is on the top right. That's a longer path. The apple at (8,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's calculate the distance. From (2,6) to (8,4): x difference is 6, y difference is 2. So total steps needed: 6 + 2 = 8. But moving right and down. Alternatively, maybe moving right first to get closer.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple, my tail is at (2,3). So if I move right to (3,6), then next move could be right again, but need to make sure I don't box myself in. Also, the enemy snake is at (5,3), which is in the lower middle area. If I move towards (8,4), I might cross their path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7). But (9,7) is another apple. Let's see the distance from (2,6) to (9,7): x=7, y=1. So 8 steps. That's a long way. But maybe safer as it's along the top edge. However, moving right from (2,6) towards (8,4) might be more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is just below (8,4). If I go to (8,4), I can then go down to (8,3). But there's also an apple at (8,3). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nBut right now, I need to choose the next direction. Let's think about possible collisions. If I move RIGHT to (3,6), is there any danger? The enemy snake is at (5,3), which is far. The board shows no other snakes near (3,6). So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7) is safe, but no immediate benefit. Moving LEFT to (1,6) is safe but not helpful. So the best options are RIGHT or UP.\n\nSince the goal is to get apples, moving towards the nearest ones (8,4) or (8,3) would be better. So moving RIGHT towards (3,6) starts that path. Then, next moves could continue right and down. Let's plan that.\n\nSo direction RIGHT seems better. But need to check if moving RIGHT is possible. The current position is (2,6). Moving right to (3,6) is empty. The board shows no obstacles there. So yes, safe.\n\nAnother thought: After moving RIGHT, the body will be [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. So the tail is at (2,3). Next move, if I go right again to (4,6), the tail will follow, so the body becomes [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So no collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN towards (3,5), getting closer to (8,4). But need to see the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN from (2,6) is not possible because that's (2,5), which is part of the body. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the best options are UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. LEFT is (1,6), which is safe but not helpful. So between UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I can start heading towards the apples on the right side. If I go UP, maybe towards (0,9) but that's a long way. So RIGHT seems better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: Head towards the cluster of apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while avoiding the enemy snake near (5,3). Keep an eye on the tail's position to prevent self-collision. \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The apples available are at (0,9), (8,4), (9,7), (8,3), and (1,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (6,3) with a body part at (5,3).\n\nFirst, I need to decide the safest and most efficient direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. Let's check possible directions from the current head position (3,6):\n\n1. **UP (to (3,7))**: This position is currently empty. Moving up would take me towards the top of the board. The closest apple in this direction is (0,9) which is far, but (9,7) is also on the top right. However, moving up might not be the shortest path to an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (3,5))**: Checking the body segments, (3,5) isn't part of my snake's body. But looking at the board state, there's an apple at (8,4) and (8,3) which are to the right. Moving down might not be the best choice unless there's an immediate apple, which there isn't nearby.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (2,6))**: This is part of my own body (the first body segment). Moving left would result in a collision, so this direction is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (4,6))**: This position is empty. Moving right continues towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). This seems like a strategic move to get closer to those apples. The enemy snake is at (6,3), which is lower on the board, so moving right now might keep me clear of their path.\n\nConsidering the available apples, the ones at (8,4) and (8,3) are the closest in terms of x-coordinate. Moving right from (3,6) to (4,6) would reduce the x-distance to these apples. Additionally, the path to the right seems clear of obstacles and other snakes. \n\nAnother consideration is the tail position. After moving right, the tail will follow, so the body segments will shift, but there's no immediate risk of self-collision. The enemy snake's position at (6,3) is still a few moves away, so as long as I continue moving towards the apples and plan my path to avoid crossing into their territory, I should be safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue progressing towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Continue advancing towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while monitoring the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions.

The enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with a body part at (6,3).\n\nLast move was RIGHT, moving from (3,6) to (4,6). Now, the head is at (4,6). Need to decide the next direction. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: (4,7). Is that safe? Looking at the board state, row 7 has an apple at (9,7), but (4,7) is empty. No snakes there. Safe to move up.\n\nDOWN: (4,5). Check if that's part of my body. Current body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. (4,5) isn't in the body. So that's safe.\n\nLEFT: (3,6). That's the first body segment. Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\nRIGHT: (5,6). Check if that's occupied. The board shows at (5,6) there's nothing. So that's safe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are to the right and down. Moving right (to 5,6) continues towards the right edge. Alternatively, moving down to (4,5) would start heading towards the lower part where (8,4) and (8,3) are. Wait, (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. So from (4,6), moving right increases x, moving down decreases y. To reach (8,4), I need to go right and then down. Alternatively, moving down first might be a longer path. Let's think about the path.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,6), then next moves could be further right towards x=8. Then, once x is 8, move down to y=4. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now to (4,5), then I can go right towards x=8 but starting from a lower y. But maybe that's a more direct path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is at the top right. If I go UP to (4,7), then continue moving right and up towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's prioritize those.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (5,6) would get me closer in x-coordinate. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (6,6), then (7,6), (8,6), then down to (8,5), (8,4). That's a possible path. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (4,5) would allow me to go right and then up, but maybe that's not as efficient.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with body at (6,3). So they are in the lower right area. If I move towards (8,4), I need to be cautious of their movement. But currently, they are at (7,3), so moving towards (8,4) would be a bit above them. Maybe safe.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is at the same x as (8,4) but lower y. If I go right towards x=8, I can choose between those two apples. But (8,4) is closer in y from (4,6) than (8,3). Wait, current y is 6. To get to y=4, that's two steps down. From x=8, y=6 to y=4 is two steps down. So maybe moving right first is better.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down now to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right again, etc., but that might take longer. Let's calculate the steps:\n\nFrom (4,6) to (8,4):\n\nOption 1: Right four times (to x=8), then down two times. Total steps: 6.\n\nOption 2: Down two times (to y=4), then right four times. Total steps: 6. Same number of steps. But maybe the path is safer. If I go right first, I might be moving into an area where the enemy snake is. The enemy is at (7,3), so if I'm moving to x=8, y=6, that's above them. Maybe safer. Alternatively, moving down first would take me closer to the enemy's current position.\n\nHmm. Also, the apple at (8,3) is at y=3, which is where the enemy snake is. So maybe that apple is riskier. The apple at (8,4) is at y=4, which is one above the enemy's position. So perhaps safer to target (8,4).\n\nSo moving right now to (5,6) seems like a good step towards that. Then continue right. Also, need to check if there are any obstacles in the path. From (4,6) to (8,6), the path is clear as per the current board state. The enemy snake is at (7,3), so not in that area. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (4,5) could also be a step towards (8,4), but maybe that's a longer path. Wait, if I go down to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5), etc., but that's the same number of steps. However, moving down now might allow me to approach the apple from below, which could be safer if the enemy is moving upwards.\n\nBut considering the current positions, the enemy is at (7,3). They might be moving towards the apple at (8,3) or (8,4). If I move right, I can get to (8,4) before they do. Alternatively, if they are moving towards (8,3), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (9,7). If I move up to (4,7), then right towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. However, there's an apple at (9,7), which is on the top right. But that's 5 steps right and 1 up. So from (4,6), moving right 5 times and up once. But that's 6 steps. The apple at (8,4) is 4 steps right and 2 down. So same steps. But (9,7) is further. Maybe not the best target.\n\nThe apple at (1,0) is far to the left and down. Not worth going there now. The apple at (0,9) is top left, also far.\n\nSo the best options are (8,4) and (8,3). Let's focus on (8,4). Moving right now is the way to go. So direction RIGHT to (5,6). That's safe, no collision with self or enemy. Then next move can be RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but after moving right, the body segments will shift. The new body will be [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. So the tail is at (2,5). So no self-collision. The enemy snake is at (7,3), which is far from (5,6). So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue towards the apple at (8,4).\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Proceed rightward to approach the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). Monitor the enemy snake's position near (7,3) to adjust path if necessary.  \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (6,7) with the body segments at [(5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. The apples available are at (0,9), (9,7), (1,0), (4,0), and (9,2). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (8,5) with body parts at [(8,4), (8,3), (7,3)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from the current head position (6,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (6,8). The board's top is y=9, so this is valid. Are there any obstacles? The current board state shows nothing at (6,8). Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (6,6). Check if this is part of my body. My body segments are [(5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. (6,6) isn't listed, so it's safe. Wait, but looking at the board state provided, the snake's body is at [(5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. So (6,6) is empty. But need to confirm from the board diagram. The board shows at row 6 (y=6), columns 3-5 have T (my body parts). So (6,6) is empty. So DOWN is possible.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (5,7). That's the first body segment. So that's a collision. Can't go LEFT.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (7,7). Check the board. The board at row 7 (y=7) shows a '2' at (6,7), then dots after. So (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nWait, the current head is at (6,7). The body is [(5,7), (5,6), etc.]. So moving LEFT would go to (5,7), which is part of the body. So LEFT is invalid. \n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest ones are (9,7) and (0,9). Let's evaluate each direction's path towards apples.\n\n**UP (6,8)**: This moves towards the top. The apple at (0,9) is far. From (6,8), the path to (0,9) would require moving left across the board, but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe other apples. Not the most direct path.\n\n**DOWN (6,6)**: Moving down to (6,6). From there, possible directions could be left towards (5,6) (which is part of the body) or right to (7,6). Not directly towards any apple. The apple at (9,2) is south-east, but that's a longer path. Maybe not the best choice.\n\n**RIGHT (7,7)**: Moving right towards (9,7). The apple at (9,7) is three steps to the right. This seems like the most direct path. Each right move from (6,7) to (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) would reach the apple. Need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. The board shows at row 7 (y=7), columns 6 is '2', then dots. So (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) are empty except for the apple at (9,7). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,5), which is two rows below. So moving right along row 7 should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake's position. Snake #1 is at (8,5) with body parts extending down. They might be moving towards their own goals, but currently, their head is at (8,5), which is not in the immediate path of my snake's movement towards (9,7).\n\nAlso, need to avoid getting trapped. Moving right towards (9,7) gives a clear path. Once the apple is eaten, the snake will grow, so planning the next moves after that is important. But for the current move, the priority is to reach the apple safely.\n\nAlternative apples: (1,0) and (4,0) are at the bottom. But those are far from the current position. The apple at (9,2) is also south-east, but again, moving right towards (9,7) is closer.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (7,7), continuing towards the apple at (9,7). This path is clear and the shortest route to an apple. UP and DOWN don't lead directly to apples as efficiently. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions in the next steps. After moving RIGHT to (7,7), the next move would be RIGHT again to (8,7), then (9,7). All those positions are currently empty. The enemy snake is at (8,5), so their movement could vary, but unless they move up two rows, they won't interfere immediately. \n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Continue moving right towards the apple at (9,7) to secure the point. Ensure the path remains clear of obstacles.  \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Wait, but looking at the board state, there's an A at (2,2) in row 2, column 2. But my current position is (0,2), which is the bottom-left area. The enemy snake is at (5,1), so they're on the right side near the bottom.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (0,2) are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), LEFT would be out of bounds (since x=0, left would be x=-1), so that's invalid. RIGHT would take me to (1,2). So available directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut I need to collect apples. Let's check the apples' positions. The closest apples are (2,3), (2,6), (2,2). Wait, (2,2) is at the same x as my current position but two to the right. Wait, no. My current position is (0,2). So (2,2) is two units to the right (x increases to 2) and same y. So to get there, I need to move right twice. But first, moving right once to (1,2), then again to (2,2). But there's an apple at (2,2). So if I go right twice, I can get that apple. But wait, the apple at (2,2) is in the board state. Let me check the given apples list again. The apples are listed as (0,9), (2,3), (8,4), (2,6), (2,2). So (2,2) is indeed an apple. So that's a possible target.\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, right again to (2,2) to eat the apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. So moving right towards (2,2) seems like a good plan. Alternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's two steps right and one up. Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,3) is at x=2, y=3. So from (0,2), moving right twice and up once. But maybe it's better to go for the closer apple first. The apple at (2,2) is two steps right. So moving right twice would get me there, and each step is safe. But first, the first move is right to (1,2). Then next move right to (2,2) and eat the apple. That would give me a point and grow my body. But I need to make sure that moving right now is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (5,1), which is far away. The board shows that at (1,2) there's nothing. The board state in row 2 (y=2) has the snake 2 at (0,2), then in x=2, there's an A. So moving right to (1,2) is safe. Then next move right to (2,2) to get the apple. So the first move should be RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but that's a longer path. Also, moving up would require me to then go right twice. But maybe that's another option. Let's compare the two paths.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2,2) and eat the apple. That's two moves, but the first move is safe. Alternatively, if I go UP to (0,3), then next move I can go RIGHT to (1,3), then RIGHT again to (2,3) to eat that apple. But that's three moves. So the (2,2) apple is closer. So better to go for that.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (0,9) is at the top-left corner. But that's far away. The apple at (8,4) is on the right side. The apple at (2,6) is up from (2,3). So the closest apples are (2,2) and (2,3). So (2,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the first move should be RIGHT. Then next move RIGHT again to get the apple. But wait, the current position is (0,2). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. Then next move, RIGHT to (2,2) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,1), which is far away. So no immediate threat. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1) would take me towards the bottom, but there's no apple there. So that's not useful. Moving UP to (0,3) would take me towards the apple at (2,3), but as I said, that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Then next turn, move RIGHT again to get the apple. That way, I can start growing and accumulating points. Also, by moving right, I'm moving towards the center where more apples might be available later.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is empty. So after eating the apple, the body will grow. So after moving to (2,2), the body will be at (1,2). So the next move after that would need to be careful not to hit the body. But that's for the next turn. For now, the immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the closest apple at (2,2), I should move RIGHT toward it. This path is safe and avoids collisions. Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. \n\nStrategy: Target nearby apples first to grow safely while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided after the last move: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) shows \". 2 A . . . . . . .\", which means at (1,2) is my head (snake 2), and (2,2) is an apple (A).

The board shows that at (3,3) there's an 'A', so it's an apple. Snake #1 is at (3,2) with no body. If snake #1 moves UP to (3,3), then moving there would cause a collision.

Moving DOWN to (2,3) would collide with my own body. So DOWN is not an option. LEFT to (1,4) is safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. RIGHT to (3,4) is also safe but not towards an immediate apple. UP to (2,5) is safe and moves towards the apple at (2,6).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body at [(3,1)]. Wait, the initial state said their body was at [(3,2)]? Wait, no, in the original problem, enemy snake #1 is at (3,3) with body at [(3,2)]. Wait, no, let me check again. The user's problem statement says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n* Snake #1 is at position (3, 3) with body at [(3, 2)]\"\n\nSo snake #1's head is at (3,3), body at (3,2). So their next move could be in any direction. If they move UP to (3,4), that's adjacent to my possible RIGHT move to (3,4). But I'm considering moving UP to (2,5). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,5), that's safe. Then next move would be UP again to (2,6) for the apple. But need to make sure there's no collision.

Moving UP again would get me there in one step.\n\nPossible directions from (2,5) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,6))**: This leads directly to the apple. After eating it, my snake will grow, so the tail won't move next turn. But I need to ensure there's no collision. The current body is at [(2,4), (2,3)], so (2,6) is safe. No enemy snakes are near (2,6) based on the board state. This seems safe and beneficial.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,4))**: That's my own body segment. Moving here would cause a collision and death. So DOWN is not an option.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,5))**: This moves away from the apple. There's no immediate apple here, but it's safe. However, moving away from the closest apple might not be optimal.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,5))**: Also safe, but no apple nearby. The nearest apple in this direction is (8,4), which is far. Not the best choice.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (4,3) with body at [(3,3)]. Their position is a few cells away from me. If they move towards my area, could that be a threat? Currently, they're at (4,3), so moving towards me would require several steps. I should monitor their movement, but right now, they don't pose an immediate threat to my path to (2,6).\n\nThe board shows no obstacles in the UP direction. The apple at (2,6) is two steps from my previous position, but since I moved UP once already, it's now one step away. Moving UP again is the quickest way to secure the apple and grow. \n\nAnother consideration: After eating the apple at (2,6), my next move would need to avoid the new body segment at (2,5) if I don't eat another apple.

The apples left are (0,9), (8,4), (9,7), (8,3), (1,0).\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest apple might be (8,4) or (8,3). Let me check the positions. From (2,6), moving towards (8,4) would require going right and up. But there's also (1,0) at the bottom left. But that's far. The enemy snake is at (5,3) with body at [(4,3)], so they might be moving around there.\n\nPossible directions from (2,6) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP (to (2,7))**: This is safe. The next apple in that direction is (0,9) which is far. But moving up could explore the top area. No immediate apple here, but maybe path towards (9,7) later.\n\n- **DOWN (to (2,5))**: That's my own body segment. Can't go there, collision.\n\n- **LEFT (to (1,6))**: Moving left towards the left edge. The apple at (0,9) is up there, but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best path.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (3,6))**: Moving right towards the center. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are in that direction. If I go right, I can start heading towards those. Let's see the path. From (3,6), next moves could be right again towards (4,6), then down to (4,5), etc. But need to avoid the enemy snake at (5,3). They might be moving around, but currently not in my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7) apple. But (9,7) is on the top right. That's a longer path. The apple at (8,4) is closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's calculate the distance. From (2,6) to (8,4): x difference is 6, y difference is 2. So total steps needed: 6 + 2 = 8. But moving right and down. Alternatively, maybe moving right first to get closer.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple, my tail is at (2,3). So if I move right to (3,6), then next move could be right again, but need to make sure I don't box myself in. Also, the enemy snake is at (5,3), which is in the lower middle area. If I move towards (8,4), I might cross their path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (2,7) and then right towards (9,7). But (9,7) is another apple. Let's see the distance from (2,6) to (9,7): x=7, y=1. So 8 steps. That's a long way. But maybe safer as it's along the top edge. However, moving right from (2,6) towards (8,4) might be more efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is just below (8,4). If I go to (8,4), I can then go down to (8,3). But there's also an apple at (8,3). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nBut right now, I need to choose the next direction. Let's think about possible collisions. If I move RIGHT to (3,6), is there any danger? The enemy snake is at (5,3), which is far. The board shows no other snakes near (3,6). So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7) is safe, but no immediate benefit. Moving LEFT to (1,6) is safe but not helpful. So the best options are RIGHT or UP.\n\nSince the goal is to get apples, moving towards the nearest ones (8,4) or (8,3) would be better. So moving RIGHT towards (3,6) starts that path. Then, next moves could continue right and down. Let's plan that.\n\nSo direction RIGHT seems better. But need to check if moving RIGHT is possible. The current position is (2,6). Moving right to (3,6) is empty. The board shows no obstacles there. So yes, safe.\n\nAnother thought: After moving RIGHT, the body will be [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. So the tail is at (2,3). Next move, if I go right again to (4,6), the tail will follow, so the body becomes [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So no collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN towards (3,5), getting closer to (8,4). But need to see the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN from (2,6) is not possible because that's (2,5), which is part of the body. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the best options are UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. LEFT is (1,6), which is safe but not helpful. So between UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I can start heading towards the apples on the right side. If I go UP, maybe towards (0,9) but that's a long way. So RIGHT seems better.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nStrategy: Head towards the cluster of apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while avoiding the enemy snake near (5,3). Keep an eye on the tail's position to prevent self-collision. \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,3) with a body part at (5,3).\n\nFirst, I need to decide the safest and most efficient direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. Let's check possible directions from the current head position (3,6):\n\n1. **UP (to (3,7))**: This position is currently empty. Moving up would take me towards the top of the board. The closest apple in this direction is (0,9) which is far, but (9,7) is also on the top right. However, moving up might not be the shortest path to an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (3,5))**: Checking the body segments, (3,5) isn't part of my snake's body. But looking at the board state, there's an apple at (8,4) and (8,3) which are to the right. Moving down might not be the best choice unless there's an immediate apple, which there isn't nearby.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (2,6))**: This is part of my own body (the first body segment). Moving left would result in a collision, so this direction is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (4,6))**: This position is empty. Moving right continues towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3). This seems like a strategic move to get closer to those apples. The enemy snake is at (6,3), which is lower on the board, so moving right now might keep me clear of their path.\n\nConsidering the available apples, the ones at (8,4) and (8,3) are the closest in terms of x-coordinate. Moving right from (3,6) to (4,6) would reduce the x-distance to these apples. Additionally, the path to the right seems clear of obstacles and other snakes. \n\nAnother consideration is the tail position. After moving right, the tail will follow, so the body segments will shift, but there's no immediate risk of self-collision. The enemy snake's position at (6,3) is still a few moves away, so as long as I continue moving towards the apples and plan my path to avoid crossing into their territory, I should be safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue progressing towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Continue advancing towards the apples at (8,4) and (8,3) while monitoring the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions.

The enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with a body part at (6,3).\n\nLast move was RIGHT, moving from (3,6) to (4,6). Now, the head is at (4,6). Need to decide the next direction. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: (4,7). Is that safe? Looking at the board state, row 7 has an apple at (9,7), but (4,7) is empty. No snakes there. Safe to move up.\n\nDOWN: (4,5). Check if that's part of my body. Current body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. (4,5) isn't in the body. So that's safe.\n\nLEFT: (3,6). That's the first body segment. Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\nRIGHT: (5,6). Check if that's occupied. The board shows at (5,6) there's nothing. So that's safe.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are to the right and down. Moving right (to 5,6) continues towards the right edge. Alternatively, moving down to (4,5) would start heading towards the lower part where (8,4) and (8,3) are. Wait, (8,4) is at x=8, y=4. So from (4,6), moving right increases x, moving down decreases y. To reach (8,4), I need to go right and then down. Alternatively, moving down first might be a longer path. Let's think about the path.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,6), then next moves could be further right towards x=8. Then, once x is 8, move down to y=4. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now to (4,5), then I can go right towards x=8 but starting from a lower y. But maybe that's a more direct path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is at the top right. If I go UP to (4,7), then continue moving right and up towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. The apples at (8,4) and (8,3) are closer in terms of x-coordinate. Let's prioritize those.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (5,6) would get me closer in x-coordinate. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (6,6), then (7,6), (8,6), then down to (8,5), (8,4). That's a possible path. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (4,5) would allow me to go right and then up, but maybe that's not as efficient.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with body at (6,3). So they are in the lower right area. If I move towards (8,4), I need to be cautious of their movement. But currently, they are at (7,3), so moving towards (8,4) would be a bit above them. Maybe safe.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,3) is at the same x as (8,4) but lower y. If I go right towards x=8, I can choose between those two apples. But (8,4) is closer in y from (4,6) than (8,3). Wait, current y is 6. To get to y=4, that's two steps down. From x=8, y=6 to y=4 is two steps down. So maybe moving right first is better.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down now to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right again, etc., but that might take longer. Let's calculate the steps:\n\nFrom (4,6) to (8,4):\n\nOption 1: Right four times (to x=8), then down two times. Total steps: 6.\n\nOption 2: Down two times (to y=4), then right four times. Total steps: 6. Same number of steps. But maybe the path is safer. If I go right first, I might be moving into an area where the enemy snake is. The enemy is at (7,3), so if I'm moving to x=8, y=6, that's above them. Maybe safer. Alternatively, moving down first would take me closer to the enemy's current position.\n\nHmm. Also, the apple at (8,3) is at y=3, which is where the enemy snake is. So maybe that apple is riskier. The apple at (8,4) is at y=4, which is one above the enemy's position. So perhaps safer to target (8,4).\n\nSo moving right now to (5,6) seems like a good step towards that. Then continue right. Also, need to check if there are any obstacles in the path. From (4,6) to (8,6), the path is clear as per the current board state. The enemy snake is at (7,3), so not in that area. So moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (4,5) could also be a step towards (8,4), but maybe that's a longer path. Wait, if I go down to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5), etc., but that's the same number of steps. However, moving down now might allow me to approach the apple from below, which could be safer if the enemy is moving upwards.\n\nBut considering the current positions, the enemy is at (7,3). They might be moving towards the apple at (8,3) or (8,4). If I move right, I can get to (8,4) before they do. Alternatively, if they are moving towards (8,3), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAnother apple to consider is (9,7). If I move up to (4,7), then right towards (9,7). But that's a longer path. However, there's an apple at (9,7), which is on the top right. But that's 5 steps right and 1 up. So from (4,6), moving right 5 times and up once. But that's 6 steps. The apple at (8,4) is 4 steps right and 2 down. So same steps. But (9,7) is further. Maybe not the best target.\n\nThe apple at (1,0) is far to the left and down. Not worth going there now. The apple at (0,9) is top left, also far.\n\nSo the best options are (8,4) and (8,3). Let's focus on (8,4). Moving right now is the way to go. So direction RIGHT to (5,6). That's safe, no collision with self or enemy. Then next move can be RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but after moving right, the body segments will shift. The new body will be [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. So the tail is at (2,5). So no self-collision. The enemy snake is at (7,3), which is far from (5,6). So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to continue towards the apple at (8,4).\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Proceed rightward to approach the apples at (8,4) and (8,3).

Now, possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nUP: (5,7). There's an apple at (5,7). Moving here would eat the apple, grow, and gain a point. But need to check if that's safe. The enemy snake is at (8,3), which is far. My own body is at [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)]. Moving to (5,7) is not part of my body. So this is safe and beneficial.\n\nDOWN: (5,5). Check if that's occupied. The board shows nothing there. Safe.\n\nLEFT: (4,6). That's the first body segment. Moving left would collide with myself. Not allowed.\n\nRIGHT: (6,6). Check if that's safe. The board shows nothing there. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nIf I go UP to (5,7), I get the apple, grow, and the body becomes [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] (since eating an apple adds a segment). That's a good immediate gain. \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6), I continue towards the apples at (8,4) or (9,7). But the apple at (5,7) is right above me. Grabbing it now would be efficient. \n\nDOWN to (5,5) moves away from the nearby apple but could be a step towards other apples. However, the closest apple is at (5,7), so UP is the best immediate move. \n\nEnemy snake is at (8,3), which is far from (5,7). No immediate threat there. \n\nSo the optimal move is UP to eat the apple at (5,7). This also positions me to potentially move towards other apples like (9,7) next. \n\nWait, but the apple at (5,7) is in row 7, column 5. The board shows \"A\" at (5,7) in row 7. So moving up from (5,6) to (5,7) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to consume the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nDirection: UP  \nStrategy: Consume the apple at (5,7) to grow and then plan a path towards remaining apples.  \n\nNext move: UP"

Now, the next move.\n\nAvailable apples are at (0,9), (9,7), (1,0), (4,0), (9,2). So the closest ones are (9,7) and (0,9). Let's check possible directions from (5,7):\n\nUP: (5,8). But the board is 10x10, so y=9 is the top. (5,8) is valid. Then next move could go to (5,9), but there's an apple at (0,9) which is far. Alternatively, moving towards (9,7) would require going right and up.\n\nDOWN: (5,6). That's part of my body. Can't go there. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: (4,7). Check if that's safe. The board shows nothing there. Safe.\n\nRIGHT: (6,7). Also safe. From there, moving towards (9,7) would require going right more.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), then next moves could continue right towards (9,7). That's a good path. Alternatively, going UP to (5,8) might not lead directly to an apple. The apple at (9,7) is at x=9, y=7. So moving right from (5,7) would get closer. Let's see the distance: from (5,7) to (9,7) is 4 steps right. So moving RIGHT now would start that path.\n\nAlternatively, LEFT to (4,7) might not be as beneficial unless there's a path towards other apples. The apple at (4,0) is at the bottom, but that's a long way down. Maybe not the best choice right now.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (8,3) with body [(8,3), (7,3), (6,3)]. They are on the lower right side. Not an immediate threat to me at (5,7).\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,7). That's the nearest apple in that direction. Also, moving right avoids potential collision with my own body. \n\nWait, after moving RIGHT to (6,7), the next move could be RIGHT again to (7,7), then (8,7), (9,7) to get the apple. That's a clear path. \n\nAlternatively, if I go UP to (5,8), then I might have to turn right later, but that adds more steps. So RIGHT is more direct.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (9,7).\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (9,7) by moving right along the same row.  \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (6,7) with the body segments at [(5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. The apples available are at (0,9), (9,7), (1,0), (4,0), and (9,2). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (8,5) with body parts at [(8,4), (8,3), (7,3)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from the current head position (6,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (6,8). The board's top is y=9, so this is valid. Are there any obstacles? The current board state shows nothing at (6,8). Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (6,6). Check if this is part of my body. My body segments are [(5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. (6,6) isn't listed, so it's safe. Wait, but looking at the board state provided, the snake's body is at [(5,7), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. So (6,6) is empty. But need to confirm from the board diagram. The board shows at row 6 (y=6), columns 3-5 have T (my body parts). So (6,6) is empty. So DOWN is possible.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (5,7). That's the first body segment. So that's a collision. Can't go LEFT.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (7,7). Check the board. The board at row 7 (y=7) shows a '2' at (6,7), then dots after. So (7,7) is empty. Safe.\n\nWait, the current head is at (6,7). The body is [(5,7), (5,6), etc.]. So moving LEFT would go to (5,7), which is part of the body. So LEFT is invalid. \n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest ones are (9,7) and (0,9). Let's evaluate each direction's path towards apples.\n\n**UP (6,8)**: This moves towards the top. The apple at (0,9) is far. From (6,8), the path to (0,9) would require moving left across the board, but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe other apples. Not the most direct path.\n\n**DOWN (6,6)**: Moving down to (6,6). From there, possible directions could be left towards (5,6) (which is part of the body) or right to (7,6). Not directly towards any apple. The apple at (9,2) is south-east, but that's a longer path. Maybe not the best choice.\n\n**RIGHT (7,7)**: Moving right towards (9,7). The apple at (9,7) is three steps to the right. This seems like the most direct path. Each right move from (6,7) to (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) would reach the apple. Need to check if there are any obstacles in that path. The board shows at row 7 (y=7), columns 6 is '2', then dots. So (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) are empty except for the apple at (9,7). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,5), which is two rows below. So moving right along row 7 should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: enemy snake's position. Snake #1 is at (8,5) with body parts extending down. They might be moving towards their own goals, but currently, their head is at (8,5), which is not in the immediate path of my snake's movement towards (9,7).\n\nAlso, need to avoid getting trapped. Moving right towards (9,7) gives a clear path. Once the apple is eaten, the snake will grow, so planning the next moves after that is important. But for the current move, the priority is to reach the apple safely.\n\nAlternative apples: (1,0) and (4,0) are at the bottom. But those are far from the current position. The apple at (9,2) is also south-east, but again, moving right towards (9,7) is closer.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (7,7), continuing towards the apple at (9,7). This path is clear and the shortest route to an apple. UP and DOWN don't lead directly to apples as efficiently. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions in the next steps. After moving RIGHT to (7,7), the next move would be RIGHT again to (8,7), then (9,7). All those positions are currently empty. The enemy snake is at (8,5), so their movement could vary, but unless they move up two rows, they won't interfere immediately. \n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Continue moving right towards the apple at (9,7) to secure the point. Ensure the path remains clear of obstacles.  \n\nNext move: RIGHT"

(9,7) is only one square to the right of (8,7), so we\u2019re positioning ourselves ideally to reach that food while keeping safe distance from enemy snake #2\u2019s head at (7,7).\n\n\u2022 Moving RIGHT to (9,6) puts us near the right edge.

The enemy snake #1 is at (8,6) with body parts [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible directions from (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (7,8). The board's y ranges from 0 to 9, so this is valid. Check if there's any obstacle. From the board state, row 8 (y=8) is mostly dots. So (7,8) is safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (7,6). Check if this is part of my body. My body segments are [(6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (4,6)]. (7,6) isn't listed. Looking at the board, row 6 (y=6) has some T's (my body parts) but (7,6) is a dot.

Safe.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest is (9,7), which is two steps to the right. If I move RIGHT to (8,7), then next move RIGHT again to (9,7) to get the apple. That's the quickest path. \n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (8,6). If I move RIGHT to (8,7), their head is at (8,6), which is one below. They might move up to (8,7) next turn, which would be a collision. But snakes can't reverse direction into their own body. Their body is at [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3)], so their possible moves from (8,6) are UP to (8,7), DOWN to (8,5) (but that's their body), LEFT to (7,6), or RIGHT to (9,6). If they move UP to (8,7), then if I go RIGHT to (8,7), we collide. That's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) might avoid that. But then I'm moving away from the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) could lead towards the apple at (9,2) but that's a longer path. \n\nHmm. The apple at (9,7) is very close. The risk is that the enemy snake might move into (8,7) next turn. But if I move RIGHT now to (8,7), and then next turn, if the enemy is there, I die. But if they don't move there, I can get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake can't move UP because their body is behind them. Let's see: their current head is at (8,6), body at [(8,5), ...]. So their last move was probably DOWN from (8,5) to (8,6). Wait, no\u2014if their body is [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3)], then their head is at (8,6), which is the new position. So their previous move was UP from (8,5) to (8,6). Therefore, they can't move DOWN back into their body. So their possible moves are UP to (8,7), LEFT to (7,6), or RIGHT to (9,6). \n\nSo there's a chance they might move UP to (8,7). If I move RIGHT to (8,7) now, and they also move there, we both die. But if I take the risk, maybe it's worth it for the apple. Alternatively, maybe I can take a safer route. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) would avoid the potential collision. From there, I could go towards the apple at (0,9) by moving left, but that's a long way. Or maybe find another path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) could lead towards the apple at (9,2) by moving right and down. But that's a longer path. \n\nThe highest reward is the apple at (9,7), but with some risk. If I move RIGHT now, and the enemy doesn't move UP, then next turn I can get the apple. If the enemy does move UP, then we collide. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not heading towards (8,7). Their current position is (8,6), and their body is extending down. They might be moving towards the apple at (9,2) or (4,0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the risk. The chance of collision might be worth the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move UP to (7,8) and then right towards the apple. But that would take longer. \n\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (8,7), then next turn, even if the enemy is at (8,7), I would die. But if I can get to (9,7) in two moves, maybe it's worth the risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (8,7). Let's think about their possible moves. Their head is at (8,6). They can move UP to (8,7), LEFT to (7,6), or RIGHT to (9,6). If they are going for the apple at (9,7), they might move RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7). But that's two moves. Alternatively, they might move UP to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7). \n\nBut if I move RIGHT now to (8,7), and they move UP to (8,7), we collide. But if they move RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed to (9,7) next turn. \n\nIt's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe I can take a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then right towards (9,6) and then up to (9,7). But that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) and then right towards (9,8), then down to (9,7). But that's also three moves. \n\nThe quickest path is RIGHT twice. But the risk is collision with the enemy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for that apple. Let's check the apples. The enemy snake is at (8,6). The closest apples are (9,7) and (9,2). They might be heading towards (9,7) as well. \n\nIn that case, moving RIGHT now could lead to a head-on collision. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. The apple at (0,9) is far, but maybe the apple at (1,0) or (4,0) is possible. But those are at the bottom. From (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left towards (4,0) would take several moves, but maybe safer. \n\nBut given that the apple at (9,7) is two steps away, it's tempting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is not a threat. Let's check their body. Their body is at [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3)], so their length is 4. If they eat an apple, they grow. But currently, they are at (8,6). \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,7), and they move UP to (8,7), we both die. But if they move RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is avoiding me. \n\nThis is a tough call. The safest move might be to go UP to (7,8) to avoid potential collision, but then the path to the apple is longer. \n\nAlternatively, take the risk and go RIGHT. \n\nGiven that the apple is worth a point and the game is about getting the most points, taking the calculated risk might be worth it. \n\nSo, I'll choose RIGHT to (8,7), hoping the enemy doesn't move there. If they do, it's a tie, but if not, I get the apple next turn. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy's possible moves. If they can't move UP (but they can, since their body is behind them), but their last move was UP to (8,6) from (8,5), so they can't reverse direction. Wait, snake movement rules: snakes can't move into their own body. So if the enemy snake's head is at (8,6), and their body is at [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3)], their possible moves are UP to (8,7), LEFT to (7,6), or RIGHT to (9,6). They can't move DOWN to (8,5) because that's their body. \n\nSo their possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nIf they choose UP to (8,7), then moving RIGHT now would result in collision. \n\nBut we can't predict their move. \n\nIn the absence of information, the best bet is to go for the apple. \n\nSo, the decision is to move RIGHT to (8,7). \n\nIf the enemy moves there, we both die. But if not, next turn I can get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. \n\nBut given the proximity, it's a risk worth taking. \n\nSo, the next move is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nStrategy: Proceed towards the apple at (9,7) while monitoring the enemy snake's movement to avoid collision.  \n\nNext move: RIGHT"
