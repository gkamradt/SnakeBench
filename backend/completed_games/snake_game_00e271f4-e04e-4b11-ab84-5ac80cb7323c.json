            "rationale": "### Thinking Out Loud:\n\n#### Current State:\n- **Snake Position**: (8, 7)  \n- **Apples**: (0, 8), (6, 0), (4, 5), (1, 0), (0, 2)  \n- **Enemy Snake**: Snake #2 at (5, 7) with body at [(6, 7)]  \n- **Last Move**: RIGHT (from (7, 7) to (8, 7))  \n\n#### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Move to (8, 8)  \n2. **DOWN**: Move to (8, 6)  \n3. **LEFT**: Move to (7, 7)  \n4. **RIGHT**: Move to (9, 7)  \n\n#### Analysis:\n- **UP (8, 8)**: Moves towards the top of the board. No immediate apple here, but it\u2019s a safe move.  \n- **DOWN (8, 6)**: Moves towards the bottom of the board. No immediate apple here, but it\u2019s a safe move.  \n- **LEFT (7, 7)**: Moves towards the left. This position is safe and could be a strategic retreat.  \n- **RIGHT (9, 7)**: Moves towards the right. This is the edge of the board, so it\u2019s not safe.  \n\n#### Strategy:\n- The closest apples are at (0, 8), (6, 0), (4, 5), (1, 0), and (0, 2).  \n- Moving UP or DOWN seems safe, but doesn\u2019t progress towards any apple.  \n- Moving LEFT is safe and could be strategic.  \n- Moving RIGHT is not safe due to the board edge.  \n\n#### Risks:\n- Moving UP, DOWN, or LEFT are safe but not strategic.  \n- Moving RIGHT is not safe.  \n\n### Decision:\nThe best move is **LEFT** to position (7, 7). This move is safe and keeps the snake positioned towards the center of the board, possibly setting up for future moves towards the apples at (6, 0) or (4, 5).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving to (7, 7), consider moving towards the apple at (6, 0) or (4, 5), while avoiding enemy snakes and walls.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

The next nearest apple is at (6, 0), which is 1 move to the right and 7 moves down from my current position.\n3. Moving towards the apple at (6, 0) seems to be the most efficient path, as it avoids enemy snakes and obstacles.\n4. I have been moving from (6, 7) to (5, 7). I need to change direction to move towards the apple at (6, 0).\n\nStrategy: The optimal strategy is to approach the next nearest apple in the least moves. Moving right towards the apple at (6, 0) seems to be the most efficient path, as it avoids enemy snakes and obstacles.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
