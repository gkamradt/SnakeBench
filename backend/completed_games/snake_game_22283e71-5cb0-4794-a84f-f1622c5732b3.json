There are apples at (1,6), (4,7), (9,7), (7,0), and (6,3). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,6), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . . A (apples at (4,7) and (9,7))\n\nRow 6: . A . . 1 . . . . . (apple at (1,6), snake 1 at (4,6))\n\nRow 5: . . . 2 . . . . . . (me at (3,5))\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .

I need to decide which apple to go for first, considering there's another snake at (4,6).\n\nI should think about the distances to each apple and also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (1,6): |3-1| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (4,7): |3-4| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (9,7): |3-9| + |5-7| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (7,0): |3-7| + |5-0| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (6,3): |3-6| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,6) and (4,7), both at a distance of 3.\n\nNow, I need to consider the path to each of these apples and see if there are any obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (1,6):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move up to (3,6), then left to (2,6), and then left again to (1,6).\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,6), but is there any snake in the way?\n\nLooking at snake 1 at (4,6). So, at (4,6), which is to the right of my position.\n\nSo, moving up to (3,6) is safe, as there's nothing there.\n\nThen, moving left to (2,6), should be safe too.\n\nThen, moving left again to (1,6), which has an apple.\n\nAlternatively, another path could be: left to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nEither way, it seems feasible.\n\nNow, let's consider going to (4,7):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move up to (3,6), then up to (3,7), then right to (4,7).\n\nAlternatively, right to (4,5), then up to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\nBut wait, (4,6) is where snake 1 is. If I move to (4,6), I might collide with it, unless it moves away.\n\nI don't know how snake 1 will move, so I should assume it could stay put or move in any direction.\n\nSo, perhaps going through (4,6) is risky.\n\nBetter to go around.\n\nAlternatively, I could go up to (3,6), then right to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\nAgain, passing through (4,6) where snake 1 is.\n\nMaybe not the best option.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (1,6) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the apple at (6,3):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move right to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3).\n\nThat's a longer path, with distance 5.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (9,7) is even farther, with distance 8.\n\nAnd (7,0) is distance 9.\n\nSo, (1,6) and (4,7) are the closest.\n\nGiven the risk with (4,7) due to snake 1, maybe (1,6) is a better choice.\n\nBut, I should also think about future moves and not just the immediate apple.\n\nIf I go for (1,6), I'll grow longer, which could be advantageous for blocking snake 1.\n\nBut, I also need to make sure I don't get boxed in.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (1,6), there's an apple.\n\nMoving to (1,6) would mean I need to navigate left and up.\n\nFrom (3,5), up to (3,6), then left to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nSo, first move up.\n\nThen, left, then left again.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left first to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nMaybe that's a safer path, avoiding (3,6) where snake 1 isn't.\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,6), which is to the right of my position.\n\nSo, moving left seems to avoid it.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider trying to eat both (1,6) and (4,7) in some sequence.\n\nBut that might be too ambitious for now.\n\nLet's focus on getting one apple at a time.\n\nSo, I'll aim for (1,6) first.\n\nNow, considering my immediate move.\n\nI need to move up to (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, left to (2,5).\n\nHmm.\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), that seems straightforward.\n\nThere's nothing at (3,6) as far as I know.\n\nThen, next move left to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, left to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nEither way.\n\nPerhaps moving up first is simpler.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move up to (3,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that snake 1 isn't going to block me.\n\nWait, I don't know how snake 1 will move.\n\nPerhaps snake 1 will move down to (4,5), which would be closer to me.\n\nIf that happens, then moving up to (3,6) would still be safe.\n\nAlternatively, snake 1 could move left to (3,6), directly into my path.\n\nIf that happens, and I also move to (3,6), then we both occupy the same space, which would likely result in both of us dying, or maybe just one of us.\n\nI need to check the rules on snake collisions.\n\nWait, rule 2 says: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, if I move into the same space as snake 1, I die.\n\nTherefore, I need to anticipate snake 1's moves.\n\nBut, since I don't know how snake 1 will move, I have to assume it could move in any direction.\n\nSo, perhaps it's safer to move left to (2,5) first.\n\nThen, snake 1 can't immediately block my path.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can then move up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nThat seems a more circuitous but safer route.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (3,6) might be faster, but riskier.\n\nI need to weigh the risks and benefits.\n\nGiven that I'm trying to maximize points, and points are gained by eating apples, I should prioritize eating apples while minimizing risk.\n\nPerhaps a balanced approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to position myself in a way that, regardless of snake 1's moves, I can reach (1,6).\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I move up to (3,6).\n\nIf snake 1 moves left to (3,6), then we both die.\n\nIf snake 1 moves elsewhere, then I can proceed to (2,6), then (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (2,5), snake 1 can't immediately reach me.\n\nThen, next move, up to (2,6), and then left to (1,6).\n\nThis way"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,5). There are apples at (1,6), (9,7), (7,0), (6,3), and (9,0). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,7), with its body at (4,6).\n\nLet me try to visualize the board based on the given positions.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . .

A (apples at (7,0) and (9,0))\n\nOkay, so I'm at (2,5), and there are apples around me. I need to decide which apple to go for first, considering there's another snake at (4,6).\n\nI should think about the distances to each apple and also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (1,6): |2-1| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (4,7): |2-4| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (9,7): |2-9| + |5-7| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n- (7,0): |2-7| + |5-0| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (9,0): |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\nWait a minute, in my previous thought process, I miscalculated the distance to (1,6) as 3, but it's actually 2. Okay, let's correct that.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,6) at a distance of 2, and (4,7) at a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to consider the path to each of these apples and see if there are any obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (1,6):\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, left to (1,5), then up to (1,6).\n\nEither way, it's two moves.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes in the way.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,6), which is to the right of my position, so moving left seems safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (2,6) should be safe because there's nothing there.\n\nSo, going to (1,6) seems straightforward.\n\nNow, considering the other apple at (4,7), which is farther away, and with snake 1 nearby, it might be riskier.\n\nMoreover, since (1,6) is closer, it's probably better to go for that one first.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), I can assess the situation again and decide on the next apple to go for.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that after eating the apple, my snake grows, which could potentially block the other snake or create new paths.\n\nBut for now, my immediate goal is to get to (1,6) safely.\n\nLooking at my surroundings, there are no immediate threats besides snake 1, which is at (4,6).\n\nSince I'm at (2,5), and snake 1 is at (4,6), moving left to (1,5) or up to (2,6) shouldn't put me in direct conflict with it.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious about snake 1's possible moves.\n\nIf snake 1 moves left to (3,6), that could potentially block my path if I'm trying to go up.\n\nBut since I'm planning to move left first, then up, it should still be safe.\n\nAlternatively, if snake 1 moves down to (4,5), that could bring it closer to me, but I'm moving left, so perhaps it won't be an immediate issue.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the safest move right now is to move left to (1,5).\n\nFrom there, I can then move up to (1,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without backing myself into a corner.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate move, moving left seems like the way to go.\n\nWait a second, in my earlier calculation, the distance to (1,6) is actually 1 step in X and 1 step in Y, so moving left to (1,5), then up to (1,6) makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6), then left to (1,6) is also fine.\n\nI need to decide which direction to take first.\n\nIf I move up to (2,6), then left to (1,6), I need to ensure that (2,6) is safe.\n\nSince snake 1 is at (4,6), moving to (2,6) should be safe, as long as snake 1 doesn't move left to (2,6).\n\nBut snake 1 is at (4,6), and if it moves left, it would go to (3,6), not (2,6). So, (2,6) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, both paths seem viable.\n\nPerhaps moving up to (2,6) first is slightly better, as it directly heads towards the apple.\n\nBut moving left to (1,5) also puts me in a position where I can move up to (1,6) without interference.\n\nI think moving left to (1,5) is a safer choice, as it distances me from snake 1, which is to my right.\n\nIf I move up to (2,6), I'm still relatively close to snake 1 at (4,6), and if it moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\nBy moving left, I create more space between snake 1 and myself.\n\nAdditionally, moving left to (1,5) doesn't put me in harm's way, and from there, moving up to (1,6) is straightforward.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think my best move right now is to move left to (1,5).\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best move for our snake in a multi-apple Snake game, considering the positions of apples and other snakes on the board. The goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, or ourselves.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions and Goals:**\n   - Our snake is at (2,5).\n   - Apples are at (1,6), (9,7), (7,0), (6,3), and (9,0).\n   - Enemy snake is at (4,7) with body at (4,6).\n   - We need to choose the next move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to optimally approach the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apple.\n   - (1,6) is closest with a distance of 2.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Determine the path to the closest apple at (1,6).\n   - Possible paths:\n     - Path 1: LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6).\n     - Path 2: UP to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6).\n   - Consider the position of the enemy snake to choose the safer path.\n\n4. **Avoid Enemy Snake:**\n   - The enemy snake is at (4,7) with body at (4,6).\n   - Moving left initially distances us from the enemy, reducing the risk of collision.\n\n5. **Make the Decision:**\n   - Choose to move LEFT to (1,5) as the first step towards the apple at (1,6), avoiding potential interference from the enemy snake.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a turn-based decision and doesn't require coding game logic, the decision is made through reasoning. However, if we were to implement a decision-making function in code, it might look like this:\n\n```python\ndef decide_move(my_position, apple_positions, enemy_positions):\n    # Calculate the closest apple using Manhattan distance\n    closest_apple = min(apple_positions, key=lambda pos: abs(my_position[0] - pos"

There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,6), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . .

So, at (4,6), which is to the right of my position.\n\nSo, moving up to (3,6) is safe, as there's nothing there.\n\nThen, moving left to (2,6), should be safe too.\n\nThen, moving left again to (1,6), which has an apple.\n\nAlternatively, another path could be: left to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nEither way, it seems feasible.\n\nNow, let's consider going to (4,7):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move up to (3,6), then up to (3,7), then right to (4,7).\n\nAlternatively, right to (4,5), then up to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\nBut wait, (4,6) is where snake 1 is. If I move to (4,6), I might collide with it, unless it moves away.\n\nI don't know how snake 1 will move, so I should assume it could stay put or move in any direction.\n\nSo, perhaps going through (4,6) is risky.\n\nBetter to go around.\n\nAlternatively, I could go up to (3,6), then right to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\nAgain, passing through (4,6) where snake 1 is.\n\nMaybe not the best option.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (1,6) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the apple at (6,3):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move right to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3).\n\nThat's a longer path, with distance 5.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (9,7) is even farther, with distance 8.\n\nAnd (7,0) is distance 9.\n\nSo, (1,6) and (4,7) are the closest.\n\nGiven the risk with (4,7) due to snake 1, maybe (1,6) is a better choice.\n\nBut, I should also think about future moves and not just the immediate apple.\n\nIf I go for (1,6), I'll grow longer, which could be advantageous for blocking snake 1.\n\nBut, I also need to make sure I don't get boxed in.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (1,6), there's an apple.\n\nMoving to (1,6) would mean I need to navigate left and up.\n\nFrom (3,5), up to (3,6), then left to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nSo, first move up.\n\nThen, left, then left again.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left first to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nMaybe that's a safer path, avoiding (3,6) where snake 1 isn't.\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,6), which is to the right of my position.\n\nSo, moving left seems to avoid it.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider trying to eat both (1,6) and (4,7) in some sequence.\n\nBut that might be too ambitious for now.\n\nLet's focus on getting one apple at a time.\n\nSo, I'll aim for (1,6) first.\n\nNow, considering my immediate move.\n\nI need to move up to (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, left to (2,5).\n\nHmm.\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), that seems straightforward.\n\nThere's nothing at (3,6) as far as I know.\n\nThen, next move left to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, left to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nEither way.\n\nPerhaps moving up first is simpler.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move up to (3,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that snake 1 isn't going to block me.\n\nWait, I don't know how snake 1 will move.\n\nPerhaps snake 1 will move down to (4,5), which would be closer to me.\n\nIf that happens, then moving up to (3,6) would still be safe.\n\nAlternatively, snake 1 could move left to (3,6), directly into my path.\n\nIf that happens, and I also move to (3,6), then we both occupy the same space, which would likely result in both of us dying, or maybe just one of us.\n\nI need to check the rules on snake collisions.\n\nWait, rule 2 says: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, if I move into the same space as snake 1, I die.\n\nTherefore, I need to anticipate snake 1's moves.\n\nBut, since I don't know how snake 1 will move, I have to assume it could move in any direction.\n\nSo, perhaps it's safer to move left to (2,5) first.\n\nThen, snake 1 can't immediately block my path.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can then move up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nThat seems a more circuitous but safer route.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (3,6) might be faster, but riskier.\n\nI need to weigh the risks and benefits.\n\nGiven that I'm trying to maximize points, and points are gained by eating apples, I should prioritize eating apples while minimizing risk.\n\nPerhaps a balanced approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to position myself in a way that, regardless of snake 1's moves, I can reach (1,6).\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I move up to (3,6).\n\nIf snake 1 moves left to (3,6), then we both die.\n\nIf snake 1 moves elsewhere, then I can proceed to (2,6), then (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (2,5), snake 1 can't immediately reach me.\n\nThen, next move, up to (2,6), and then left to (1,6).\n\nThis way"

So, (2,6) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, both paths seem viable.\n\nPerhaps moving up to (2,6) first is slightly better, as it directly heads towards the apple.\n\nBut moving left to (1,5) also puts me in a position where I can move up to (1,6) without interference.\n\nI think moving left to (1,5) is a safer choice, as it distances me from snake 1, which is to my right.\n\nIf I move up to (2,6), I'm still relatively close to snake 1 at (4,6), and if it moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\nBy moving left, I create more space between snake 1 and myself.\n\nAdditionally, moving left to (1,5) doesn't put me in harm's way, and from there, moving up to (1,6) is straightforward.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think my best move right now is to move left to (1,5).\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best move for our snake in a multi-apple Snake game, considering the positions of apples and other snakes on the board. The goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, or ourselves.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions and Goals:**\n   - Our snake is at (2,5).\n   - Apples are at (1,6), (9,7), (7,0), (6,3), and (9,0).\n   - Enemy snake is at (4,7) with body at (4,6).\n   - We need to choose the next move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to optimally approach the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apple.\n   - (1,6) is closest with a distance of 2.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Determine the path to the closest apple at (1,6).\n   - Possible paths:\n     - Path 1: LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6).\n     - Path 2: UP to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6).\n   - Consider the position of the enemy snake to choose the safer path.\n\n4. **Avoid Enemy Snake:**\n   - The enemy snake is at (4,7) with body at (4,6).\n   - Moving left initially distances us from the enemy, reducing the risk of collision.\n\n5. **Make the Decision:**\n   - Choose to move LEFT to (1,5) as the first step towards the apple at (1,6), avoiding potential interference from the enemy snake.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a turn-based decision and doesn't require coding game logic, the decision is made through reasoning. However, if we were to implement a decision-making function in code, it might look like this:\n\n```python\ndef decide_move(my_position, apple_positions, enemy_positions):\n    # Calculate the closest apple using Manhattan distance\n    closest_apple = min(apple_positions, key=lambda pos: abs(my_position[0] - pos"

There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,6), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . .

I need to decide which apple to go for first, considering there's another snake at (4,6).\n\nI should think about the distances to each apple and also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (1,6): |3-1| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (4,7): |3-4| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (9,7): |3-9| + |5-7| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (7,0): |3-7| + |5-0| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (6,3): |3-6| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,6) and (4,7), both at a distance of 3.\n\nNow, I need to consider the path to each of these apples and see if there are any obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (1,6):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move up to (3,6), then left to (2,6), and then left again to (1,6).\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (1,6), but is there any snake in the way?\n\nLooking at snake 1 at (4,6). So, at (4,6), which is to the right of my position.\n\nSo, moving up to (3,6) is safe, as there's nothing there.\n\nThen, moving left to (2,6), should be safe too.\n\nThen, moving left again to (1,6), which has an apple.\n\nAlternatively, another path could be: left to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nEither way, it seems feasible.\n\nNow, let's consider going to (4,7):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move up to (3,6), then up to (3,7), then right to (4,7).\n\nAlternatively, right to (4,5), then up to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\nBut wait, (4,6) is where snake 1 is. If I move to (4,6), I might collide with it, unless it moves away.\n\nI don't know how snake 1 will move, so I should assume it could stay put or move in any direction.\n\nSo, perhaps going through (4,6) is risky.\n\nBetter to go around.\n\nAlternatively, I could go up to (3,6), then right to (4,6), then up to (4,7).\n\nAgain, passing through (4,6) where snake 1 is.\n\nMaybe not the best option.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (1,6) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the apple at (6,3):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move right to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3).\n\nThat's a longer path, with distance 5.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (9,7) is even farther, with distance 8.\n\nAnd (7,0) is distance 9.\n\nSo, (1,6) and (4,7) are the closest.\n\nGiven the risk with (4,7) due to snake 1, maybe (1,6) is a better choice.\n\nBut, I should also think about future moves and not just the immediate apple.\n\nIf I go for (1,6), I'll grow longer, which could be advantageous for blocking snake 1.\n\nBut, I also need to make sure I don't get boxed in.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (1,6), there's an apple.\n\nMoving to (1,6) would mean I need to navigate left and up.\n\nFrom (3,5), up to (3,6), then left to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nSo, first move up.\n\nThen, left, then left again.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left first to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nMaybe that's a safer path, avoiding (3,6) where snake 1 isn't.\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,6), which is to the right of my position.\n\nSo, moving left seems to avoid it.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider trying to eat both (1,6) and (4,7) in some sequence.\n\nBut that might be too ambitious for now.\n\nLet's focus on getting one apple at a time.\n\nSo, I'll aim for (1,6) first.\n\nNow, considering my immediate move.\n\nI need to move up to (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, left to (2,5).\n\nHmm.\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), that seems straightforward.\n\nThere's nothing at (3,6) as far as I know.\n\nThen, next move left to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, left to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nEither way.\n\nPerhaps moving up first is simpler.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move up to (3,6).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that snake 1 isn't going to block me.\n\nWait, I don't know how snake 1 will move.\n\nPerhaps snake 1 will move down to (4,5), which would be closer to me.\n\nIf that happens, then moving up to (3,6) would still be safe.\n\nAlternatively, snake 1 could move left to (3,6), directly into my path.\n\nIf that happens, and I also move to (3,6), then we both occupy the same space, which would likely result in both of us dying, or maybe just one of us.\n\nI need to check the rules on snake collisions.\n\nWait, rule 2 says: If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nSo, if I move into the same space as snake 1, I die.\n\nTherefore, I need to anticipate snake 1's moves.\n\nBut, since I don't know how snake 1 will move, I have to assume it could move in any direction.\n\nSo, perhaps it's safer to move left to (2,5) first.\n\nThen, snake 1 can't immediately block my path.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can then move up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nThat seems a more circuitous but safer route.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (3,6) might be faster, but riskier.\n\nI need to weigh the risks and benefits.\n\nGiven that I'm trying to maximize points, and points are gained by eating apples, I should prioritize eating apples while minimizing risk.\n\nPerhaps a balanced approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to position myself in a way that, regardless of snake 1's moves, I can reach (1,6).\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I move up to (3,6).\n\nIf snake 1 moves left to (3,6), then we both die.\n\nIf snake 1 moves elsewhere, then I can proceed to (2,6), then (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (2,5), snake 1 can't immediately reach me.\n\nThen, next move, up to (2,6), and then left to (1,6).\n\nThis way"

A (apples at (7,0) and (9,0))\n\nOkay, so I'm at (2,5), and there are apples around me. I need to decide which apple to go for first, considering there's another snake at (4,6).\n\nI should think about the distances to each apple and also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (1,6): |2-1| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (4,7): |2-4| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (9,7): |2-9| + |5-7| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n- (7,0): |2-7| + |5-0| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- (9,0): |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\nWait a minute, in my previous thought process, I miscalculated the distance to (1,6) as 3, but it's actually 2. Okay, let's correct that.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (1,6) at a distance of 2, and (4,7) at a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to consider the path to each of these apples and see if there are any obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (1,6):\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move up to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, left to (1,5), then up to (1,6).\n\nEither way, it's two moves.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes in the way.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,6), which is to the right of my position, so moving left seems safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (2,6) should be safe because there's nothing there.\n\nSo, going to (1,6) seems straightforward.\n\nNow, considering the other apple at (4,7), which is farther away, and with snake 1 nearby, it might be riskier.\n\nMoreover, since (1,6) is closer, it's probably better to go for that one first.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), I can assess the situation again and decide on the next apple to go for.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that after eating the apple, my snake grows, which could potentially block the other snake or create new paths.\n\nBut for now, my immediate goal is to get to (1,6) safely.\n\nLooking at my surroundings, there are no immediate threats besides snake 1, which is at (4,6).\n\nSince I'm at (2,5), and snake 1 is at (4,6), moving left to (1,5) or up to (2,6) shouldn't put me in direct conflict with it.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious about snake 1's possible moves.\n\nIf snake 1 moves left to (3,6), that could potentially block my path if I'm trying to go up.\n\nBut since I'm planning to move left first, then up, it should still be safe.\n\nAlternatively, if snake 1 moves down to (4,5), that could bring it closer to me, but I'm moving left, so perhaps it won't be an immediate issue.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the safest move right now is to move left to (1,5).\n\nFrom there, I can then move up to (1,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without backing myself into a corner.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate move, moving left seems like the way to go.\n\nWait a second, in my earlier calculation, the distance to (1,6) is actually 1 step in X and 1 step in Y, so moving left to (1,5), then up to (1,6) makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6), then left to (1,6) is also fine.\n\nI need to decide which direction to take first.\n\nIf I move up to (2,6), then left to (1,6), I need to ensure that (2,6) is safe.\n\nSince snake 1 is at (4,6), moving to (2,6) should be safe, as long as snake 1 doesn't move left to (2,6).\n\nBut snake 1 is at (4,6), and if it moves left, it would go to (3,6), not (2,6). So, (2,6) should be safe.\n\nTherefore, both paths seem viable.\n\nPerhaps moving up to (2,6) first is slightly better, as it directly heads towards the apple.\n\nBut moving left to (1,5) also puts me in a position where I can move up to (1,6) without interference.\n\nI think moving left to (1,5) is a safer choice, as it distances me from snake 1, which is to my right.\n\nIf I move up to (2,6), I'm still relatively close to snake 1 at (4,6), and if it moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\nBy moving left, I create more space between snake 1 and myself.\n\nAdditionally, moving left to (1,5) doesn't put me in harm's way, and from there, moving up to (1,6) is straightforward.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think my best move right now is to move left to (1,5).\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best move for our snake in a multi-apple Snake game, considering the positions of apples and other snakes on the board. The goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, or ourselves.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions and Goals:**\n   - Our snake is at (2,5).\n   - Apples are at (1,6), (9,7), (7,0), (6,3), and (9,0).\n   - Enemy snake is at (4,7) with body at (4,6).\n   - We need to choose the next move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to optimally approach the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apple.\n   - (1,6) is closest with a distance of 2.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Determine the path to the closest apple at (1,6).\n   - Possible paths:\n     - Path 1: LEFT to (1,5), then UP to (1,6).\n     - Path 2: UP to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6).\n   - Consider the position of the enemy snake to choose the safer path.\n\n4. **Avoid Enemy Snake:**\n   - The enemy snake is at (4,7) with body at (4,6).\n   - Moving left initially distances us from the enemy, reducing the risk of collision.\n\n5. **Make the Decision:**\n   - Choose to move LEFT to (1,5) as the first step towards the apple at (1,6), avoiding potential interference from the enemy snake.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a turn-based decision and doesn't require coding game logic, the decision is made through reasoning. However, if we were to implement a decision-making function in code, it might look like this:\n\n```python\ndef decide_move(my_position, apple_positions, enemy_positions):\n    # Calculate the closest apple using Manhattan distance\n    closest_apple = min(apple_positions, key=lambda pos: abs(my_position[0] - pos"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I'm snake number 2, currently at position (1,6). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. There are multiple apples on the board: at (9,7), (7,0), (6,3), (9,0), and (0,8). There's also another snake, snake number 1, at (2,7), with its body at (3,7).\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Row 9: all dots, except possibly an apple at (9,7).\n\n- Row 8: an apple at (0,8).\n\n- Row 7: apples at (7,0) and (9,7), snake 1 at (2,7).\n\n- Row 6: me at (1,6), possibly an apple at (1,6)?\n\n- Row 5: my body at (1,5).\n\n- Row 4: empty.\n\n- Row 3: apple at (6,3).\n\n- Row 2: empty.\n\n- Row 1: empty.\n\n- Row 0: apples at (7,0) and (9,0).\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. Let's clarify the positions:\n\n- Apples are at (9,7), (7,0), (6,3), (9,0), and (0,8).\n\n- Snake 1 is at (2,7), with body at (3,7).\n\n- I am at (1,6), with body at (1,5).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the distances to each apple from my current position (1,6):\n\n1. (9,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: 9 - 1 = 8 steps to the right.\n\n- Vertical distance: 7 - 6 = 1 step up.\n\n- Total steps: 8 + 1 = 9 steps.\n\n2. (7,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: 7 - 1 = 6 steps to the right.\n\n- Vertical distance: 6 - 0 = 6 steps down.\n\n- Total steps: 6 + 6 = 12 steps.\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Horizontal distance: 6 - 1 = 5 steps to the right.\n\n- Vertical distance: 6 - 3 = 3 steps down.\n\n- Total steps: 5 + 3 = 8 steps.\n\n4. (9,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: 9 - 1 = 8 steps to the right.\n\n- Vertical distance: 6 - 0 = 6 steps down.\n\n- Total steps: 8 + 6 = 14 steps.\n\n5. (0,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: 1 - 0 = 1 step to the left.\n\n- Vertical distance: 6 - 8 = 2 steps up.\n\n- Total steps: 1 + 2 = 3 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,8), requiring only 3 steps: 1 left and 2 up.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if that path is blocked by other snakes or walls.\n\nCurrently, I'm at (1,6). Moving left to (0,6), then up to (0,7) and (0,8).\n\nIs (0,6) occupied by another snake? From the board description, it seems not, as snake 1 is at (2,7) and (3,7).\n\nSo, moving left to (0,6) is safe.\n\nThen, moving up to (0,7) and then to (0,8) should also be safe, as there are no other snakes in those positions.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,8), I will grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't immediately surround myself.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (0,6).\n\n2. Then, move up to (0,7).\n\n3. Then, move up to (0,8) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my body will be at (0,6), (1,6), and (1,5).\n\nNow, I need to plan beyond just getting one apple. I should think about which apple to go for next.\n\nAfter eating (0,8), the next closest apple might be (6,3) or (9,7).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (0,8):\n\n- (9,7):\n\n- Horizontal: 9 - 0 = 9 steps right.\n\n- Vertical: 7 - 8 = 1 step down.\n\n- Total: 9 + 1 = 10 steps.\n\n- (6,3):\n\n- Horizontal: 6 - 0 = 6 steps right.\n\n- Vertical: 3 - 8 = 5 steps down.\n\n- Total: 6 + 5 = 11 steps.\n\n- (9,0):\n\n- Horizontal: 9 - 0 = 9 steps right.\n\n- Vertical: 0 - 8 = 8 steps down.\n\n- Total: 9 + 8 = 17 steps.\n\n- (7,0):\n\n- Horizontal: 7 - 0 = 7 steps right.\n\n- Vertical: 0 - 8 = 8 steps down.\n\n- Total: 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\n- (9,7):\n\n- Horizontal: 9 - 0 = 9 steps right.\n\n- Vertical: 7 - 8 = 1 step down.\n\n- Total: 9 + 1 = 10 steps.\n\nSo, (9,7) is the next closest.\n\nBut moving to (9,7) would require moving right 9 steps and down 1 step.\n\nI need to consider if there are any obstacles in that path, like the other snake.\n\nCurrently, snake 1 is at (2,7) and (3,7). If I move right to (0,6) -> (1,6) -> ... -> (9,6), then up to (9,7), I might run into snake 1 if it moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (6,3) next.\n\nLet me think about another approach.\n\nMaybe I should aim for the apple at (9,7), but that's quite far, and I have to cross the board.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (7,0), which is at the bottom.\n\nFrom (0,8), moving down to (0,0), then right to (7,0).\n\nBut that would take 8 steps down and then 7 steps right, totaling 15 steps, which is more than going to (9,7).\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,0) is also at (7,0), and there's another apple at (9,0).\n\nIf I go down to (7,0), I might be able to pick up (9,0) on the way.\n\nWait, but (9,0) is further right.\n\nFrom (0,8), moving down to (0,0), then right to (9,0), then down to (9,7), but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider a different path.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI have multiple apples, and I need to prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nGiven that the apple at (0,8) is the closest, it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (0,8), I can reassess which apple to go for next.\n\nSo, for now, my plan is to move left to (0,6), then up to (0,7), then up to (0,8) to eat the apple.\n\nBut since I need to make only one move at a time, my immediate move should be to move left to (0,6).\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that moving left to (0,6) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, at (0,6), there are no other snakes, and it's within bounds.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I don't immediately box myself in.\n\nAfter moving left to (0,6), my body will be at (0,6) and (1,6), assuming I've grown after eating the apple at (1,6). Wait, actually, I need to correct that.\n\nWait a minute, in my last move information, it says I'm at (1,6), and I moved up from (1,5).
