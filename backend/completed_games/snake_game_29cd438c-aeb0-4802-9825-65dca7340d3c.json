This is safe for now.\n\n### Possible Moves from (6, 5):\n1. **UP to (6, 6)**: This would mean going back to my previous position, which is against the rules.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 4)**: This is safe but there is no apple at (6, 4).\n3. **LEFT to (5, 5)**: This is also safe and would not collect an apple either but allows more movement options next.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 5)**: This would move me into a space with no apple as well. \n\n### Apple Collection:\n- The apple at (5, 6) is the one I want to target as it's safe for me to reach with just one move.\n- Thus, I want to move **LEFT to (5, 6)** to pick up the apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter considering all my options, my best move right now is moving LEFT to (5, 6), which allows me to collect another apple while keeping me in a safe position.\n\n### My decided next move:\n**LEFT**"

It brings me closer to the apple at (7, 8) directly above.\n\n### Implications of Each Move\n- **UP (invalid) and DOWN (invalid)** make those moves out of the question.\n- **LEFT (4, 8)**: While safe, it keeps my options limited and does not progress towards the apples.\n- **RIGHT (6, 8)**: This move is promising as it allows me to get closer to the apple directly above at **(7, 8)**. Moreover, moving to (6, 8) keeps me away from the enemy snake, ensuring my safety.\n\nConsidering all of this, moving **RIGHT to (6, 8)** makes the most sense as it keeps me safe and aligns me closer to an apple.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nNext, I\u2019ll look to continue moving towards apples, particularly focusing on (7, 8) while being mindful of the enemy's movements. Staying clear of enemy snakes and aiming to grow and maximize points with each turn will be essential.\n\n### Decided Next Move\n**RIGHT**"

However, it doesn't directly approach any apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 8)**: \n   - This is also open and safe. It brings me closer to the apple at (7, 8) directly above.\n\n### Implications of Each Move\n- **UP (invalid) and DOWN (invalid)** make those moves out of the question.\n- **LEFT (4, 8)**: While safe, it keeps my options limited and does not progress towards the apples.\n- **RIGHT (6, 8)**: This move is promising as it allows me to get closer to the apple directly above at **(7, 8)**. Moreover, moving to (6, 8) keeps me away from the enemy snake, ensuring my safety.\n\nConsidering all of this, moving **RIGHT to (6, 8)** makes the most sense as it keeps me safe and aligns me closer to an apple.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nNext, I\u2019ll look to continue moving towards apples, particularly focusing on (7, 8) while being mindful of the enemy's movements.

However, moving UP might offer a potential longer-term route depending on what I do afterward.\n   - The apples at (5, 6) require navigating down and left, which seems to be more viable if I consider future moves.\n   - Moving close to the right edge towards the apple at (9, 6) could be an option but involves a more complex route.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Considerations**:\n   - The enemy snake is located at (7, 1). I need to be cautious and ensure I\u2019m not putting myself in a position where the enemy could easily block me or put me in jeopardy. \n\n4. **Strategizing Further**:\n   - After reviewing options, I find that moving UP is beneficial. This will allow me to evaluate subsequent moves more effectively. If I move UP to (7, 5), I can reassess my options for collecting apples on the following turn. \n\nOverall, maintaining flexibility is key. The movement UP seems the most benign and allows for further exploration of the board while I keep prioritizing the apple at (8, 1) and weighing my options around (5, 6).\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is:\n**UP**"

I must avoid getting too close.\n\n### Potential Moves Implications\n1. **Moving UP to (5, 8)**: \n   - This keeps options open and allows potential RIGHT movement next turn towards future apples. \n   - It's also completely safe and doesn't get me nearer to the enemy snake.\n\n2. **Moving LEFT to (4, 7)**: \n   - This move keeps me away from the enemy, but it leads me mostly on the same horizontal level as other apples.\n   - May limit my options in the next move and doesn't get closer to any specific target.\n\n3. **Moving RIGHT to (6, 7)**: \n   - This move is safe, but would not immediately position me closer to any apples.\n   - However, it gets me further from the enemy. \n\nThe best course of action seems to be moving UP to (5, 8). This will keep my options flexible without facing immediate danger from the enemy snake and ensuring I can't backtrack into my previous body. \n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving UP, I'll decide my next target based on potential locations of the apples, especially aiming to head towards (9, 6).\n- Continue monitoring movements of the enemy snake to ensure safe navigation and access to apples.\n\n### Decided Next Move\n**UP**"

However, it doesn't directly approach any apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 8)**: \n   - This is also open and safe. It brings me closer to the apple at (7, 8) directly above.\n\n### Implications of Each Move\n- **UP (invalid) and DOWN (invalid)** make those moves out of the question.\n- **LEFT (4, 8)**: While safe, it keeps my options limited and does not progress towards the apples.\n- **RIGHT (6, 8)**: This move is promising as it allows me to get closer to the apple directly above at **(7, 8)**. Moreover, moving to (6, 8) keeps me away from the enemy snake, ensuring my safety.\n\nConsidering all of this, moving **RIGHT to (6, 8)** makes the most sense as it keeps me safe and aligns me closer to an apple.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nNext, I\u2019ll look to continue moving towards apples, particularly focusing on (7, 8) while being mindful of the enemy's movements. Staying clear of enemy snakes and aiming to grow and maximize points with each turn will be essential.\n\n### Decided Next Move\n**RIGHT**"

It also keeps my options for movement open, allowing me to navigate around obstacles.\n- If I choose LEFT (to (6, 0)), although it is a legal move, it does not put me closer to any apples and might limit my choices in the next moves.\n\n### Future Game Plan\n- My goal is to head towards the apples while keeping a safe distance from my own body and the enemy snake. Moving UP to (7, 1) will allow me more room to strategize my next moves and aim for the nearby apples.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: UP. \n\nThis move will keep me in a favorable position to seek apples and maneuver around my snake's body and the enemy snake."

I must avoid getting too close.\n\n### Potential Moves Implications\n1. **Moving UP to (5, 8)**: \n   - This keeps options open and allows potential RIGHT movement next turn towards future apples. \n   - It's also completely safe and doesn't get me nearer to the enemy snake.\n\n2. **Moving LEFT to (4, 7)**: \n   - This move keeps me away from the enemy, but it leads me mostly on the same horizontal level as other apples.\n   - May limit my options in the next move and doesn't get closer to any specific target.\n\n3. **Moving RIGHT to (6, 7)**: \n   - This move is safe, but would not immediately position me closer to any apples.\n   - However, it gets me further from the enemy. \n\nThe best course of action seems to be moving UP to (5, 8). This will keep my options flexible without facing immediate danger from the enemy snake and ensuring I can't backtrack into my previous body. \n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving UP, I'll decide my next target based on potential locations of the apples, especially aiming to head towards (9, 6).\n- Continue monitoring movements of the enemy snake to ensure safe navigation and access to apples.\n\n### Decided Next Move\n**UP**"

However, it doesn't directly approach any apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 8)**: \n   - This is also open and safe. It brings me closer to the apple at (7, 8) directly above.\n\n### Implications of Each Move\n- **UP (invalid) and DOWN (invalid)** make those moves out of the question.\n- **LEFT (4, 8)**: While safe, it keeps my options limited and does not progress towards the apples.\n- **RIGHT (6, 8)**: This move is promising as it allows me to get closer to the apple directly above at **(7, 8)**. Moreover, moving to (6, 8) keeps me away from the enemy snake, ensuring my safety.\n\nConsidering all of this, moving **RIGHT to (6, 8)** makes the most sense as it keeps me safe and aligns me closer to an apple.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nNext, I\u2019ll look to continue moving towards apples, particularly focusing on (7, 8) while being mindful of the enemy's movements. Staying clear of enemy snakes and aiming to grow and maximize points with each turn will be essential.\n\n### Decided Next Move\n**RIGHT**"

Moving up keeps me safe and gives access to more options in following turns.\n- **Move LEFT to (6, 0)**: While it\u2019s an open position, it leads away from my nearest targets (the apples at (3, 2) and (3, 4)). It could also place me in a more confined space for future moves.\n\n### Strategic Evaluation\n- Moving UP to (7, 1) allows me to potentially head towards the apples located farther up the board. It also keeps my options for movement open, allowing me to navigate around obstacles.\n- If I choose LEFT (to (6, 0)), although it is a legal move, it does not put me closer to any apples and might limit my choices in the next moves.\n\n### Future Game Plan\n- My goal is to head towards the apples while keeping a safe distance from my own body and the enemy snake. Moving UP to (7, 1) will allow me more room to strategize my next moves and aim for the nearby apples.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: UP. \n\nThis move will keep me in a favorable position to seek apples and maneuver around my snake's body and the enemy snake."
