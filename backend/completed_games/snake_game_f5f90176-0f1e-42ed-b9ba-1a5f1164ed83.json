It's risky as they could also move next.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Consideration**:\n   - The enemy snake is located at (9, 6) and could potentially move toward (8, 6) if I don't act quickly. However, since I will collect the apple on this turn, this risk is somewhat mitigated.\n\n4. **Strategic Decisions**:\n   - The most advantageous move right now would be to go DOWN to (8, 6) to collect the apple, thus scoring a point. After that, I need to reassess my options for subsequent turns, particularly avoiding confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\n### Future Strategy:\nAfter collecting the apple and growing:\n- I should prioritize moving away from the enemy and seek the remaining apples, particularly those closer to my current position while ensuring I\u2019m not cornered by the enemy snake.\n\nBased on this analysis, my decided next move is **DOWN**."
