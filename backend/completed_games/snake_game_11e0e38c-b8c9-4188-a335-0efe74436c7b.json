Could go DOWN to start path to apples at bottom\n\nDecision making:\nI think changing my strategy might be wise here. While the apple at (3, 5) is closest horizontally, the enemy snake at (1, 5) makes that path risky. \n\nThe apple at (8, 7) is actually quite accessible by going UP two spaces and RIGHT one space. This seems like the safest and most efficient path to an apple right now.\n\nNext turn reminder: If I go UP now, I should plan to go UP again next turn, then RIGHT to reach the apple at (8, 7).\n\nI choose: UP"
