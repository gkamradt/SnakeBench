I'm currently in the top right corner, which limits my movement options.\n2. The closest apple appears to be at (3, 8), which is up and to the left.\n3. Enemy snake #1 is at (5, 5), which is not an immediate threat.\n4. I need to navigate carefully to avoid walls and potential snake collisions.\n\nThought Process:\n- Moving UP towards (3, 8) seems like the most strategic initial move.\n- It allows me to potentially collect an apple and move away from the corner.\n- It doesn't risk immediate collision with the enemy snake.\n\nNext Turn Strategy: Continue moving towards the apples while maintaining board awareness and avoiding potential collisions.\n\nDecided Next Move: UP"
