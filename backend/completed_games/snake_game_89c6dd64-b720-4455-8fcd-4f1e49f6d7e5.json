Assess the direct path for obstacles or changes in the game state.\n- Monitor the enemy snake's position, although currently it's far from my direct path and poses no conflict.\n- Prioritize safety by avoiding running into myself or the edges of the board.\n\nNext Tactical Reminder:\n- Keep assessing the most reliable route to gain apples and keep track of the enemy movement to foresee any potential blockages or threats.\n\n**Next move: DOWN** to continue to row 6, aligning optimally with multiple target apples."

Moving right is also safe and gets me closer to the apple at (9, 0).  I need to calculate the distances to each apple. (0, 0) is closer than (9, 0).

If no apples are directly in front, move in a safe direction, prioritizing open paths and avoiding collisions with walls and other snakes.  If multiple safe directions exist, choose the direction that moves me closer to an apple.  Keep track of the positions of apples and enemy snakes.  Crucially, start calculating potential future positions of enemy snakes to anticipate potential collisions.  Also, start considering my own future positions to avoid collisions with my own tail.  Be more aggressive in pursuing apples.  Calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple and prioritize the closest one.  This turn, I need to be more proactive in avoiding collisions with my own tail.  Also, consider the possibility of enemy snakes blocking my path.  If there are no safe moves, consider a random move.
