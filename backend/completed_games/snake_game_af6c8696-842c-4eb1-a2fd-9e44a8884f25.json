Move UP from (6, 5) to (6, 6) to get closer to (5, 9).\n2. In subsequent moves, decide between continuing UP or moving LEFT based on the game progress and threats from the enemy snake which is currently at (8, 6).\n\nRisks:\n- Snake #2 at (8, 6) is closer to the apple at (8, 8), which means I should monitor movements to avoid clashing.\n- Since Snake #2's body isn't listed, it implies it has just its head, reducing the likelihood of immediate collisions, especially with distance.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Since I am close to multiple apples at the top, each move should be about maximizing access to multiple apples while considering safety escape paths and future positioning after collecting each apple.\n\nNext turn strategy:\n- After moving to (6, 6), evaluate whether moving UP to (6, 7) is safe and beneficial or if a strategic move LEFT or RIGHT to adjust alignment with an apple is advisable.\n\nDecided next move: UP.\nThis move aims to get closer vertically to both (5, 9) and (3, 7) giving options for subsequent turns."

To get there, I could continue moving UP and then LEFT.\n- Another apple close by at (3, 7) can be approached if I move left from (5, 9).\n- Enemy snake #2 is located at (8, 7) and has no listed body, meaning less risk of blocking but could compete for the apple (8, 8) if it moves to the right.\n\nStrategy Evaluation:\n1. Continuing UP from (6, 6) makes a strategic move towards (5, 9). I will be one column off on the x-coordinate but directly below this apple if I am at (6, 7).\n2. As my next move from (6, 6) to (6, 7), this position allows me flexibility to either go UP again to (6, 8), closer to a target apple or LEFT to (5, 7) depending on the enemy's movements and closer alignment to the apple at (5, 9).\n\nFollowing this trajectory:\n- If no unforeseen changes occur next round (e.g., the enemy quite far from my current path), a continued UP move allows direct route to (6, 8) lying under (5, 9), which can be my subsequent move. This would be UP and then LEFT for positioning to eat the apple.\n  \nRisk Management:\n- Continuously observe enemy snake, since its movement towards the apple (8, 8) might indicate future conflicting paths.\n  \nDecided next move based on the current logic: UP.\n\n\"Next turn strategy\": After moving UP to (6, 7), evaluate the enemy position and decide to either go UP directly toward (6, 8) or position LEFT towards (5, 7), aiming to capture the apple at (5, 9). Ensure vicinity remains clear of enemy interference and avoid any risky maneuvers that might endanger my snake or lead to collision."

It's near the top right corner of the board which currently poses no direct threat to my planned path unless it decides to move leftwards.\n\n3. **Immediate Path Forward**:\n   - Moving UP to (5, 8) is the most logical next step. This move positions me a step closer to the apple at (5, 9) enhancing the probability to grow my snake without encountering immediate hindrances. The enemy snake is likely too far to contest the apple at (5, 9) in the next few moves.\n\n4. **Risks and Considerations**:\n   - Ensure that every move keeps my snake within the safe confines of the board limits and away from any segment of my body or the enemy snake.\n\n5. **Future Strategic Advice**:\n   - Upon reaching (5, 9) and presumably consuming the apple there, assess the board for the next closest apple which might be at (3,7), needing a strategic shift down and left (considering no other snake heads towards it).\n\n6. **Plan after Next Apple**:\n   - The upcoming moves should be calculated based on enemy snake movements and potential new apple positions.
