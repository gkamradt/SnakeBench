The enemy snake 1 is at (7,4) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to go. Since I'm at (1,9), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP from (1,9) would take me to (1,10), which is outside the board (since y ranges up to 9). So UP is a wall, which would kill me. Can't go UP.\n\nDOWN would be to (1,8). That's within the board. No snakes or apples there. Safe.\n\nLEFT from (1,9) is (0,9). Also within the board. No apples there. Safe.\n\nRIGHT is (2,9). Also safe. But looking at apples, the closest ones are (3,9) which is two steps to the right. If I go RIGHT twice, I can get that apple. But maybe I should check other apples too.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,9) is in the same row as my current position. So if I go RIGHT twice, I can reach it. But first, moving RIGHT once to (2,9), then again to (3,9) which has an apple. That would make me grow. But I need to make sure that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,2) is below me. From (1,9), moving DOWN multiple times. But that's a longer path. Let's see: (1,9) \u2192 (1,8) \u2192 (1,7)... down to (1,2). That's 7 moves down. But maybe there's a quicker way. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nThe apple at (4,0) is at the bottom. To get there, I need to go left and down. From (1,9), moving left to (0,9), then down. But that's a long way. The apple at (4,1) is also in the lower area. But again, maybe not the closest.\n\nThe apple at (7,5) is near the enemy snake. Snake 1 is at (7,4). So if I go towards (7,5), I might collide with snake 1. Probably better to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo the closest apples are (3,9) and (1,2). Let's prioritize (3,9) since it's two steps right. But first, I need to move RIGHT once to (2,9), then again to (3,9). But since the snake's body is empty, moving right is safe. However, the enemy snake is at (7,4), which is far from that area. So maybe that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (1,8) and then towards (1,2) could be another path. But that's a longer journey. But maybe safer? Let's check possible risks.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, to (2,9), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (3,9) and eat the apple. That gives me a point and grows my body. But after that, I need to avoid colliding with my own body. But since I have no body yet, that's not an issue. So that's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (0,9) might be a way to explore other areas, but there's no apple there. So probably not as beneficial.\n\nSo the best move seems to be RIGHT towards the apple at (3,9). But wait, the current position is (1,9). Moving RIGHT once takes me to (2,9). Then next move, RIGHT again to (3,9) which is the apple. So that's two moves. But since the enemy snake is at (7,4), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. So moving RIGHT now is safe.\n\nWait, but what about the enemy snake? They are at (7,4). Are they moving towards any apples? The apple at (7,5) is right above them. So snake 1 might move UP to (7,5) to get that apple. But that's their problem. For me, focusing on the closest apple.\n\nSo the immediate move should be RIGHT to (2,9). Then next turn, RIGHT again to (3,9) to eat the apple. That's a solid plan. Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, I can start moving towards (1,2), but that's a longer path. But maybe there's another apple on the way. Let me check the apples again.\n\nApples at (4,1), (4,0), (3,9), (1,2), (7,5). So (1,2) is in column 1, row 2. From (1,9), moving down 7 times. That's a lot. But maybe if I can get that apple, but it's a longer path and riskier. The apple at (3,9) is much closer.\n\nSo the best option is to go RIGHT now. So the direction is RIGHT. That's the first step towards the apple at (3,9). Then next turn, I can go RIGHT again to get it. That's the plan.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The other apples are further away, so focusing on the closest one makes sense.\n\nPossible moves from (2,9) are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1).

That's the apple. Eating it would grow my body, which is good.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (3,9) to eat the apple. No risks here since there's no enemy nearby and my body is empty.
