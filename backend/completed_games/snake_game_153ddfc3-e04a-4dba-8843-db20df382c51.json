Move right to (6, 9) and then down to (6, 7) and then right to (7, 7) to collect the apple at (1, 4)\n\nHowever, moving right or down would bring me closer to snake #2, which is risky. So, I'll choose to minimize the risk by moving up to collect the apple at (3, 6).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to avoid snake #2 and collect as many apples as possible while maintaining a safe distance from other snakes and walls.\n\nNext move: UP"

The closest apple is at (3, 0), which is directly below the snake. However, moving down would put the snake in a vulnerable position, as it would be directly below another apple at (2, 0), which could potentially be taken by an enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy would be to move towards the apple at (3, 3), which is directly above the snake. This would not only give the snake a point, but also position it in a way that it could easily move towards the apple at (3, 6) in the next turn.\n\nSo, the next move should be: UP\n\nNext turn strategy: Move towards the apple at (3, 6)."
