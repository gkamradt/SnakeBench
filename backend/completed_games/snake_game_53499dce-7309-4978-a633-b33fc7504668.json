Once I reach (7, 7), I'll gain a point, making my current position (7, 7). After grabbing that apple, I will then need to assess my future moves based on my new position.\n\nAfter reaching (7, 7), I'll have to check the surrounding area:\n- To the left (6, 7): an open square.\n- Below (7, 6): also an open square.\n- Above (7, 8): an open square.\n- To the right (8, 7): there is nothing.\n\nThe most immediate next step after that would be to either move left to (6, 7) or down to (7, 6). Both moves offer safety as they are away from walls and the enemy snake. My focus will remain on other apples; (8, 0) and (7, 5) will still be targets in the long run.\n\nOverall, moving UP now is both productive and strategically sound. \n\nSo, I will proceed with my move now:\n\n**Next move: UP.**"
