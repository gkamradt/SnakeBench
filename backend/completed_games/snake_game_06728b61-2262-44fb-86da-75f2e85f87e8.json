            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,1). There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)? Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your body extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you move forward, your tail stays in place unless you're growing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move on that turn, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my tail stays where it was, and my snake grows by one segment?\n\nWait, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays stationary, and your head moves to the new position, and then on the next move, your tail moves forward, but since you've grown, the tail remains in its previous position.\n\nWait, I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me assume that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,1). There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)? Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you eat an apple, your tail stays in place unless you're moving forward.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it was, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). So, that's row 3, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (3,7), (7,6), and (9,4).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,8), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 4| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 2. That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . . (Apple at 3,7)\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . . (Apple at 7,6)\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A (Apple at 9,4)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . 2 . (Me at 8,3)\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . T . (Apple at 1,2, and something at 8,2?)\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . . (Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)? Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your body extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you move forward, your tail stays in place unless you're growing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move on that turn, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my tail stays where it was, and my snake grows by one segment?\n\nWait, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays stationary, and your head moves to the new position, and then on the next move, your tail moves forward, but since you've grown, the tail remains in its previous position.\n\nWait, I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me assume that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)? Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your snake extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you eat an apple, your tail stays in place unless you're moving forward.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it was, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). So, that's row 3, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (3,7), (7,6), and (9,4).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,8), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 4| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 2. That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . . (Apple at 3,7)\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . . (Apple at 7,6)\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A (Apple at 9,4)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . 2 . (Me at 8,3)\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . T . (Apple at 1,2, and something at 8,2?)\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . . (Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: .

So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)? Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your body extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you move forward, your tail stays in place unless you're growing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move on that turn, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my tail stays where it was, and my snake grows by one segment?\n\nWait, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays stationary, and your head moves to the new position, and then on the next move, your tail moves forward, but since you've grown, the tail remains in its previous position.\n\nWait, I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me assume that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). So, that's row 3, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (3,7), (7,6), and (9,4).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,8), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 4| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 2. That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . . (Apple at 3,7)\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . . (Apple at 7,6)\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A (Apple at 9,4)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . 2 .

(Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). So, that's row 4, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (9,4), and (8,9).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 2 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 4| = 0\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 0 = 1\n\n5. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 8| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 1. That means it's just one step to the right from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . 2 A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, it seems like the apple at (9,4) is right next to me, at (9,4).\n\nSo, moving right to (9,4) would allow me to eat it immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about what's beyond that position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or leave myself with nowhere to go.\n\nAlso, I should consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,4), so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (9,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll be at (9,4), and I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (5,0): bottom middle\n\n- (1,2): lower left\n\n- (7,6): upper middle\n\n- (8,9): top right\n\nI should think about which one to target next.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is straight up from my current position, just four moves up to (8,8), then one more up to (8,9).\n\nBut, there might be obstacles or the enemy snake might be moving.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,6) is left and up.\n\nBut, the apple at (5,0) is down and left, which is quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim for (8,9) next, since it's in line with my current position.\n\nBut first things first, I need to move to (9,4).\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is straightforward.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll need to decide whether to move up towards (8,9) or left towards (7,6).\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move left to (8,4)\n\n- Move up to (8,5)\n\n- Continue up to (8,9)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move up to (9,5)\n\n- Then what? There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4).

That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (9,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n2.

Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 7| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4.

Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 8| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 4. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4. Move left to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating it, I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can consider my next target.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nI need to make sure that moving up to (9,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,7), which is row 7, column 2, with a body part at (3,7).\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (7,6), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is to go UP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your body extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you move forward, your tail stays in place unless you're growing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move on that turn, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my tail stays where it was, and my snake grows by one segment?\n\nWait, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays stationary, and your head moves to the new position, and then on the next move, your tail moves forward, but since you've grown, the tail remains in its previous position.\n\nWait, I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me assume that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). So, that's row 3, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (3,7), (7,6), and (9,4).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,8), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 4| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 2. That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

(Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

So, that's row 4, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (9,4), and (8,9).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 2 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 4| = 0\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 0 = 1\n\n5. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 8| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 1. That means it's just one step to the right from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . 2 A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, it seems like the apple at (9,4) is right next to me, at (9,4).\n\nSo, moving right to (9,4) would allow me to eat it immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about what's beyond that position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or leave myself with nowhere to go.\n\nAlso, I should consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,4), so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (9,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll be at (9,4), and I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (5,0): bottom middle\n\n- (1,2): lower left\n\n- (7,6): upper middle\n\n- (8,9): top right\n\nI should think about which one to target next.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is straight up from my current position, just four moves up to (8,8), then one more up to (8,9).\n\nBut, there might be obstacles or the enemy snake might be moving.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,6) is left and up.\n\nBut, the apple at (5,0) is down and left, which is quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim for (8,9) next, since it's in line with my current position.\n\nBut first things first, I need to move to (9,4).\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is straightforward.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll need to decide whether to move up towards (8,9) or left towards (7,6).\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move left to (8,4)\n\n- Move up to (8,5)\n\n- Continue up to (8,9)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move up to (9,5)\n\n- Then what? There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 1| = 8\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 7| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 8| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 4. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4. Move left to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating it, I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can consider my next target.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nI need to make sure that moving up to (9,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,7), which is row 7, column 2, with a body part at (3,7).\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (7,6), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is to go UP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your body extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you move forward, your tail stays in place unless you're growing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move on that turn, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my tail stays where it was, and my snake grows by one segment?\n\nWait, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays stationary, and your head moves to the new position, and then on the next move, your tail moves forward, but since you've grown, the tail remains in its previous position.\n\nWait, I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me assume that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). So, that's row 3, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (3,7), (7,6), and (9,4).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,8), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 4| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 2. That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . . (Apple at 3,7)\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . . (Apple at 7,6)\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A (Apple at 9,4)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . 2 .

(Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). So, that's row 4, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (9,4), and (8,9).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 2 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 4| = 0\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 0 = 1\n\n5. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 8| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 1. That means it's just one step to the right from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . 2 A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, it seems like the apple at (9,4) is right next to me, at (9,4).\n\nSo, moving right to (9,4) would allow me to eat it immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about what's beyond that position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or leave myself with nowhere to go.\n\nAlso, I should consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,4), so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (9,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll be at (9,4), and I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (5,0): bottom middle\n\n- (1,2): lower left\n\n- (7,6): upper middle\n\n- (8,9): top right\n\nI should think about which one to target next.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is straight up from my current position, just four moves up to (8,8), then one more up to (8,9).\n\nBut, there might be obstacles or the enemy snake might be moving.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,6) is left and up.\n\nBut, the apple at (5,0) is down and left, which is quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim for (8,9) next, since it's in line with my current position.\n\nBut first things first, I need to move to (9,4).\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is straightforward.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll need to decide whether to move up towards (8,9) or left towards (7,6).\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move left to (8,4)\n\n- Move up to (8,5)\n\n- Continue up to (8,9)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move up to (9,5)\n\n- Then what? There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 7| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4.

Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 8| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 4. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4. Move left to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating it, I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can consider my next target.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nI need to make sure that moving up to (9,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,7), which is row 7, column 2, with a body part at (3,7).\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (7,6), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is to go UP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)? Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your body extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you move forward, your tail stays in place unless you're growing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move on that turn, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my tail stays where it was, and my snake grows by one segment?\n\nWait, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays stationary, and your head moves to the new position, and then on the next move, your tail moves forward, but since you've grown, the tail remains in its previous position.\n\nWait, I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me assume that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). So, that's row 3, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (3,7), (7,6), and (9,4).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,8), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 4| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 2. That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . . (Apple at 3,7)\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . . (Apple at 7,6)\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A (Apple at 9,4)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . 2 .

(Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). So, that's row 4, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (9,4), and (8,9).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 2 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 4| = 0\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 0 = 1\n\n5. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 8| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 1. That means it's just one step to the right from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . 2 A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, it seems like the apple at (9,4) is right next to me, at (9,4).\n\nSo, moving right to (9,4) would allow me to eat it immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about what's beyond that position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or leave myself with nowhere to go.\n\nAlso, I should consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,4), so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (9,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll be at (9,4), and I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (5,0): bottom middle\n\n- (1,2): lower left\n\n- (7,6): upper middle\n\n- (8,9): top right\n\nI should think about which one to target next.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is straight up from my current position, just four moves up to (8,8), then one more up to (8,9).\n\nBut, there might be obstacles or the enemy snake might be moving.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,6) is left and up.\n\nBut, the apple at (5,0) is down and left, which is quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim for (8,9) next, since it's in line with my current position.\n\nBut first things first, I need to move to (9,4).\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is straightforward.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll need to decide whether to move up towards (8,9) or left towards (7,6).\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move left to (8,4)\n\n- Move up to (8,5)\n\n- Continue up to (8,9)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move up to (9,5)\n\n- Then what? There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4.

Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (7,5), moving up to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving up to (7,6):\n\n- Is (7,6) empty? From the board, it's marked as having an apple.\n\n- So, it's safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into a wall or myself.\n\nLet's think about where I can go after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nFrom (7,6), I could:\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move left to (6,6)\n\n- Move right to (8,6)\n\n- Move down to (7,5)\n\nBut moving down to (7,5) would be risky because that's where I came from, and I need to make sure I don't get boxed in.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If I move up to (7,7), is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (7,7), I could continue up to (7,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,6):\n\n- Is (6,6) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (6,6), I could move left to (5,6), up to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, both directions seem viable after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples.\n\nThe apple at (5,8) is relatively close, with a distance of 5 from my current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,6), moving to (5,8) would involve moving left to (6,6), then up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), then up to (5,8).\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,9) is also an option, but it's a bit farther.\n\nFrom (7,6), moving right to (8,6), then up to (8,7), (8,8), and (8,9).\n\nBut that's a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (1,5) with a body part at (1,6).\n\nThat's quite far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take, so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nFor now, since the apple at (7,6) is right next to me and the path is clear, I think moving up to it is the best choice.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, I see that the apple is at (7,6), which is up from my current position at (7,5).\n\nSo, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nBut in the last move information, it says the direction was LEFT, which would be moving from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nWait, in the board, positions are listed with Y coordinates starting from 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 is at the top.\n\nIn the board diagram:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . . A .\n\n 8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . T . . . . . A . .\n\n 5 . 1 . . . . . 2 T T\n\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 2 .

A . . . .\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,5), which is column 7, row 5.\n\nThe apple is at (7,6), which is column 7, row 6, so that's upwards from my current position.\n\nBut in the last move, it says direction: LEFT, from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nWait, but moving left from (7,5) is to (6,5), which is to the left, decreasing X coordinate.\n\nBut the apple is at (7,6), which is upwards, increasing Y coordinate.\n\nI think there might be some confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps there are multiple snakes, and snake 2 is at (7,5), but the board shows snake 2 at (8,5) and (8,6).\n\nWait, in the board:\n\nRow 5: . 1 . . . . . 2 T T\n\nColumn 7: . . . . . . . .\n\nColumn 8: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nWait, perhaps I need to double-check the positions.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nAt row 5, column 7: 2 T T\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (8,6).\n\nWait, but the description says snake 2 is at (7,5).\n\nWait, perhaps there's a discrepancy between the board representation and the coordinate system.\n\nIn the board, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, position (7,5) is column 7, row 5.\n\nBut in the board, it shows snake 2 at columns 7 and 8, row 5.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: . 1 . . . . . 2 T T\n\nAssuming columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, column 7 has '2', column 8 has 'T', column 9 has 'T'.\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (9,5).\n\nWait, but the description says snake 2 is at (7,5).\n\nPerhaps the 'T' represents the tail.\n\nSo, snake 2 is mainly at (7,5), with tail at (8,5) and (9,5).\n\nWait, no, in snake games, 'T' usually stands for the tail.\n\nSo, perhaps snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (9,5), with head at (7,5).\n\nBut the apple is at (7,6), which is directly above the head.\n\nSo, to move up from (7,5) to (7,6), which is increasing Y coordinate.\n\nBut in the last move, it says direction: LEFT, which would be to (6,5).\n\nI think there might be a confusion in understanding the coordinate system or the board layout.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that moving up increases the Y coordinate, and moving right increases the X coordinate.\n\nGiven that, moving up from (7,"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)?

I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)?

That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5.

That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

(Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4). So, that's row 4, column 9.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (8,9), and (5,8).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (9,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 1| = 8\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 7| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 8| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 4. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4. Move left to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating it, I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can consider my next target.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nI need to make sure that moving up to (9,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,7), which is row 7, column 2, with a body part at (3,7).\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (7,6), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is to go UP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 0| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 5 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 1| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 2| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 7| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 6| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 9| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 4 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 8| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 3 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 1. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (7,5), moving up to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving up to (7,6):\n\n- Is (7,6) empty? From the board, it's marked as having an apple.\n\n- So, it's safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into a wall or myself.\n\nLet's think about where I can go after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nFrom (7,6), I could:\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move left to (6,6)\n\n- Move right to (8,6)\n\n- Move down to (7,5)\n\nBut moving down to (7,5) would be risky because that's where I came from, and I need to make sure I don't get boxed in.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If I move up to (7,7), is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (7,7), I could continue up to (7,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,6):\n\n- Is (6,6) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (6,6), I could move left to (5,6), up to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, both directions seem viable after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples.\n\nThe apple at (5,8) is relatively close, with a distance of 5 from my current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,6), moving to (5,8) would involve moving left to (6,6), then up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), then up to (5,8).\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,9) is also an option, but it's a bit farther.\n\nFrom (7,6), moving right to (8,6), then up to (8,7), (8,8), and (8,9).\n\nBut that's a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (1,5) with a body part at (1,6).\n\nThat's quite far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take, so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nFor now, since the apple at (7,6) is right next to me and the path is clear, I think moving up to it is the best choice.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, I see that the apple is at (7,6), which is up from my current position at (7,5).\n\nSo, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nBut in the last move information, it says the direction was LEFT, which would be moving from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nWait, in the board, positions are listed with Y coordinates starting from 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 is at the top.\n\nIn the board diagram:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . .

A . . . .\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,5), which is column 7, row 5.\n\nThe apple is at (7,6), which is column 7, row 6, so that's upwards from my current position.\n\nBut in the last move, it says direction: LEFT, from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nWait, but moving left from (7,5) is to (6,5), which is to the left, decreasing X coordinate.\n\nBut the apple is at (7,6), which is upwards, increasing Y coordinate.\n\nI think there might be some confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps there are multiple snakes, and snake 2 is at (7,5), but the board shows snake 2 at (8,5) and (8,6).\n\nWait, in the board:\n\nRow 5: . 1 . . . . . 2 T T\n\nColumn 7: . . . . . . . .\n\nColumn 8: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nWait, perhaps I need to double-check the positions.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nAt row 5, column 7: 2 T T\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (8,6).\n\nWait, but the description says snake 2 is at (7,5).\n\nWait, perhaps there's a discrepancy between the board representation and the coordinate system.\n\nIn the board, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, position (7,5) is column 7, row 5.\n\nBut in the board, it shows snake 2 at columns 7 and 8, row 5.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: . 1 . . . . . 2 T T\n\nAssuming columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, column 7 has '2', column 8 has 'T', column 9 has 'T'.\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (9,5).\n\nWait, but the description says snake 2 is at (7,5).\n\nPerhaps the 'T' represents the tail.\n\nSo, snake 2 is mainly at (7,5), with tail at (8,5) and (9,5).\n\nWait, no, in snake games, 'T' usually stands for the tail.\n\nSo, perhaps snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (9,5), with head at (7,5).\n\nBut the apple is at (7,6), which is directly above the head.\n\nSo, to move up from (7,5) to (7,6), which is increasing Y coordinate.\n\nBut in the last move, it says direction: LEFT, which would be to (6,5).\n\nI think there might be a confusion in understanding the coordinate system or the board layout.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that moving up increases the Y coordinate, and moving right increases the X coordinate.\n\nGiven that, moving up from (7,"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)?

I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)?

That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5.

That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

(Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4). So, that's row 4, column 9.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (8,9), and (5,8).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (9,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 1| = 8\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 7| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 8| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 4. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4. Move left to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating it, I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can consider my next target.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nI need to make sure that moving up to (9,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,7), which is row 7, column 2, with a body part at (3,7).\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (7,6), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is to go UP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 0| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 5 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 1| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 2| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 7| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 6| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 9| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 4 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 8| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 3 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 1. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (7,5), moving up to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving up to (7,6):\n\n- Is (7,6) empty? From the board, it's marked as having an apple.\n\n- So, it's safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into a wall or myself.\n\nLet's think about where I can go after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nFrom (7,6), I could:\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move left to (6,6)\n\n- Move right to (8,6)\n\n- Move down to (7,5)\n\nBut moving down to (7,5) would be risky because that's where I came from, and I need to make sure I don't get boxed in.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If I move up to (7,7), is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (7,7), I could continue up to (7,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,6):\n\n- Is (6,6) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (6,6), I could move left to (5,6), up to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, both directions seem viable after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples.\n\nThe apple at (5,8) is relatively close, with a distance of 5 from my current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,6), moving to (5,8) would involve moving left to (6,6), then up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), then up to (5,8).\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,9) is also an option, but it's a bit farther.\n\nFrom (7,6), moving right to (8,6), then up to (8,7), (8,8), and (8,9).\n\nBut that's a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (1,5) with a body part at (1,6).\n\nThat's quite far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take, so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nFor now, since the apple at (7,6) is right next to me and the path is clear, I think moving up to it is the best choice.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, I see that the apple is at (7,6), which is up from my current position at (7,5).\n\nSo, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nBut in the last move information, it says the direction was LEFT, which would be moving from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nWait, in the board, positions are listed with Y coordinates starting from 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 is at the top.\n\nIn the board diagram:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . .

A . . . .\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,5), which is column 7, row 5.\n\nThe apple is at (7,6), which is column 7, row 6, so that's upwards from my current position.\n\nBut in the last move, it says direction: LEFT, from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nWait, but moving left from (7,5) is to (6,5), which is to the left, decreasing X coordinate.\n\nBut the apple is at (7,6), which is upwards, increasing Y coordinate.\n\nI think there might be some confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps there are multiple snakes, and snake 2 is at (7,5), but the board shows snake 2 at (8,5) and (8,6).\n\nWait, in the board:\n\nRow 5: . 1 . . . . . 2 T T\n\nColumn 7: . . . . . . . .\n\nColumn 8: . . . . .

Yes, as per earlier.\n\nSo, multiple options after eating the apple.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (1,3) with a body at (1,4).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nGiven that it's at (1,3) and has a body at (1,4), it's relatively far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting to (5,8).\n\nBut let's also consider the apple at (8,9), which is also at a distance of 3.\n\nFrom (7,7), to get to (8,9):\n\n- Move right to (8,7)\n\n- Move up to (8,8)\n\n- Move up to (8,9)\n\nThat's also a path of three moves.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (8,7): Is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,8): Is it empty?

Yes.\n\n- After moving to (6,7), my tail will move from (8,7) to (7,7), assuming I have a body part at (8,7).\n\nWait, but in the board, snake 2 is at (7,7), with body at (8,7) and perhaps another part.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n7 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nAssuming that '2' is the head, and 'T' is the tail.\n\nBut in the description, snake 2 is at (7,7), with body at [(8,7)].\n\nWait, perhaps snake 2 is made up of (7,7), (8,7), and (8,6).\n\nFrom the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . T . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,7), (8,7), and (8,6).\n\nTherefore, if I move left from (7,7) to (6,7), my tail will move from (8,7) to (7,7).\n\nBut (7,7) is occupied by my head, which is moving to (6,7).\n\nWait, no, in snake games, when you move, the tail moves to where the head was previously.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,7) to (6,7), the body part at (8,7) will move to (7,7), and the tail at (8,6) will move to (8,7).\n\nSo, after the move:\n\n- Head: (6,7)\n\n- Body: (7,7), (8,7)\n\n- Tail: (8,6)\n\nThis seems fine, as none of these positions overlap.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (6,7) is safe.\n\nNext, from (6,7), I'll move left again to (5,7), then up to (5,8) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in each step, the path is clear and I don't run into anything.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any apples closer than (5,8).\n\nWait, looking back, there's an apple at (5,8), which is two moves away, and another apple at (8,9), which is also two moves away.\n\nBut (5,8) is closer in terms of vertical distance, as it's only one up from (5,7), whereas (8,9) is one right and two up from (7,7).\n\nPerhaps I should consider which path is safer or which leads me closer to more apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (8,9) first,"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)? Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your body extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you move forward, your tail stays in place unless you're growing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move on that turn, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my tail stays where it was, and my snake grows by one segment?\n\nWait, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays stationary, and your head moves to the new position, and then on the next move, your tail moves forward, but since you've grown, the tail remains in its previous position.\n\nWait, I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me assume that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). So, that's row 3, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (3,7), (7,6), and (9,4).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,8), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 4| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 2. That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . . (Apple at 3,7)\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . . (Apple at 7,6)\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A (Apple at 9,4)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . 2 . (Me at 8,3)\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . T . (Apple at 1,2, and something at 8,2?)\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . . (Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). So, that's row 4, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (9,4), and (8,9).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 2 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 4| = 0\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 0 = 1\n\n5. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 8| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 1. That means it's just one step to the right from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . 2 A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, it seems like the apple at (9,4) is right next to me, at (9,4).\n\nSo, moving right to (9,4) would allow me to eat it immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about what's beyond that position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or leave myself with nowhere to go.\n\nAlso, I should consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,4), so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (9,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll be at (9,4), and I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (5,0): bottom middle\n\n- (1,2): lower left\n\n- (7,6): upper middle\n\n- (8,9): top right\n\nI should think about which one to target next.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is straight up from my current position, just four moves up to (8,8), then one more up to (8,9).\n\nBut, there might be obstacles or the enemy snake might be moving.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,6) is left and up.\n\nBut, the apple at (5,0) is down and left, which is quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim for (8,9) next, since it's in line with my current position.\n\nBut first things first, I need to move to (9,4).\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is straightforward.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll need to decide whether to move up towards (8,9) or left towards (7,6).\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move left to (8,4)\n\n- Move up to (8,5)\n\n- Continue up to (8,9)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move up to (9,5)\n\n- Then what? There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4. Move left to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating it, I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can consider my next target.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nI need to make sure that moving up to (9,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,7), which is row 7, column 2, with a body part at (3,7).\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (7,6), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is to go UP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,5). So, that's row 5, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (8,9), and (5,8).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (1,6), with a body part at (2,6).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,5).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 0| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 5 = 8\n\n2.

Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 6| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 8| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 9| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 4 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 8| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 2. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (8,5), moving left to (7,5)\n\n- Then up to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (7,5):\n\n- Is (7,5) empty? From the board, it's marked as empty.\n\n- Then moving up to (7,6): also empty.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nI also need to consider the enemy snake's position. It's at (1,6) with a body part at (2,6). That's quite far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take, so it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (7,6), I have a path to another apple without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I'll be larger, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't lead me into a dead end.\n\nLooking ahead, after eating (7,6), I could aim for (5,8), which is another apple not too far away.\n\nFrom (7,6), I can move left to (6,6), then up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8).\n\nThis seems manageable, assuming no obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,9) after (7,6), but that might require moving right back to (8,6) and then up, which could be riskier if the enemy snake moves towards that area.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (5,8) next would be better.\n\nBut for now, my immediate goal is to get to (7,6).\n\nSo, my first move should be to move left to (7,5).\n\nThen, I can move up to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nBut for now, I need to make sure that moving left to (7,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (7,5) is empty, and there are no snakes or walls there.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,5) is safe.\n\nAfter that, moving up to (7,6) should also be safe.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{LEFT}} \\]"

From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (7,7), I could continue up to (7,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,6):\n\n- Is (6,6) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (6,6), I could move left to (5,6), up to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, both directions seem viable after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples.\n\nThe apple at (5,8) is relatively close, with a distance of 5 from my current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,6), moving to (5,8) would involve moving left to (6,6), then up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), then up to (5,8).\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,9) is also an option, but it's a bit farther.\n\nFrom (7,6), moving right to (8,6), then up to (8,7), (8,8), and (8,9).\n\nBut that's a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (1,5) with a body part at (1,6).\n\nThat's quite far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take, so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nFor now, since the apple at (7,6) is right next to me and the path is clear, I think moving up to it is the best choice.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, I see that the apple is at (7,6), which is up from my current position at (7,5).\n\nSo, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nBut in the last move information, it says the direction was LEFT, which would be moving from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nWait, in the board, positions are listed with Y coordinates starting from 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 is at the top.\n\nIn the board diagram:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . .

So, that's row 7, column 7.\n\nWait, but in the board state, it shows:\n\n7 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,7), and perhaps has a tail somewhere else.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (8,9), (5,8), and (9,0).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (1,3) with a body at (1,4).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (7,7).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |7 - 0| = 7\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 7 = 9\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 1| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |7 - 2| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 6 + 5 = 11\n\n3. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |7 - 9| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |7 - 8| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (9,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 9| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |7 - 0| = 7\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 7 = 9\n\nSo, the apples at (8,9) and (5,8) are both close, with a total distance of 3.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apple at (8,9) is at the top-right corner.\n\n- Apple at (5,8) is a bit more central.\n\nI should consider which path is safer and which might lead me closer to other apples.\n\nLet's consider going for (5,8) first.\n\nFrom (7,7), to get to (5,8):\n\n- Move left to (6,7)\n\n- Move left to (5,7)\n\n- Move up to (5,8)\n\nThat's a path of three moves.\n\nBut I need to make sure that these positions are empty and safe.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (6,7): Is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (5,7): Is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (5,8): Has an apple.\n\nSo, that path is clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into a wall or myself.\n\nLet's think about where I can go after eating the apple at (5,8).\n\nFrom (5,8), I could:\n\n- Move up to (5,9)\n\n- Move left to (4,8)\n\n- Move right to (6,8)\n\n- Move down to (5,7)\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (5,9): Is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (4,8): Is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (6,8): Is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (5,7): Is it empty? Yes, as per earlier.\n\nSo, multiple options after eating the apple.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (1,3) with a body at (1,4).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nGiven that it's at (1,3) and has a body at (1,4), it's relatively far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting to (5,8).\n\nBut let's also consider the apple at (8,9), which is also at a distance of 3.\n\nFrom (7,7), to get to (8,9):\n\n- Move right to (8,7)\n\n- Move up to (8,8)\n\n- Move up to (8,9)\n\nThat's also a path of three moves.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (8,7): Is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,8): Is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- (8,9): Has an apple.\n\nSo, that path is also clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,9), I could consider moving towards another apple.\n\nBut considering that (5,8) is also close, maybe I should go for the one that leads me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- After (5,8), I could potentially go to (5,0), which is at (5,0), but that's a distance of 8 from (5,8).\n\n- After (8,9), I could go to (9,0), which is at (9,0), distance of 9 from (8,9).\n\nSo, perhaps going for (5,8) first makes sense because it's in a central position, and from there, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is at (1,3), moving towards (5,8) might keep some distance between us.\n\nBut I need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements in future turns.\n\nFor now, I'll plan to move towards (5,8).\n\nFrom (7,7), first move left to (6,7).\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT.\n\nBut wait, in the last move information, it says the direction was UP, which moved from some previous position to (7,7).\n\nI need to make sure that moving left from (7,7) is safe.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\n- Current position: (7,7)\n\n- Moving left to (6,7)\n\n- Is (6,7) empty? Yes.\n\n- After moving to (6,7), my tail will move from (8,7) to (7,7), assuming I have a body part at (8,7).\n\nWait, but in the board, snake 2 is at (7,7), with body at (8,7) and perhaps another part.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n7 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nAssuming that '2' is the head, and 'T' is the tail.\n\nBut in the description, snake 2 is at (7,7), with body at [(8,7)].\n\nWait, perhaps snake 2 is made up of (7,7), (8,7), and (8,6).\n\nFrom the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . T . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,7), (8,7), and (8,6).\n\nTherefore, if I move left from (7,7) to (6,7), my tail will move from (8,7) to (7,7).\n\nBut (7,7) is occupied by my head, which is moving to (6,7).\n\nWait, no, in snake games, when you move, the tail moves to where the head was previously.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,7) to (6,7), the body part at (8,7) will move to (7,7), and the tail at (8,6) will move to (8,7).\n\nSo, after the move:\n\n- Head: (6,7)\n\n- Body: (7,7), (8,7)\n\n- Tail: (8,6)\n\nThis seems fine, as none of these positions overlap.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (6,7) is safe.\n\nNext, from (6,7), I'll move left again to (5,7), then up to (5,8) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in each step, the path is clear and I don't run into anything.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any apples closer than (5,8).\n\nWait, looking back, there's an apple at (5,8), which is two moves away, and another apple at (8,9), which is also two moves away.\n\nBut (5,8) is closer in terms of vertical distance, as it's only one up from (5,7), whereas (8,9) is one right and two up from (7,7).\n\nPerhaps I should consider which path is safer or which leads me closer to more apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (8,9) first,"

Looking at the board, it seems like there are multiple apples scattered around, and I need to decide which one to go for first.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the apple positions:\n\n- (5,0)\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (3,1)\n\nNow, from my current position at (7,8), I need to calculate the distances to each of these apples to see which one is closest.\n\nLet's use Manhattan distance since the snake can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\n1. Distance to (5,0):\n\n   - Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n   - Vertical distance: |8 - 0| = 8\n\n   - Total distance: 2 + 8 = 10\n\n2. Distance to (8,9):\n\n   - Horizontal distance: |7 - 8| = 1\n\n   - Vertical distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n   - Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. Distance to (5,8):\n\n   - Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n   - Vertical distance: |8 - 8| = 0\n\n   - Total distance: 2 + 0 = 2\n\n4. Distance to (9,0):\n\n   - Horizontal distance: |7 - 9| = 2\n\n   - Vertical distance: |8 - 0| = 8\n\n   - Total distance: 2 + 8 = 10\n\n5.

Let's consider the paths to each:\n\nPath to (8,9):\n\n- From (7,8), move right to (8,8), then up to (8,9).\n\nPath to (5,8):\n\n- From (7,8), move left to (6,8), then left again to (5,8).\n\nBoth paths are equally short, so I need to consider other factors.\n\nLet's look at the board layout and see if there are any obstacles or potential dangers in either path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (8,8) seems empty.\n\n- (5,8) also seems empty.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,2) with body at (1,3).\n\nThat's quite far from my current position, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to either apple immediately.\n\nHowever, I should consider the long-term strategy.\n\nIf I go for (8,9), which is in the top-right corner, I might get stuck there if I don't plan properly, as corners can limit movement.\n\nOn the other hand, going to (5,8) might position me better to access other apples, like (5,0) or (3,1), which are both on the left side.\n\nAlso, (5,8) is in line with (5,0), so after eating (5,8), I can potentially move down to (5,7), then (5,6), and so on, towards (5,0).\n\nSimilarly, from (8,9), I can move down towards (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are apples at (9,0) which is bottom-right.\n\nWait, (9,0) is at the bottom-right, and (8,9) is top-right.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (8,9) first could allow me to pick up (9,0) next, but (9,0) is quite far vertically.\n\nAlternatively, going for (5,8) first could allow me to pick up (5,0) next, which is directly below.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Go to (5,8)\n\n- Then to (5,7), (5,6), ..., (5,0)\n\n- Then perhaps to (3,1)\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Go to (8,9)\n\n- Then to (8,8), (8,7), ..., (8,0)\n\n- Then to (9,0)\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (9,0), which is at the bottom-right.\n\nHmm.\n\nLooking at the board again, there's an apple at (9,0), which is at the bottom-right corner.\n\nIf I go to (8,9), I'll be at the top-right, and to get to (9,0), I need to move down to (8,8), (8,7), ..., (8,0), then right to (9,0).\n\nThat seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (5,8), then down to (5,7), (5,6), ..., (5,0), then perhaps right to (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0).\n\nBut that also seems lengthy.\n\nWait, but (9,0) has an apple, so I need to plan to pick that up as well.\n\nPerhaps I should consider a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (5,0)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (8,9)\n\nMaybe I should aim to pick up (5,8), then (5,0), then (3,1), then (8,9), then (9,0).\n\nBut that seems a bit scattered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (8,9), then (9,0), then (5,8), then (5,0), then (3,1).\n\nI need to find a path that minimizes the total distance traveled.\n\nLet me calculate the distances between the apples:\n\nDistance between (5,8) and (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal: 0\n\n- Vertical: 8\n\n- Total: 8\n\nDistance between (5,8) and (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal: 3\n\n- Vertical: 1\n\n- Total: 4\n\nDistance between (5,8) and (9,0):\n\n- Horizontal: 4\n\n- Vertical: 8\n\n- Total: 12\n\nDistance between (5,8) and (3,1):\n\n- Horizontal: 2\n\n- Vertical: 7\n\n- Total: 9\n\nDistance between (8,9) and (9,0):\n\n- Horizontal: 1\n\n- Vertical: 9\n\n- Total: 10\n\nDistance between (8,9) and (3,1):\n\n- Horizontal: 5\n\n- Vertical: 8\n\n- Total: 13\n\nDistance between (5,0) and (9,0):\n\n- Horizontal: 4\n\n- Vertical: 0\n\n- Total: 4\n\nDistance between (5,0) and (3,1):\n\n- Horizontal: 2\n\n- Vertical: 1\n\n- Total: 3\n\nDistance between (9,0) and (3,1):\n\n- Horizontal: 6\n\n- Vertical: 1\n\n- Total: 7\n\nLooking at these distances, perhaps the optimal path is:\n\n1. (5,8)\n\n2. (5,0)\n\n3. (3,1)\n\n4. (8,9)\n\n5. (9,0)\n\nLet's calculate the total distance:\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): 3\n\n- From (3,1) to (8,9): 10\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,0): 10\n\nTotal: 8 + 3 + 10 + 10 = 31\n\nAlternatively, the other order:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (9,0)\n\n3. (5,8)\n\n4. (5,0)\n\n5. (3,1)\n\nDistances:\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,0): 10\n\n- From (9,0) to (5,8): 12\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): 3\n\nTotal: 10 + 12 + 8 + 3 = 33\n\nSo, the first path is shorter with a total distance of 31 compared to 33.\n\nTherefore, it's better to go for (5,8) first, then (5,0), then (3,1), then (8,9), and finally (9,0).\n\nMoreover, starting with (5,8) positions me better to access (5,0) and (3,1), which are closer together, before moving to the top-right and bottom-right.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy snake at (1,2) with body at (1,3), it's currently far from my path, so I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nHowever, I should always be aware of its position and avoid colliding with it."

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: .

A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0\n\n- (1,2): column 1, row 2\n\n- (8,3): column 8, row 3\n\n- (3,7): column 3, row 7\n\n- (7,6): column 7, row 6\n\nAnd I'm at (8,1), which is column 8, row 1.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9), and I assume it's alone since its body is empty.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (8,1):\n\n- Up: (8,2)\n\n- Down: (8,0)\n\n- Left: (7,1)\n\n- Right: (9,1)\n\nBut wait, the board is 10x10, with x from 0 to 9 and y from 0 to 9. So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)?

I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

There are apples at (5,0), (1,2), (8,3), (3,7), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

So, moving right to (9,1) is allowed, but moving right from there would be (10,1), which is off the board and would cause me to die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (8,1) to (7,1), and so on.\n\nI need to think about which direction takes me closer to the apples while avoiding the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apples.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (5,0): that's somewhat diagonally down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,2): left and up.\n\n- (8,3): straight up from me.\n\n- (3,7): left and up quite a bit.\n\n- (7,6): left and up a bit.\n\nSo, apples are spread out in the upper left and lower middle areas.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet's think about the closest apple.\n\nFrom (8,1), the distances to the apples are:\n\n- (5,0): horizontal distance 3, vertical distance 1, so total distance 4.\n\n- (1,2): horizontal distance 7, vertical distance 1, total distance 8.\n\n- (8,3): horizontal distance 0, vertical distance 2, total distance 2.\n\n- (3,7): horizontal distance 5, vertical distance 6, total distance 11.\n\n- (7,6): horizontal distance 1, vertical distance 5, total distance 6.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,3), which is straight up from me by 2 steps.\n\nThat seems like a good target.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,1) to (8,2) to (8,3).\n\nIs there anything in (8,2)?

That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5.

That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

(Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4). So, that's row 4, column 9.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (8,9), and (5,8).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (9,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 1| = 8\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 7| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 5 = 6\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 8| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 4. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4. Move left to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating it, I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can consider my next target.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nI need to make sure that moving up to (9,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,7), which is row 7, column 2, with a body part at (3,7).\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (7,6), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is to go UP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 0| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 5 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 1| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 2| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 7| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 6| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 9| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 4 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 8| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 3 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 1. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (7,5), moving up to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving up to (7,6):\n\n- Is (7,6) empty? From the board, it's marked as having an apple.\n\n- So, it's safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into a wall or myself.\n\nLet's think about where I can go after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nFrom (7,6), I could:\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move left to (6,6)\n\n- Move right to (8,6)\n\n- Move down to (7,5)\n\nBut moving down to (7,5) would be risky because that's where I came from, and I need to make sure I don't get boxed in.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If I move up to (7,7), is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (7,7), I could continue up to (7,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,6):\n\n- Is (6,6) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (6,6), I could move left to (5,6), up to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, both directions seem viable after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples.\n\nThe apple at (5,8) is relatively close, with a distance of 5 from my current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,6), moving to (5,8) would involve moving left to (6,6), then up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), then up to (5,8).\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,9) is also an option, but it's a bit farther.\n\nFrom (7,6), moving right to (8,6), then up to (8,7), (8,8), and (8,9).\n\nBut that's a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (1,5) with a body part at (1,6).\n\nThat's quite far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take, so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nFor now, since the apple at (7,6) is right next to me and the path is clear, I think moving up to it is the best choice.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, I see that the apple is at (7,6), which is up from my current position at (7,5).\n\nSo, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nBut in the last move information, it says the direction was LEFT, which would be moving from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nWait, in the board, positions are listed with Y coordinates starting from 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 is at the top.\n\nIn the board diagram:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . .

A . . . .\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (7,5), which is column 7, row 5.\n\nThe apple is at (7,6), which is column 7, row 6, so that's upwards from my current position.\n\nBut in the last move, it says direction: LEFT, from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nWait, but moving left from (7,5) is to (6,5), which is to the left, decreasing X coordinate.\n\nBut the apple is at (7,6), which is upwards, increasing Y coordinate.\n\nI think there might be some confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps there are multiple snakes, and snake 2 is at (7,5), but the board shows snake 2 at (8,5) and (8,6).\n\nWait, in the board:\n\nRow 5: . 1 . . . . . 2 T T\n\nColumn 7: . . . . . . . .\n\nColumn 8: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nWait, perhaps I need to double-check the positions.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nAt row 5, column 7: 2 T T\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (8,6).\n\nWait, but the description says snake 2 is at (7,5).\n\nWait, perhaps there's a discrepancy between the board representation and the coordinate system.\n\nIn the board, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, position (7,5) is column 7, row 5.\n\nBut in the board, it shows snake 2 at columns 7 and 8, row 5.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: . 1 . . . . . 2 T T\n\nAssuming columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, column 7 has '2', column 8 has 'T', column 9 has 'T'.\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (9,5).\n\nWait, but the description says snake 2 is at (7,5).\n\nPerhaps the 'T' represents the tail.\n\nSo, snake 2 is mainly at (7,5), with tail at (8,5) and (9,5).\n\nWait, no, in snake games, 'T' usually stands for the tail.\n\nSo, perhaps snake 2 is at (7,5), (8,5), and (9,5), with head at (7,5).\n\nBut the apple is at (7,6), which is directly above the head.\n\nSo, to move up from (7,5) to (7,6), which is increasing Y coordinate.\n\nBut in the last move, it says direction: LEFT, which would be to (6,5).\n\nI think there might be a confusion in understanding the coordinate system or the board layout.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that moving up increases the Y coordinate, and moving right increases the X coordinate.\n\nGiven that, moving up from (7,"

Yes, as per earlier.\n\nSo, multiple options after eating the apple.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (1,3) with a body at (1,4).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nGiven that it's at (1,3) and has a body at (1,4), it's relatively far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting to (5,8).\n\nBut let's also consider the apple at (8,9), which is also at a distance of 3.\n\nFrom (7,7), to get to (8,9):\n\n- Move right to (8,7)\n\n- Move up to (8,8)\n\n- Move up to (8,9)\n\nThat's also a path of three moves.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (8,7): Is it empty?

Yes.\n\n- After moving to (6,7), my tail will move from (8,7) to (7,7), assuming I have a body part at (8,7).\n\nWait, but in the board, snake 2 is at (7,7), with body at (8,7) and perhaps another part.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n7 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nAssuming that '2' is the head, and 'T' is the tail.\n\nBut in the description, snake 2 is at (7,7), with body at [(8,7)].\n\nWait, perhaps snake 2 is made up of (7,7), (8,7), and (8,6).\n\nFrom the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . T . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,7), (8,7), and (8,6).\n\nTherefore, if I move left from (7,7) to (6,7), my tail will move from (8,7) to (7,7).\n\nBut (7,7) is occupied by my head, which is moving to (6,7).\n\nWait, no, in snake games, when you move, the tail moves to where the head was previously.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,7) to (6,7), the body part at (8,7) will move to (7,7), and the tail at (8,6) will move to (8,7).\n\nSo, after the move:\n\n- Head: (6,7)\n\n- Body: (7,7), (8,7)\n\n- Tail: (8,6)\n\nThis seems fine, as none of these positions overlap.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (6,7) is safe.\n\nNext, from (6,7), I'll move left again to (5,7), then up to (5,8) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in each step, the path is clear and I don't run into anything.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any apples closer than (5,8).\n\nWait, looking back, there's an apple at (5,8), which is two moves away, and another apple at (8,9), which is also two moves away.\n\nBut (5,8) is closer in terms of vertical distance, as it's only one up from (5,7), whereas (8,9) is one right and two up from (7,7).\n\nPerhaps I should consider which path is safer or which leads me closer to more apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (8,9) first,"

Looking at the board, it seems like there are multiple apples scattered around, and I need to decide which one to go for first.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the apple positions:\n\n- (5,0)\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (3,1)\n\nNow, from my current position at (7,8), I need to calculate the distances to each of these apples to see which one is closest.\n\nLet's use Manhattan distance since the snake can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\n1. Distance to (5,0):\n\n   - Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n   - Vertical distance: |8 - 0| = 8\n\n   - Total distance: 2 + 8 = 10\n\n2.

(5,8)\n\n2. (5,0)\n\n3. (3,1)\n\n4. (8,9)\n\n5. (9,0)\n\nLet's calculate the total distance:\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): 3\n\n- From (3,1) to (8,9): 10\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,0): 10\n\nTotal: 8 + 3 + 10 + 10 = 31\n\nAlternatively, the other order:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (9,0)\n\n3. (5,8)\n\n4. (5,0)\n\n5. (3,1)\n\nDistances:\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,0): 10\n\n- From (9,0) to (5,8): 12\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): 3\n\nTotal: 10 + 12 + 8 + 3 = 33\n\nSo, the first path is shorter with a total distance of 31 compared to 33.\n\nTherefore, it's better to go for (5,8) first, then (5,0), then (3,1), then (8,9), and finally (9,0).\n\nMoreover, starting with (5,8) positions me better to access (5,0) and (3,1), which are closer together, before moving to the top-right and bottom-right.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy snake at (1,2) with body at (1,3), it's currently far from my path, so I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nHowever, I should always be aware of its position and avoid colliding with it."

Distance to (5,0):\n\n   - Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n   - Vertical distance: |8 - 0| = 8\n\n   - Total distance: 3 + 8 = 11\n\n2.

Let's consider the paths to each:\n\nPath to (8,9):\n\n- From (8,8), move up to (8,9).\n\nPath to (5,8):\n\n- From (8,8), move left to (7,8), then left again to (6,8), then left to (5,8).\n\nThe path to (8,9) is just one move, while the path to (5,8) is three moves. So, it's much quicker to go for (8,9).\n\nBut I should consider if there are any obstacles or potential dangers in either path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (8,9) is adjacent to my current position.\n\n- There are no other snakes or parts of my body near (8,9), so it should be safe to move there.\n\n- Similarly, moving left to (5,8) seems safe, but it's a longer path.\n\nHowever, after eating (8,9), I would need to decide my next move. Let's think ahead.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), my snake will grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a trap where I might collide with my own body.\n\nAlso, I should consider the positions of other snakes. There's Snake #1 at (2,2) with body at (1,2) and (1,3). That's quite far from my current position, so it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nBut I need to be cautious as the game progresses.\n\nLet me consider the sequence of apple pickups.\n\nIf I go for (8,9) first:\n\n- Eat (8,9)\n\n- Then, perhaps go to (5,8), then to (5,0), then to (3,1), and finally to (9,0).\n\nCalculating the distances:\n\n- From (8,9) to (5,8): Horizontal 3, Vertical 1 \u2192 Total 4\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): Horizontal 0, Vertical 8 \u2192 Total 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): Horizontal 2, Vertical 1 \u2192 Total 3\n\n- From (3,1) to (9,0): Horizontal 6, Vertical 1 \u2192 Total 7\n\nTotal path distance: 1 (to 8,9) + 4 + 8 + 3 + 7 = 23\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,8) first:\n\n- Eat (5,8)\n\n- Then go to (5,0), then to (3,1), then to (8,9), then to (9,0).\n\nDistances:\n\n- From (8,8) to (5,8): Horizontal 3 \u2192 Total 3\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): Horizontal 0, Vertical 8 \u2192 Total 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): Horizontal 2, Vertical 1 \u2192 Total 3\n\n- From (3,1) to (8,9): Horizontal 5, Vertical 8 \u2192 Total 13\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,0): Horizontal 1, Vertical 9 \u2192 Total 10\n\nTotal path distance: 3 + 8 + 3 + 13 + 10 = 37\n\nWait, that's longer than the first option.\n\nSo, going for the closest apple first seems more efficient in terms of distance traveled.\n\nBut maybe there's a better sequence.\n\nLet me consider going for (5,8), then (5,0), then (9,0), then (8,9), then (3,1).\n\nDistances:\n\n- From (8,8) to (5,8): 3\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (9,0): 4\n\n- From (9,0) to (8,9): 10\n\n- From (8,9) to (3,1): 13\n\nTotal: 3 + 8 + 4 + 10 + 13 = 38\n\nStill longer than the first option.\n\nAlternatively, (8,9), (9,0), (5,8), (5,0), (3,1):\n\nDistances:\n\n- From (8,8) to (8,9): 1\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,0): 10\n\n- From (9,0) to (5,8): 12\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): 3\n\nTotal: 1 + 10 + 12 + 8 + 3 = 34\n\nStill higher than 23.\n\nSo, the first option seems best.\n\nMoreover, picking (8,9) first allows me to secure that apple quickly and then proceed to others.\n\nI should also consider the positions of other snakes.\n\nSnake #1 is at (2,2) with body at (1,2) and (1,3). It's moving upwards or to the right, but it's not immediately threatening my path to (8,9).\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that after eating (8,9), my snake doesn't box itself into a corner.\n\nAt (8,9), which is the top row, I would only have two possible moves: down or left.\n\nSo, after eating (8,9), I should plan to move down towards (8,8), then possibly left or right based on the next apple target.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. Move up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move down to (8,8).\n\n3. From there, decide whether to go left towards (5,8) or right towards (9,0).\n\nBut considering the distances, going to (5,8) next would be better.\n\nWait, but (5,8) is at the same row, so from (8,8), I can move left to (7,8), then (6,8), then (5,8).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, (9,0) is at (9,0), which would require moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,7), ..., down to (9,0), which is 8 moves.\n\nSo, it's much faster to go to (5,8) next.\n\nTherefore, revised plan:\n\n1. Eat (8,9)\n\n2. Move down to (8,8)\n\n3. Move left to (7,8)\n\n4. Move left to (6,8)\n\n5. Move left to (5,8)\n\n6. Then down to (5,7), (5,6), ..., (5,0)\n\n7. Then perhaps left or right based on the next apple.\n\nThis seems a logical sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I don't collide with my own body as I grow.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back into my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm moving in straight lines, as long as I don't make abrupt turns, I should be fine."

Enemy snake number 1 is at (2,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout.

Looking at the board, row 2, column 8: it's empty. Row 3, column 8: that's the apple.\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,9). That's upper left area. Since I'm at (8,1), lower right, and the apple is straight up at (8,3), and the enemy is far away, it's unlikely to interfere with my path immediately.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy snake has no body parts, it's just the head, and I don't know its direction or intentions.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed upwards towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nBut, I should think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nAssuming I move to (8,2), then to (8,3), eating the apple, my tail will stay where it was, since I'm moving forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so your body extends.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when you move forward, your tail stays in place unless you're growing.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIn classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move on that turn, and your snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, in this game, I need to confirm how it works.\n\nFrom the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\"\n\nDoes that mean that when I move onto the apple, my tail stays where it was, and my snake grows by one segment?\n\nWait, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays stationary, and your head moves to the new position, and then on the next move, your tail moves forward, but since you've grown, the tail remains in its previous position.\n\nWait, I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me assume that when I move onto the apple, my snake grows by adding a new segment where my tail was, and then I can continue moving.\n\nBut to simplify, for now, I'll consider that after eating the apple, my snake has an additional segment where my tail was.\n\nBut for this immediate decision, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I can ignore the growth effect.\n\nSo, back to the decision.\n\nI'm at (8,1). I can move up to (8,2), which is empty, then to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems safe, as it's empty, and it's on the path to the apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (7,1), but that's not directly towards the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the path to the apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (8,2), then next turn, I can move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will stay, and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't approaching my tail or something.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (2,9), which is far away, it's unlikely to be a immediate threat.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about other apples.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), the next closest apple might be at (5,0), but that's diagonally down and left.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of eating the apple at (8,3), which is right above me.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,2) seems like a safe first step.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction might be better.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\n- Moving right to (9,1): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\n- Moving left to (7,1): that's empty.\n\n- Moving down to (8,0): that's edge of the board, and beyond that is death.\n\nSo, moving up or left seem safe for now.\n\nBut moving left to (7,1) would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nUnless I have a reason to go left, moving up seems more beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (8,2).\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think about potential snake interactions.\n\nEven though the enemy is far away, I should consider if it might move towards me.\n\nBut given the distance, it's unlikely to reach me in the next move.\n\nMoreover, since I'm moving towards an apple, which is a high-priority target, and the enemy is elsewhere, I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move up to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,3). So, that's row 3, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (3,7), (7,6), and (9,4).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,8), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,3).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 0| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 2| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 1 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (3,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 3| = 5\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 7| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n4. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |3 - 4| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 2. That means it's just one step to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

(Apple at 5,0)\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, there seems to be some confusion in the board description. It says \"Row 2: . A . . . . . . T .\", but T might represent something else, perhaps the tail of another snake.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my position and the apple at (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,3), moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if moving right to (9,3) is safe. Is there anything at (9,3)? From the board, row 3, column 9 is empty, as per the board representation.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,3), then up to (9,4) seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I need to decide just my next move, not a sequence. So, should I move right towards (9,3) now?\n\nWait, but looking back at the apple positions, there's an apple at (9,4), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nAnd (3,7), which is left and up more.\n\nBut (9,4) is the closest.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,3). It's in the upper left area, while I'm in the lower right.\n\nGiven that, the enemy snake isn't posing an immediate threat, especially since it has no body parts.\n\nSo, for now, I can focus on getting the closest apple at (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Right to (9,3)\n\n- Up to (9,4)\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right to (9,3) is safe.\n\nIs there anything at (9,3)? From the board, it seems empty.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut for now, just planning the next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (8,3) to (8,4), and then right to (9,4).\n\nLet's compare the two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,3)\n\n- Move up to (9,4)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\nBoth paths are equally short, two moves each.\n\nBut perhaps moving up first might be better because it takes me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (8,4), I can then move right to (9,4), eating the apple.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving left or up to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving up from (9,4) would be (9,5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving left would be (8,4), but that's where I came from.\n\nActually, after eating (9,4), I might want to aim for (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps getting the apple at (9,4) isn't the best strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim for a cluster of apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are spread out:\n\n- (5,0) in the bottom middle\n\n- (1,2) in the lower left\n\n- (3,7) in the upper left\n\n- (7,6) in the upper middle\n\n- (9,4) on the right side\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the apples in the upper middle: (7,6) and (3,7).\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (5,0), which is down and left.\n\nBut that's also a bit far.\n\nGiven that, maybe getting the closest apple at (9,4) is still the best option.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide my next move based on the new board state.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide just the next move.\n\nSo, to get to (9,4), I can either move right to (9,3) or up to (8,4).\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMoving right to (9,3):\n\n- Next move would be up to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving left or up.\n\nMoving up to (8,4):\n\n- Next move would be right to (9,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, same as above.\n\nI think moving right to (9,3) first might be slightly better because it keeps me closer to the edge, potentially limiting the enemy snake's ability to box me in.\n\nBut in this case, with the enemy snake being far away, it might not be a concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,4) might position me better for future moves.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the positions of other apples.\n\nAfter eating (9,4), I'd be at (9,4). From there, the next closest apple is (7,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's a few moves away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (7,6) directly from (8,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (7,5)\n\n- Up to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nBut compared to going to (9,4) in two moves and then to (7,6) in four moves, it's roughly the same number of moves.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total distance.\n\nFrom (8,3"

So, that's row 4, column 8.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (9,4), and (8,9).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (8,4).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 5| = 3\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 0| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 1| = 7\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 2| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 7 + 2 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 7| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 6| = 2\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. Apple at (9,4):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 9| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 4| = 0\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 0 = 1\n\n5. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |8 - 8| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 9| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (9,4) is the closest with a distance of 1. That means it's just one step to the right from my current position.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the board to see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . 2 A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, it seems like the apple at (9,4) is right next to me, at (9,4).\n\nSo, moving right to (9,4) would allow me to eat it immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about what's beyond that position.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,4), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or leave myself with nowhere to go.\n\nAlso, I should consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), with a body part at (3,8). That's quite far from my current position at (8,4), so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (9,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll be at (9,4), and I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (5,0): bottom middle\n\n- (1,2): lower left\n\n- (7,6): upper middle\n\n- (8,9): top right\n\nI should think about which one to target next.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is straight up from my current position, just four moves up to (8,8), then one more up to (8,9).\n\nBut, there might be obstacles or the enemy snake might be moving.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,6) is left and up.\n\nBut, the apple at (5,0) is down and left, which is quite a distance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim for (8,9) next, since it's in line with my current position.\n\nBut first things first, I need to move to (9,4).\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is straightforward.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll need to decide whether to move up towards (8,9) or left towards (7,6).\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move left to (8,4)\n\n- Move up to (8,5)\n\n- Continue up to (8,9)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move right to (9,4)\n\n- Move up to (9,5)\n\n- Then what? There are no apples in that direction.\n\nSo, Option 1 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), but there's no apple there, and it might not lead me anywhere useful.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (9,4) to (8,4), then up to (8,5), and so on to (8,9) seems like a plan.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move is to go right to (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (3,7), and its body is at (3,8). It's quite far from my current position, and unlikely to interfere with my immediate moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most straightforward move is to go right to (9,4) and eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision for the next move is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |9 - 5| = 4\n\n- Vertical distance: |4 - 8| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 4. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,4), moving left to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (8,5), (8,6)\n\n- Then left to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving left to (8,4):\n\n- Is (8,4) empty? From the board, it's marked as 'T', which I think stands for the snake's tail. Wait, no, 'T' might stand for the snake's body. Wait, in the board description, 'T' might represent the snake's body parts.\n\nLooking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . T 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . T .\n\nRow 2: .

In row 4, column 8, there's a 'T', which is my body part since I'm at (9,4), which is row 4, column 9.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,4), which has 'T', that's part of my body. If I move onto my own body, I die. So, I can't move left to (8,4).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, moving left isn't an option because it's my own body.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n\nLet's consider moving up from (9,4) to (9,5).\n\n- Is (9,5) empty? From the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n- Then I can continue moving up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), but there's an apple at (8,9). Wait, but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (10,4), but the board only goes up to 9 in the x-direction, so that's off the board, meaning I'd die.\n\nSo, moving right isn't an option.\n\nMoving down from (9,4) to (9,3):\n\n- Is (9,3) empty? From the board, row 3, column 9 is 'T', which is likely my tail.\n\n- Moving onto my own body would cause me to die.\n\nSo, moving down isn't an option.\n\nThat leaves moving up as the only safe move.\n\nWait, but moving up to (9,5) is safe, but then what?\n\nFrom (9,5), I can continue up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9) to get the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any other obstacles along the way.\n\nLet's think about the enemy snake's position.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,7), with a body part at (3,7).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into it.\n\nIf I move up to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), and then left to (8,9), by that time, the enemy snake might have moved, but it's currently at (2,7), which is quite far from my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, which it might not, since it has its own apples to go for, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility that the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\nHowever, given the distances, it's unlikely to reach me in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like a safe option.\n\nBut in the short term, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nThen, continue moving up until I reach (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (8,9), I have a path to another apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), I'll be at (8,9), and then I can consider moving down or left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), (8,7), etc., but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (7,9), then down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (7,6) instead.\n\nTo get there, from (9,4), I can move left to (8,4), but that's my body, so I can't.\n\nAlternatively, move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), then up to (8,6), then left to (7,6).\n\nBut again, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5):\n\n- Is (8,5) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- Then up to (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- Then left to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis might be a better and shorter path.\n\nLet me check the steps:\n\n1. Move up to (9,5)\n\n2. Move left to (8,5)\n\n3. Move up to (8,6)\n\n4. Move left to (7,6)\n\nThat's four moves to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating it, I'll have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I can consider my next target.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be up to (9,5).\n\nI need to make sure that moving up to (9,5) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,7), which is row 7, column 2, with a body part at (3,7).\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (7,6), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is to go UP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,5). So, that's row 5, column 7.\n\nThere are apples at these positions: (5,0), (1,2), (7,6), (8,9), and (5,8).\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (1,5) with a body part at (1,6).\n\nI need to think about where to move next: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. That might be the best one to go for first.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (7,5).\n\n1. Apple at (5,0):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 0| = 5\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 5 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (1,2):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 1| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 2| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (7,6):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 7| = 0\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 6| = 1\n\n- Total distance: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n4. Apple at (8,9):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 8| = 1\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 9| = 4\n\n- Total distance: 1 + 4 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (5,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |7 - 5| = 2\n\n- Vertical distance: |5 - 8| = 3\n\n- Total distance: 2 + 3 = 5\n\nOkay, so the apple at (7,6) is the closest with a distance of 1. Let's see if there's a clear path to it.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (7,5), moving up to (7,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, moving up to (7,6):\n\n- Is (7,6) empty? From the board, it's marked as having an apple.\n\n- So, it's safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't immediately run into a wall or myself.\n\nLet's think about where I can go after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nFrom (7,6), I could:\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\n- Move left to (6,6)\n\n- Move right to (8,6)\n\n- Move down to (7,5)\n\nBut moving down to (7,5) would be risky because that's where I came from, and I need to make sure I don't get boxed in.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If I move up to (7,7), is it empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (7,7), I could continue up to (7,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,6):\n\n- Is (6,6) empty? From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- From (6,6), I could move left to (5,6), up to (5,7), etc.\n\nSo, both directions seem viable after eating the apple at (7,6).\n\nI should also consider the positions of other apples.\n\nThe apple at (5,8) is relatively close, with a distance of 5 from my current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,6), moving to (5,8) would involve moving left to (6,6), then up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), then up to (5,8).\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,9) is also an option, but it's a bit farther.\n\nFrom (7,6), moving right to (8,6), then up to (8,7), (8,8), and (8,9).\n\nBut that's a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (1,5) with a body part at (1,6).\n\nThat's quite far from my current position and the path I'm planning to take, so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nFor now, since the apple at (7,6) is right next to me and the path is clear, I think moving up to it is the best choice.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, I see that the apple is at (7,6), which is up from my current position at (7,5).\n\nSo, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nBut in the last move information, it says the direction was LEFT, which would be moving from (7,5) to (6,5).\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nWait, in the board, positions are listed with Y coordinates starting from 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 is at the top.\n\nIn the board diagram:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . .

Yes.\n\n- After moving to (6,7), my tail will move from (8,7) to (7,7), assuming I have a body part at (8,7).\n\nWait, but in the board, snake 2 is at (7,7), with body at (8,7) and perhaps another part.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\n7 . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nAssuming that '2' is the head, and 'T' is the tail.\n\nBut in the description, snake 2 is at (7,7), with body at [(8,7)].\n\nWait, perhaps snake 2 is made up of (7,7), (8,7), and (8,6).\n\nFrom the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . T . .\n\nSo, snake 2 is at (7,7), (8,7), and (8,6).\n\nTherefore, if I move left from (7,7) to (6,7), my tail will move from (8,7) to (7,7).\n\nBut (7,7) is occupied by my head, which is moving to (6,7).\n\nWait, no, in snake games, when you move, the tail moves to where the head was previously.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,7) to (6,7), the body part at (8,7) will move to (7,7), and the tail at (8,6) will move to (8,7).\n\nSo, after the move:\n\n- Head: (6,7)\n\n- Body: (7,7), (8,7)\n\n- Tail: (8,6)\n\nThis seems fine, as none of these positions overlap.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (6,7) is safe.\n\nNext, from (6,7), I'll move left again to (5,7), then up to (5,8) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in each step, the path is clear and I don't run into anything.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any apples closer than (5,8).\n\nWait, looking back, there's an apple at (5,8), which is two moves away, and another apple at (8,9), which is also two moves away.\n\nBut (5,8) is closer in terms of vertical distance, as it's only one up from (5,7), whereas (8,9) is one right and two up from (7,7).\n\nPerhaps I should consider which path is safer or which leads me closer to more apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (8,9) first,"

There's Snake #1 at (2,2) with body at (1,2) and (1,3). That's quite far from my current position, so it shouldn't interfere immediately.\n\nBut I need to be cautious as the game progresses.\n\nLet me consider the sequence of apple pickups.\n\nIf I go for (8,9) first:\n\n- Eat (8,9)\n\n- Then, perhaps go to (5,8), then to (5,0), then to (3,1), and finally to (9,0).\n\nCalculating the distances:\n\n- From (8,9) to (5,8): Horizontal 3, Vertical 1 \u2192 Total 4\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): Horizontal 0, Vertical 8 \u2192 Total 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): Horizontal 2, Vertical 1 \u2192 Total 3\n\n- From (3,1) to (9,0): Horizontal 6, Vertical 1 \u2192 Total 7\n\nTotal path distance: 1 (to 8,9) + 4 + 8 + 3 + 7 = 23\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,8) first:\n\n- Eat (5,8)\n\n- Then go to (5,0), then to (3,1), then to (8,9), then to (9,0).\n\nDistances:\n\n- From (8,8) to (5,8): Horizontal 3 \u2192 Total 3\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): Horizontal 0, Vertical 8 \u2192 Total 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): Horizontal 2, Vertical 1 \u2192 Total 3\n\n- From (3,1) to (8,9): Horizontal 5, Vertical 8 \u2192 Total 13\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,0): Horizontal 1, Vertical 9 \u2192 Total 10\n\nTotal path distance: 3 + 8 + 3 + 13 + 10 = 37\n\nWait, that's longer than the first option.\n\nSo, going for the closest apple first seems more efficient in terms of distance traveled.\n\nBut maybe there's a better sequence.\n\nLet me consider going for (5,8), then (5,0), then (9,0), then (8,9), then (3,1).\n\nDistances:\n\n- From (8,8) to (5,8): 3\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (9,0): 4\n\n- From (9,0) to (8,9): 10\n\n- From (8,9) to (3,1): 13\n\nTotal: 3 + 8 + 4 + 10 + 13 = 38\n\nStill longer than the first option.\n\nAlternatively, (8,9), (9,0), (5,8), (5,0), (3,1):\n\nDistances:\n\n- From (8,8) to (8,9): 1\n\n- From (8,9) to (9,0): 10\n\n- From (9,0) to (5,8): 12\n\n- From (5,8) to (5,0): 8\n\n- From (5,0) to (3,1): 3\n\nTotal: 1 + 10 + 12 + 8 + 3 = 34\n\nStill higher than 23.\n\nSo, the first option seems best.\n\nMoreover, picking (8,9) first allows me to secure that apple quickly and then proceed to others.\n\nI should also consider the positions of other snakes.\n\nSnake #1 is at (2,2) with body at (1,2) and (1,3). It's moving upwards or to the right, but it's not immediately threatening my path to (8,9).\n\nHowever, I need to keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that after eating (8,9), my snake doesn't box itself into a corner.\n\nAt (8,9), which is the top row, I would only have two possible moves: down or left.\n\nSo, after eating (8,9), I should plan to move down towards (8,8), then possibly left or right based on the next apple target.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. Move up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move down to (8,8).\n\n3. From there, decide whether to go left towards (5,8) or right towards (9,0).\n\nBut considering the distances, going to (5,8) next would be better.\n\nWait, but (5,8) is at the same row, so from (8,8), I can move left to (7,8), then (6,8), then (5,8).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, (9,0) is at (9,0), which would require moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,7), ..., down to (9,0), which is 8 moves.\n\nSo, it's much faster to go to (5,8) next.\n\nTherefore, revised plan:\n\n1. Eat (8,9)\n\n2. Move down to (8,8)\n\n3. Move left to (7,8)\n\n4. Move left to (6,8)\n\n5. Move left to (5,8)\n\n6. Then down to (5,7), (5,6), ..., (5,0)\n\n7. Then perhaps left or right based on the next apple.\n\nThis seems a logical sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I don't collide with my own body as I grow.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back into my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm moving in straight lines, as long as I don't make abrupt turns, I should be fine."

Distance to (6,2):\n\n   - Horizontal distance: |8 - 6| = 2\n\n   - Vertical distance: |9 - 2| = 7\n\n   - Total distance: 2 + 7 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is (5,8) with a distance of 4, followed by (6,2) at 9, then (9,0) at 10, (5,0) at 12, and (3,1) at 13.\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the path to each apple and whether there are any obstacles or if picking one apple might block the path to another.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the positions of other snakes.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Snake #1 is at (2,1) with body at (2,2) and (1,2).\n\n- My snake is at (8,9).\n\nSo, Snake #1 is in the lower left area, and I'm in the upper right.\n\nIt seems like for now, Snake #1 isn't immediately threatening my path to any of the apples.\n\nLet me consider the sequence in which I can pick up the apples.\n\nOption 1: Go for the closest apple, which is (5,8).\n\nFrom (8,9), moving left to (7,9), then (6,9), then (5,9), then down to (5,8).\n\nThat's a total of 4 moves.\n\nAfter eating (5,8), I can proceed to another apple.\n\nNext closest might be (5,0), which is directly down from (5,8), so 8 moves down.\n\nThen, maybe go to (9,0), which is right from (5,0), 4 moves right.\n\nThen, (3,1), which is left from (9,0), 6 moves left, then up to (3,1), 8 moves up.\n\nFinally, (6,2), which is from (3,1), right 3, up 1.\n\nThis seems a bit inefficient.\n\nOption 2: Go for (6,2) next.\n\nFrom (5,8), move down to (5,7), ..., down to (5,2), then right to (6,2).\n\nThat's 6 moves down plus 1 right, total 7 moves.\n\nThen, go to (9,0): right 3 to (9,2), then down to (9,0), 2 moves down.\n\nThen, (5,0): left 4 to (5,0).\n\nThen, (3,1): left 2 to (3,0), then up to (3,1).\n\nThis seems a bit better, but still not optimal.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider a different order.\n\nAlternative Option: Go for (9,0) after (5,8).\n\nFrom (5,8), go down to (5,0), then right to (9,0), then up to (9,1), then left to (3,1), then up to (3,2), then right to (6,2).\n\nThis might be more efficient.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider going for (9,0) first.\n\nFrom (8,9), moving down to (8,0), then right to (9,0).\n\nWait, moving down from (8,9) to (8,0) is 9 moves down, then right to (9,0) is 1 move right, total 10 moves.\n\nThat's the same as the distance from (8,9) to (9,0).\n\nBut compared to going to (5,8) first, which is only 4 moves away, it's faster to go for (5,8).\n\nSo, perhaps going for (5,8) first is better.\n\nAfter eating (5,8), I can consider going to (5,0), which is directly down, 8 moves.\n\nThen, go to (9,0): right 4 to (9,0), 4 moves.\n\nThen, (3,1): left 6 to (3,0), then up to (3,1), total 7 moves.\n\nThen, (6,2): right 3, up 1, total 4 moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4 (to 5,8) + 8 (to 5,0) + 4 (to 9,0) + 7 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 6,2) = 27 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going directly to (9,0):\n\nFrom (8,9), down 9 to (8,0), then right to (9,0), total 10 moves.\n\nThen, go to (5,0): left 4 to (5,0), 4 moves.\n\nThen, (3,1): left 2 to (3,0), up to (3,1), total 3 moves.\n\nThen, (5,8): up 7 to (3,8), then right 2 to (5,8), total 9 moves.\n\nThen, (6,2): down 6 to (5,2), then right 1 to (6,2), total 7 moves.\n\nTotal moves: 10 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 33 moves.\n\nSo, going for (5,8) first is faster.\n\nAnother consideration: If I go for (5,8) first, I can pick up that apple quickly and potentially block other snakes from getting to it.\n\nBut in this case, Snake #1 is far away, so it's not an immediate concern.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in while moving towards the apples.\n\nFor example, if I go down from (5,8) to (5,0), I need to ensure that I have a clear path and that my growing body doesn't block my own way.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider picking up (9,0) after (5,8), but that would require moving right from (5,8) to (9,8), then down to (9,0), which is 4 moves right and 8 moves down, total 12 moves.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated it as 4 moves to (9,8) and then down to (9,0), which is 8 moves down, total 12 moves.\n\nComparing to going down to (5,0) first, which is only 8 moves down.\n\nSo, perhaps going down to (5,0) after (5,8) is better.\n\nThen, from (5,0), go to (9,0): right 4 to (9,0), 4 moves.\n\nThen, (3,1): left 6 to (3,0), up to (3,1), total 7 moves.\n\nThen, (6,2): right 3, up 1, total 4 moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4 (to 5,8) + 8 (to 5,0) + 4 (to 9,0) + 7 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 6,2) = 27 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going from (5,8) to (6,2): down 6 to (6,2), 6 moves.\n\nThen, to ("
