Since I'm currently at (1, 9), I can move up (DOWN would take me outside the board), left (LEFT would take me to the wall), and right (RIGHT is the next available move).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples and my goal to gain points. The apples are at (5, 7), (3, 0), (1, 6), (1, 0), and (3, 3). Moving right (as is my next available move) would take me closer to the apple at (3, 3), but it's not an immediate apple pickup.\n\nMoving up would take me closer to the apple at (5, 7), but I would also be moving away from the apple at (3, 0). However, the apple at (5, 7) seems to be further from the enemy snake than the apple at (3, 0).\n\nSo, my strategy for this turn would be to move towards the apple that is further from the enemy snake. In this case, that would be the apple at (5, 7).\n\nNext move: UP."
