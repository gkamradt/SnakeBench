We have several apple options: at (8,1) (which is directly below), (9,2), (2,4), (2,7), and (0,0). The most straightforward one is clearly the apple at (8,1).\n\nLooking at our board, here\u2019s what we see about the moves from (8,5):\n\n\u2022 UP would take us to (8,6), but row 6, column 8 has a tree.\n\u2022 DOWN takes us to (8,4). Row 4 is clear (and even has an apple at (2,4), but that\u2019s out of our way). In column 8 from y=5 down to y=1, every space is free and safe.\n\u2022 LEFT would end up at (7,5) and RIGHT at (9,5). While both moves are safe, they don\u2019t guide us as directly to the apple at (8,1).\n\nSince our vertical path downward is clear, the best strategy is to continue moving DOWN toward the apple at (8,1).\n\nMy next move is: DOWN."
