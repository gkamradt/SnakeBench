It's advisable to consider them if moving to that zone promises a chain of apple consumption with minimal risk.\n   - The apple at `(5, 0)` requires moving diagonally downwards, crossing several empty spaces.\n   - The apple at `(2, 9)` is very far, and pursuing it directly could risk a run-in with Snake #2.\n\n3. **Immediate Strategy**:\n   - I want to maintain flexibility and minimize immediate risks.

It's advisable to consider them if moving to that zone promises a chain of apple consumption with minimal risk.\n   - The apple at `(5, 0)` requires moving diagonally downwards, crossing several empty spaces.\n   - The apple at `(2, 9)` is very far, and pursuing it directly could risk a run-in with Snake #2.\n\n3. **Immediate Strategy**:\n   - I want to maintain flexibility and minimize immediate risks.

I need to evaluate which apple I should pursue next based on distance and safety.\n\n2. **Distance to Apples**:\n   - The apple at `(9, 3)` is relatively close since it's to the right and slightly downwards.\n   - The apples `(0, 1)` and `(1, 1)` are farthest but grouped. It's advisable to consider them if moving to that zone promises a chain of apple consumption with minimal risk.\n   - The apple at `(5, 0)` requires moving diagonally downwards, crossing several empty spaces.\n   - The apple at `(2, 9)` is very far, and pursuing it directly could risk a run-in with Snake #2.\n\n3. **Immediate Strategy**:\n   - I want to maintain flexibility and minimize immediate risks. Snake #2 at `(2, 7)` does not currently intersect my path. However, it\u2019s important to keep some distance and avoid any potential confrontations.\n   \n4. **Potential Moves**:\n   - **UP** to `(8, 7)`: This move maintains my current horizontal alignment and keeps me in open space. While there are no immediate apples, it positions me neutrally for adjustments based on future moves of Snake #2.\n   - **RIGHT** to `(9, 6)`: Moves me closer to the apple at `(9, 3)`. This approach narrows my options in the event of a future confrontation with Snake #2 or barriers, but overall, seems beneficial for a next apple grab.\n   - **LEFT** or **DOWN**: Not advisable currently. LEFT increases my distance to any apples and DOWN moves away from the direction of the mostly closest apples.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Moving to `(9, 6)` grants direct access to a potential apple at `(9, 3)` and also provides an advantage of flexibility towards movement options without blocking myself against Snake #2's potential maneuvers.\n\n**Strategic Consideration next turn**:\n- Focus on grabbing the apple at `(9, 3)`, but stay vigilant to any movements by Snake #2 and future apple placements to avoid being trapped.\n- Continuously reassess positioning advantage after each move for capturing apples while evading threats.\n\n**Conclusion and Decided Move**: RIGHT to `(9, 6)`."

Of these, the apple at `(5, 0)` is relatively accessible, but will need careful navigation.\n\n3. **Immediate Strategy**:\n   - I can move DOWN to `(9, 2)` to quickly consume the apple below me.\n   - Once that apple is secured, shift focus towards reaching `(5, 0)`, potentially moving LEFT while avoiding walls.\n\n4. **Potential Moves**:\n   - **DOWN** to `(9, 2)`: This is the logical next move to consume the apple below.\n   - **LEFT or RIGHT**: These options are not immediately beneficial as the closer apple is directly below.\n   - **UP**: Not advisable since it would move away from the apple.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Moving DOWN is low-risk and gains me another point and increase in length.\n   - Snake #2 remains distant and concentrated at the top left, currently not a threat to my immediate strategy.\n\n6. **Strategic Consideration for Next Turn**:\n   - After eating the apple at `(9, 2)`, re-evaluate the board.

I need to evaluate which apple I should pursue next based on distance and safety.\n\n2. **Distance to Apples**:\n   - The apple at `(9, 3)` is relatively close since it's to the right and slightly downwards.\n   - The apples `(0, 1)` and `(1, 1)` are farthest but grouped. It's advisable to consider them if moving to that zone promises a chain of apple consumption with minimal risk.\n   - The apple at `(5, 0)` requires moving diagonally downwards, crossing several empty spaces.\n   - The apple at `(2, 9)` is very far, and pursuing it directly could risk a run-in with Snake #2.\n\n3. **Immediate Strategy**:\n   - I want to maintain flexibility and minimize immediate risks.

However, it\u2019s important to keep some distance and avoid any potential confrontations.\n   \n4. **Potential Moves**:\n   - **UP** to `(8, 7)`: This move maintains my current horizontal alignment and keeps me in open space. While there are no immediate apples, it positions me neutrally for adjustments based on future moves of Snake #2.\n   - **RIGHT** to `(9, 6)`: Moves me closer to the apple at `(9, 3)`. This approach narrows my options in the event of a future confrontation with Snake #2 or barriers, but overall, seems beneficial for a next apple grab.\n   - **LEFT** or **DOWN**: Not advisable currently.

It's advisable to consider them if moving to that zone promises a chain of apple consumption with minimal risk.\n   - The apple at `(5, 0)` requires moving diagonally downwards, crossing several empty spaces.\n   - The apple at `(2, 9)` is very far, and pursuing it directly could risk a run-in with Snake #2.\n\n3. **Immediate Strategy**:\n   - I want to maintain flexibility and minimize immediate risks.

It's advisable to consider them if moving to that zone promises a chain of apple consumption with minimal risk.\n   - The apple at `(5, 0)` requires moving diagonally downwards, crossing several empty spaces.\n   - The apple at `(2, 9)` is very far, and pursuing it directly could risk a run-in with Snake #2.\n\n3. **Immediate Strategy**:\n   - I want to maintain flexibility and minimize immediate risks.

It presents a straightforward path to an apple and afterwards, I could plan further moves.\n   - **UP** (`(5, 3)`): This doesn't bring me closer to any immediate apples.\n   - **DOWN** (`(5, 1)`): This moves me one step closer to the apple at `(5, 0)`.\n   - **RIGHT** (`(6, 2)`): Going right would just lead back to my last position, which isn't optimal.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment and Safety**:\n   - Snake #2 is far away, so I don\u2019t need to worry about colliding with it for now.\n   - The area around me is clear, though I should remain aware of my growing body as I continue eating apples.\n\n5. **Considered Path and Strategy**:\n   - Moving LEFT to `(4, 2)` positions me better to go after the apple at `(4, 1)`.\n   - Moving DOWN to `(5, 1)` makes sense for targeting the apple at `(5, 0)`, and it sets me up to perhaps turn left next for the `(4, 1)` apple.\n\n6. **Plan**:\n   - First, I'll move DOWN towards `(5, 0)`. It's a closer apple, within a clear path without backtracking.\n   - After reaching `(5, 0)`, I\u2019ll consider moving left or right towards other apples based on the board state.\n\n7. **Long-term Strategy**:\n   - Balance immediate apple consumption with position optimization. Keep options open for following apples while avoiding risky moves.\n\n**Conclusion and Decided Move**:\n\nTo reach the apple at `(5, 0)`, I'll move DOWN. This approach places me closer to the apple and sets up subsequent strategic moves.\n\nDecided Move: DOWN"

Given the current board state, there are no bodies, walls, or enemies at that tile.\n   - Monitor Snake #2, though it is distant, it could be moving toward future target apples.\n\n6. **Strategic Considerations for Next Turn**:\n   - After consuming the apple at `(8, 6)`, consider new targets. The apples at `(5, 0)` and `(2, 7)` will need reassessment.\n   - Staying flexible is key, considering Snake #2\u2019s move pattern to avoid any future contest over apples.\n\n**Conclusion and Decided Move**:\n- Move **UP** to consume the apple at `(8, 6)`. This places me in an advantageous position with a continuous plan to target additional apples while remaining cautious of other snakes and the board edges.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy**:\n- After consuming the apple, reassess the board to determine the optimal next target among remaining apples, factoring in distance and potential threats.\n\n**Decided Move**: UP"

I need to evaluate which apple I should pursue next based on distance and safety.\n\n2. **Distance to Apples**:\n   - The apple at `(9, 3)` is relatively close since it's to the right and slightly downwards.\n   - The apples `(0, 1)` and `(1, 1)` are farthest but grouped. It's advisable to consider them if moving to that zone promises a chain of apple consumption with minimal risk.\n   - The apple at `(5, 0)` requires moving diagonally downwards, crossing several empty spaces.\n   - The apple at `(2, 9)` is very far, and pursuing it directly could risk a run-in with Snake #2.\n\n3. **Immediate Strategy**:\n   - I want to maintain flexibility and minimize immediate risks.
