I have to ensure I do not fall into a trap since my next moves should not lead me nearer to them.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIt would be preferable to rotate LEFT to (3, 8), as it allows me to explore a new segment of the board without moving closer to the enemy. However, this might not prove immediately fruitful in terms of points.\n\n### Decision:\nI will move LEFT to (3, 8).\n\nNext Move: **LEFT**"

Among the valid moves:\n\n- **Moving DOWN (to 3, 7)** allows me to stay in the middle and assess my next options without moving back or risking proximity to the enemy snake.\n- Post moving down, I can evaluate moving right towards the apple at (6, 3) or manoeuver towards the other apples, considering the enemy snake\u2019s position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo keep up momentum on the board and avoid clashing with the enemy\u2019s territory while exploring potential avenues, I will proceed with **DOWN to (3, 7)**.\n\nNext Move: **DOWN**"
