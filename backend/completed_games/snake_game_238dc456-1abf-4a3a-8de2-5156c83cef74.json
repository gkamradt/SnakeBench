However, if I go DOWN, I will avoid the enemy while still keeping potential moves to gather apples in future turns.\n\nTo maximize my points, I should prioritize moves that keep me safe while also getting closer to apples. The apple at (3, 6) is relatively close, and moving RIGHT to (2, 3) would position me well for that apple in the following turn.\n\nAfter considering everything, my best move at the moment is:\n\nRIGHT."
