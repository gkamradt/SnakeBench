The next immediate goals are to secure more apples, specifically those at coordinates (4, 7) and (3, 7). These make them prime targets in the upward (northern) region of the board, which encourages a movement strategy directed more north and west.\n\nKey Decision Points:\n1. Moving UP increases the distance between my snake and the nearest apple targets directly, therefore I should consider moves that orient towards the northwest.\n2. Moving LEFT doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apple immediately but sets up a potential path for future turns towards (4, 7) and (3, 7).\n3. Moving RIGHT or DOWN does not align with the goal of getting more apples and could place me in a less strategic position.\n4. Snake #2 is positioned far to the south at (7, 2), reducing any immediate threat of collision, allowing focus on apple collection.\n\nStrategical Evaluation:\n- Continuing UP offers a straightforward approach towards (4, 7) and (3, 7). However, this might make it slightly longer to reach said apples since I'll have to depend on subsequent LEFT moves which are time-delaying.\n- Choosing LEFT this turn might make reaching the (4, 7) apple more direct on later turns, as I\u2019ll be aligned on the same x-coordinate. \n\nShort-term strategy for next turn:\nAfter moving LEFT this turn, I will aim to move UP on the subsequent turns unless obstacles or enemy movements dictate otherwise.

This path is longer and potentially brings my snake closer to the north boundary.\n- (5, 3) is far down and to the left (southwest), which would take multiple moves and won't optimally increase my score quickly given the more direct apple opportunities.  \n- (2, 3) and (2, 4) are both located much further south and to the west, making them less attractive options due to the number of moves required and the proximity to the board's edges, increasing the risk of collision.\n\nBy moving LEFT to (7, 6), I can quickly score a point and then reassess the board for the next move, possibly positioning myself to go for the apple at (4, 7) next or heading further down if the path remains clear. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

Moving UP increases the distance between my snake and the nearest apple targets directly, therefore I should consider moves that orient towards the northwest.\n2. Moving LEFT doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apple immediately but sets up a potential path for future turns towards (4, 7) and (3, 7).\n3.

This simplicity lowers the chance of error.\n\nThe other apples are positioned as follows:\n- (4, 7) is to the northwest but requires a movement upwards and several spaces left. This path is longer and potentially brings my snake closer to the north boundary.\n- (5, 3) is far down and to the left (southwest), which would take multiple moves and won't optimally increase my score quickly given the more direct apple opportunities.  \n- (2, 3) and (2, 4) are both located much further south and to the west, making them less attractive options due to the number of moves required and the proximity to the board's edges, increasing the risk of collision.\n\nBy moving LEFT to (7, 6), I can quickly score a point and then reassess the board for the next move, possibly positioning myself to go for the apple at (4, 7) next or heading further down if the path remains clear. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

Moving DOWN to (1, 6) keeps me on track to approach the cluster of apples at (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4) from the right, allowing further strategic plays in subsequent turns.\n\nRationale and Long-Term Strategy:\n- Because I have another apple (2, 2) closer to my current head position compared to any other, aiming DOWN from (1, 7) to (1, 6) aligns me favorably to reach this apple, as well as maintaining flexibility to subsequently capture (2, 3) and (2, 4).\n- It's crucial to keep an eye on enemy Snake #2 at (4, 3) with a body at [(5, 3)], but currently, this snake doesn't pose an immediate threat to the targeted apples.\n- The ongoing strategy will be to consistently aim towards apple-rich regions while cautiously ensuring no direct path leads into a collision with myself or the walls, especially as the snake grows longer.\n\nNext moves to Consider:\n- Continue to evaluate the position of enemy snakes in relation to available apples.\n- Prioritize securing apples while maintaining a safe distance from hazards.\n\nDecided Next Move: DOWN."

This simplicity lowers the chance of error.\n\nThe other apples are positioned as follows:\n- (4, 7) is to the northwest but requires a movement upwards and several spaces left. This path is longer and potentially brings my snake closer to the north boundary.\n- (5, 3) is far down and to the left (southwest), which would take multiple moves and won't optimally increase my score quickly given the more direct apple opportunities.  \n- (2, 3) and (2, 4) are both located much further south and to the west, making them less attractive options due to the number of moves required and the proximity to the board's edges, increasing the risk of collision.\n\nBy moving LEFT to (7, 6), I can quickly score a point and then reassess the board for the next move, possibly positioning myself to go for the apple at (4, 7) next or heading further down if the path remains clear. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

Moving DOWN to (2,4) allows me to collect an apple this turn and positions me to collect another on the following turn.\n- Continue monitoring the path and potential expansion of Snake #2 to ensure it does not interfere with upcoming moves.\n- After collecting the apple at (2,4), aim next to move further DOWN to (2,3) to collect the next apple and maintain a focus on vertical movements within this column as it is abundant in resources.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: DOWN. This maximizes the opportunity for growth and point accumulation while maintaining a safe strategic path. This choice keeps the snake on a successful apple-collecting trajectory and avoids unnecessary risks."

The apple at (4, 8) seems to be the next best target, but I will need to navigate around the enemy snake #1. I will continue to prioritize apples that are not blocked by enemy snakes to ensure my survival and growth.\n\nNext move: UP"

This is an excellent next target for growth.\n  - Other apples at (4, 8), (6, 7), and (5, 2) are currently distant and would require careful navigation through or around potential obstacles in subsequent moves.\n\n- **Strategic Planning**:\n  1. Secure the immediately accessible apple at (5, 6) by moving LEFT. \n  2. Post collection, consider navigating UP to collect the apple at (6, 7).\n  3. Continue to remain vigilant of the movements of Snake #2 and of any potential spatial challenges due to my growing length.\n\n**Safety Checks**:\n- Ensure no potential for collision with the body as it grows from consuming more apples.\n- Continue monitoring the enemy snake\u2019s path and positional changes.\n\n**Immediate Next Move Decision**:\n- **Move LEFT** to safely and efficiently reach and consume the apple located at (5, 6).\n\n**Strategize for Subsequent Move**:\n- After moving LEFT, plan for the next move to potentially be UP to reach the next nearest apple at (6, 7), keeping in mind the safety from any boundaries or the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: LEFT."

This apple is a potential secondary target as the snake could proceed to this position after collecting the apple at (5, 8).\n\n- **Strategic Considerations**:\n  1. Continue UP to reach the apple at (5, 8) but staying alert for any new obstacles or changes in enemy trajectory.\n  2. After collecting the apple, turn RIGHT to aim for the apple at (6, 7). This move should be further verified at that future point considering the conditions surrounding the snake after the up move.\n  3. Monitoring the potential collision risks from my own growing snake body and enemy paths is a must.\n\n**Immediate Next Move Decision**:\n- **Move UP** to capture the apple at (5, 8). This is a straight and safe path as per the last reported positions and requires no immediate redirection post-capture.\n\n**Strategize for Subsequent Move**:\n- After ascending and reaching (5, 8), I plan to reassess the board with the view of potentially moving RIGHT to head for the next closest apple at (6, 7). \n\n**Decided Next Move**: UP."
