Moving towards it maximizes the chances of collecting points efficiently.\n- **Avoiding Risks:** Moving UP might risk colliding with your own tail, while moving LEFT or DOWN doesn't present immediate threats but also doesn't optimize apple collection.\n- **Maintaining Flexibility:** By moving RIGHT, you keep open paths for future moves, reducing the likelihood of getting trapped as the snake grows.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**  \nAfter collecting the apple at (7, 6), reassess the board to prioritize the next closest apple while ensuring there's ample space to maneuver.

Additionally, it positions me favorably for future moves towards (3, 5).\n\n## Strategic Thoughts:\n- **Left or Right?**:\n   - Moving to (2, 8) is not only a valid move but will put me on an apple, allowing me to score a point. Following that, I will then have additional options for maneuvering toward the apple at (3, 5).\n   - Moving to (0, 8) does not yield immediate growth and does not advance me toward the more fruitful position next.\n\nConsidering the importance of positioning and growth, **the best immediate move is to the right (to (2, 8))** to collect the apple.\n\n## Decided Next Move:\nRIGHT"
