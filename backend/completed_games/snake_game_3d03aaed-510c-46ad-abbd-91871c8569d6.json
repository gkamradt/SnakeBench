If I move up towards the apple at (5, 8), I may potentially run into the enemy snake's head.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (8, 6), which is five steps to the right and one step down from my current position. This would take me further away from the enemy snake for now, but it's not the closest apple.\n\nConsidering the positions of the apples and the enemy snake, I think the safer strategy would be to move towards the apple at (4, 3) for now, as it's the second closest apple and takes me away from the immediate path of the enemy snake.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Evaluate the updated positions of the enemy snake and the remaining apples, and try to move towards the closest apple while avoiding collisions and potentially setting up for future moves towards other apples."
