It's important to monitor any movements, especially since they may decide to move toward any of the remaining apples.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- Considering that collecting more apples without risking collision is crucial, approaching the apple at (8, 9) seems a feasible next target. This pathway maintains a distance from the enemy snake and shuns the board's boundaries, reducing the risk of accidental self-collision or running out of board space.\n\n**Immediate Next Move:**\n- A strategic shift to UP aiming towards the apple at (8, 9) by first moving UP to (9, 8), and subsequently LEFT the following turn if conditions remain favorable.\n\n**Strategy for Following Moves:**\n- After obtaining the apple at (8, 9), reassess the state of the board. If uncontested, moving further DOWN towards the apple at (7, 2) could be considered.\n- Continue monitoring the enemy snake's position to adapt the path and ensure our snake's safety.\n\n**Decision:**\n- **Next move: UP** This allows positioning to either go LEFT next for (8, 9) or adjust based on the enemy's movement or other changes in the game scenario. Proceed with this cautious yet advancing move."
