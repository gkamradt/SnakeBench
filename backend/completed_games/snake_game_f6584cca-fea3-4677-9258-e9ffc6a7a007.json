This apple is the closest one to my current position, and moving up will not put me in danger of running into the enemy snake or the walls.\n\nBy moving UP, I can potentially gain an additional point by eating the apple, which would give me the advantage over the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: UP."

The closest apple to us is at (0, 4), which is to our left. We also have an apple at (1, 3) and another at (1, 0), but they are not directly accessible from our current position.\n\nOur enemy snake, #1, is at position (8, 9), which is far away from us, so we don't need to worry about it for now.\n\nConsidering the rules, our goal is to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions with the wall, other snakes, and ourselves.\n\nFor now, I think the best strategy is to move towards the closest apple at (0, 4). We can do this by decreasing our x-coordinate.\n\nNext turn, I'll reassess the situation and consider moving towards other apples or avoiding potential collisions.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
