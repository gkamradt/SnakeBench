The apple at (9, 8) is far to the right, potentially a target for later progression.\n- Moving downward is risky due to the presence of enemy snake #1's body part directly in the predicted down path.\n- Moving right opens potential to reposition for a future move towards the central or right side of the board where most apples are clustered.\n\nImmediate plan:\n- Shifting right allows repositioning while staying on the safe side, moving away from direct confrontations, and potentially plotting a path towards denser apple regions.\n\nNext Move Strategy:\n- After moving to the right, evaluate positions relative to nearby apples, and, based on the enemy snake's position, choose whether to advance towards the upper or lower section of the board.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
