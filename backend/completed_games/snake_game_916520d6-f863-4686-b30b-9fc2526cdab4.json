          },
          "2": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2 at (4,7). The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). The board is 10x10. My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples might be (0,2) and (0,1), but they're on the left side. From (4,7), moving left would take me towards x=0. But that's a bit far. Alternatively, (9,6) is on the top right. Hmm. Let's calculate distances.\n\nCurrent position is (4,7). To get to (9,6): the x distance is 5 (right), y distance is -1 (down). So total steps: 5 + 1 = 6. But moving right and down. But moving right would take me towards x=9. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, (0,2) is x=0, y=2. From (4,7), moving left 4 steps and down 5 steps. That's 9 steps. That's a lot. (0,1) is even lower in y. (3,0) is x=3, y=0. So from (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. That's 8 steps. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. So right 3, down 7. 10 steps. Hmm. So the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,6) with 6 steps. Then (0,2) is 4+5=9 steps. Wait, wait, Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So (9,6) is |4-9| + |7-6| = 5 +1=6. (0,2) is |4-0| + |7-2|=4+5=9. (3,0) is |4-3| + |7-0|=1+7=8. (7,0) is 3+7=10. (0,1) is 4+6=10. So (9,6) is the closest. So maybe I should go for that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (9,2). So if I go towards (9,6), I might be moving into the same area as the enemy. But since both snakes are just heads, maybe collision isn't an issue unless we move into each other. But right now, the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (9,6). So maybe that's safe.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (9,6). Let's see the path. From (4,7), to get to (9,6), I need to move right and down. But which direction first? Let's see possible moves. From (4,7), possible directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). So if I go RIGHT to (5,7), then next steps can continue right towards x=9, then down. Alternatively, go DOWN to (4,6), then right. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, then next move can be RIGHT again, and so on. But (9,6) is at y=6, so from (4,7), moving down would get me closer in y. Wait, (4,7) to (9,6): the x difference is 5, y difference is 1. So moving right 5 times and down once. But the order matters. Alternatively, moving down first to (4,6), then right 5 times. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving right first is better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The board shows that at (9,6) there's an apple. The enemy snake is at (9,2), which is in column 9, row 2. So moving to (9,6) is safe as long as the enemy isn't moving up. But since the enemy is at (9,2), their possible moves could be up, down, left, or right. But they might be going for apples as well. However, since they are at (9,2), the closest apple for them might be (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe they'll go for (9,6) as well. But that's a possibility. But since I'm starting at (4,7), I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves. The enemy is at (9,2), so to reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times, which would take 4 moves. So if I start moving towards (9,6) now, I can get there in 6 moves, while the enemy can get there in 4. So maybe they can reach it first. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe (9,6) is not the best target because the enemy can get there faster. So perhaps I should consider another apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,2) is at (0,2). From my position (4,7), moving left 4 and down 5. That's 9 steps. The enemy is at (9,2). To get to (0,2), they need to move left 9 steps (from x=9 to x=0), same y. So that's 9 steps. So if I go for (0,2), the enemy would take 9 steps, same as me. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, (0,1) is even lower. But that's 10 steps for me. (3,0) is 8 steps. (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is 8 steps. Let's see. (3,0) is at x=3, y=0. From (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 8. So that's the next closest. But moving down 7 steps would take me to the bottom of the board. Let's see the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down each step. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down first. But maybe there's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) but that's 9 steps. But perhaps the enemy is not going for that. Alternatively, maybe (3,0) is better. Let's see. If I go for (3,0), the path would be left once, then down 7 times. But moving down 7 steps from (3,7) to (3,0). But that's a straight line. But during that path, are there any apples? The apples at (3,0) is the target, and (7,0) is another. So maybe that's a possible path. But moving down so much might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area. But the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (3,0). So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (0,1) or (0,2), but those are on the left edge. Let's check the board again. The board shows that at (0,2) and (0,1) there are apples. So if I can reach those, but the path is long. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for (9,6), which is closer to them. So perhaps I can go for (3,0) or (7,0). Let's compare (3,0) and (7,0). (3,0) is 8 steps, (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is better. So maybe I should head towards (3,0). Let's plan the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down to (3,6), (3,5), etc., until (3,0). That's 7 steps down. But that's a straight line. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and their body is empty, they can't block me. So the path is clear. So moving left first to (3,7), then down. But wait, the first move is from (4,7). So possible directions: LEFT to (3,7), DOWN to (4,6), RIGHT to (5,7), or UP to (4,8). But UP would take me to (4,8), which is within the board. But why go up? Maybe not necessary. So if I want to go to (3,0), the first move should be LEFT. Then proceed down. But let's check if moving left is safe. The current position is (4,7). Moving left to (3,7). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (9,2), so (3,7) is safe. So moving left is okay. Then next move down to (3,6), and so on. So the first move would be LEFT. But wait, the apple at (3,0) is in column 3, row 0. So that's a long way down. But maybe that's a safer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then left again to (2,7), etc. But that's a lot of left moves. Then down. But that's 4 lefts and 5 downs. So 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards other apples. But perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to go for the closest apple, which is (9,6), even though the enemy might reach it first. But if I can get there before them, or if they are not going for it, then it's worth it. Let's calculate again. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times. So 4 moves. I'm at (4,7). To reach (9,6), I need to move right 5 times and down once. So 6 moves. So the enemy can get there in 4 moves, which is faster. So if they are going for that apple, they will get it first. So maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. So (3,0) is 8 moves. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (3,0), they need to move left 6 and down 2. So 8 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (0,2) or (0,1). So perhaps (3,0) is a better target. Let's proceed towards (3,0). So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. But wait, after moving left, the next move would be DOWN. So the first move is LEFT. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see. If I move DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6), then I can start moving left. But that would take me closer to (3,0) in a different way. Let's compare the paths. If I go LEFT first, then down, the path is (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). If I go DOWN first, then left, the path is (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). Either way, same number of steps. But moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first could be better if there's a reason. But I don't see any obstacles. So maybe LEFT is better. So first move LEFT. Then down. But wait, after moving LEFT to (3,7), the next move can be DOWN to (3,6), then continue down. So that's the path. So the first move is LEFT. But let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,7). Then next move DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). So along the path to (3,0), there are no other apples. So the only apple is at (3,0). So that's the target. So moving LEFT first is okay. Alternatively, maybe I should go for (0,2) but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (7,0). Let's see. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. From (4,7), moving right 3 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 10. That's further. So not ideal. So (3,0) is better. So the plan is to move LEFT towards (3,0). But wait, another thought: if I move LEFT now, I can start heading towards (3,0), but maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left 4 times to (0,7), then down 5 times to (0,2). That's 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards (0,2) as well. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (0,2), they need to move left 9 times. So 9 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (9,6). So perhaps (0,2) is a safer target. But it's a longer path. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think about possible risks. If I go for (9,6), the enemy might reach it first, and then I would have wasted moves. If I go for (3,0), the enemy might not be going there, so I can get it. If I go for (0,2), same risk. So maybe (3,0) is the best option. Let's proceed with that. So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, the snake's body is empty, so there's no risk of running into itself. The only risks are walls, other snakes, or their own body. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and I'm moving to (3,7), which is safe. So moving LEFT is safe. So the direction is LEFT. But wait, let's check the board again. The board shows that at (3,0) there's an apple. So moving towards that. So yes, LEFT is the first step. Then down. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, another consideration: after moving LEFT, the next move would be DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? No, the apples are at (3,0), so only when I reach there. So the plan is to move LEFT. So the answer is LEFT. But wait, let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (3,7), then next move can be DOWN to (3,6), and so on. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (3,0) by moving left first, then down. This path avoids immediate competition and uses the shortest distance among available apples. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples might be (0,2) and (0,1), but they're on the left side. From (4,7), moving left would take me towards x=0. But that's a bit far. Alternatively, (9,6) is on the top right. Hmm. Let's calculate distances.\n\nCurrent position is (4,7). To get to (9,6): the x distance is 5 (right), y distance is -1 (down). So total steps: 5 + 1 = 6. But moving right and down. But moving right would take me towards x=9. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, (0,2) is x=0, y=2. From (4,7), moving left 4 steps and down 5 steps. That's 9 steps. That's a lot. (0,1) is even lower in y. (3,0) is x=3, y=0. So from (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. That's 8 steps. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. So right 3, down 7. 10 steps. Hmm. So the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,6) with 6 steps. Then (0,2) is 4+5=9 steps. Wait, wait, Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So (9,6) is |4-9| + |7-6| = 5 +1=6. (0,2) is |4-0| + |7-2|=4+5=9. (3,0) is |4-3| + |7-0|=1+7=8. (7,0) is 3+7=10. (0,1) is 4+6=10. So (9,6) is the closest. So maybe I should go for that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (9,2). So if I go towards (9,6), I might be moving into the same area as the enemy. But since both snakes are just heads, maybe collision isn't an issue unless we move into each other. But right now, the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (9,6). So maybe that's safe.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (9,6). Let's see the path. From (4,7), to get to (9,6), I need to move right and down. But which direction first? Let's see possible moves. From (4,7), possible directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). So if I go RIGHT to (5,7), then next steps can continue right towards x=9, then down. Alternatively, go DOWN to (4,6), then right. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, then next move can be RIGHT again, and so on. But (9,6) is at y=6, so from (4,7), moving down would get me closer in y. Wait, (4,7) to (9,6): the x difference is 5, y difference is 1. So moving right 5 times and down once. But the order matters. Alternatively, moving down first to (4,6), then right 5 times. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving right first is better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The board shows that at (9,6) there's an apple. The enemy snake is at (9,2), which is in column 9, row 2. So moving to (9,6) is safe as long as the enemy isn't moving up. But since the enemy is at (9,2), their possible moves could be up, down, left, or right. But they might be going for apples as well. However, since they are at (9,2), the closest apple for them might be (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe they'll go for (9,6) as well. But that's a possibility. But since I'm starting at (4,7), I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves. The enemy is at (9,2), so to reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times, which would take 4 moves. So if I start moving towards (9,6) now, I can get there in 6 moves, while the enemy can get there in 4. So maybe they can reach it first. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe (9,6) is not the best target because the enemy can get there faster. So perhaps I should consider another apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,2) is at (0,2). From my position (4,7), moving left 4 and down 5. That's 9 steps. The enemy is at (9,2). To get to (0,2), they need to move left 9 steps (from x=9 to x=0), same y. So that's 9 steps. So if I go for (0,2), the enemy would take 9 steps, same as me. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, (0,1) is even lower. But that's 10 steps for me. (3,0) is 8 steps. (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is 8 steps. Let's see. (3,0) is at x=3, y=0. From (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 8. So that's the next closest. But moving down 7 steps would take me to the bottom of the board. Let's see the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down each step. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down first. But maybe there's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) but that's 9 steps. But perhaps the enemy is not going for that. Alternatively, maybe (3,0) is better. Let's see. If I go for (3,0), the path would be left once, then down 7 times. But moving down 7 steps from (3,7) to (3,0). But that's a straight line. But during that path, are there any apples? The apples at (3,0) is the target, and (7,0) is another. So maybe that's a possible path. But moving down so much might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area. But the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (3,0). So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (0,1) or (0,2), but those are on the left edge. Let's check the board again. The board shows that at (0,2) and (0,1) there are apples. So if I can reach those, but the path is long. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for (9,6), which is closer to them. So perhaps I can go for (3,0) or (7,0). Let's compare (3,0) and (7,0). (3,0) is 8 steps, (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is better. So maybe I should head towards (3,0). Let's plan the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down to (3,6), (3,5), etc., until (3,0). That's 7 steps down. But that's a straight line. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and their body is empty, they can't block me. So the path is clear. So moving left first to (3,7), then down. But wait, the first move is from (4,7). So possible directions: LEFT to (3,7), DOWN to (4,6), RIGHT to (5,7), or UP to (4,8). But UP would take me to (4,8), which is within the board. But why go up? Maybe not necessary. So if I want to go to (3,0), the first move should be LEFT. Then proceed down. But let's check if moving left is safe. The current position is (4,7). Moving left to (3,7). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (9,2), so (3,7) is safe. So moving left is okay. Then next move down to (3,6), and so on. So the first move would be LEFT. But wait, the apple at (3,0) is in column 3, row 0. So that's a long way down. But maybe that's a safer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then left again to (2,7), etc. But that's a lot of left moves. Then down. But that's 4 lefts and 5 downs. So 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards other apples. But perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to go for the closest apple, which is (9,6), even though the enemy might reach it first. But if I can get there before them, or if they are not going for it, then it's worth it. Let's calculate again. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times. So 4 moves. I'm at (4,7). To reach (9,6), I need to move right 5 times and down once. So 6 moves. So the enemy can get there in 4 moves, which is faster. So if they are going for that apple, they will get it first. So maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. So (3,0) is 8 moves. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (3,0), they need to move left 6 and down 2. So 8 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (0,2) or (0,1). So perhaps (3,0) is a better target. Let's proceed towards (3,0). So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. But wait, after moving left, the next move would be DOWN. So the first move is LEFT. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see. If I move DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6), then I can start moving left. But that would take me closer to (3,0) in a different way. Let's compare the paths. If I go LEFT first, then down, the path is (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). If I go DOWN first, then left, the path is (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). Either way, same number of steps. But moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first could be better if there's a reason. But I don't see any obstacles. So maybe LEFT is better. So first move LEFT. Then down. But wait, after moving LEFT to (3,7), the next move can be DOWN to (3,6), then continue down. So that's the path. So the first move is LEFT. But let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,7). Then next move DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). So along the path to (3,0), there are no other apples. So the only apple is at (3,0). So that's the target. So moving LEFT first is okay. Alternatively, maybe I should go for (0,2) but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (7,0). Let's see. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. From (4,7), moving right 3 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 10. That's further. So not ideal. So (3,0) is better. So the plan is to move LEFT towards (3,0). But wait, another thought: if I move LEFT now, I can start heading towards (3,0), but maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left 4 times to (0,7), then down 5 times to (0,2). That's 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards (0,2) as well. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (0,2), they need to move left 9 times. So 9 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (9,6). So perhaps (0,2) is a safer target. But it's a longer path. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think about possible risks. If I go for (9,6), the enemy might reach it first, and then I would have wasted moves. If I go for (3,0), the enemy might not be going there, so I can get it. If I go for (0,2), same risk. So maybe (3,0) is the best option. Let's proceed with that. So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, the snake's body is empty, so there's no risk of running into itself. The only risks are walls, other snakes, or their own body. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and I'm moving to (3,7), which is safe. So moving LEFT is safe. So the direction is LEFT. But wait, let's check the board again. The board shows that at (3,0) there's an apple. So moving towards that. So yes, LEFT is the first step. Then down. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, another consideration: after moving LEFT, the next move would be DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? No, the apples are at (3,0), so only when I reach there. So the plan is to move LEFT. So the answer is LEFT. But wait, let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (3,7), then next move can be DOWN to (3,6), and so on. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (3,0) by moving left first, then down. This path avoids immediate competition and uses the shortest distance among available apples. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2 at (4,7). The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). The board is 10x10. My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples might be (0,2) and (0,1), but they're on the left side. From (4,7), moving left would take me towards x=0. But that's a bit far. Alternatively, (9,6) is on the top right. Hmm. Let's calculate distances.\n\nCurrent position is (4,7). To get to (9,6): the x distance is 5 (right), y distance is -1 (down). So total steps: 5 + 1 = 6. But moving right and down. But moving right would take me towards x=9. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, (0,2) is x=0, y=2. From (4,7), moving left 4 steps and down 5 steps. That's 9 steps. That's a lot. (0,1) is even lower in y. (3,0) is x=3, y=0. So from (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. That's 8 steps. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. So right 3, down 7. 10 steps. Hmm. So the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,6) with 6 steps. Then (0,2) is 4+5=9 steps. Wait, wait, Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So (9,6) is |4-9| + |7-6| = 5 +1=6. (0,2) is |4-0| + |7-2|=4+5=9. (3,0) is |4-3| + |7-0|=1+7=8. (7,0) is 3+7=10. (0,1) is 4+6=10. So (9,6) is the closest. So maybe I should go for that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (9,2). So if I go towards (9,6), I might be moving into the same area as the enemy. But since both snakes are just heads, maybe collision isn't an issue unless we move into each other. But right now, the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (9,6). So maybe that's safe.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (9,6). Let's see the path. From (4,7), to get to (9,6), I need to move right and down. But which direction first? Let's see possible moves. From (4,7), possible directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). So if I go RIGHT to (5,7), then next steps can continue right towards x=9, then down. Alternatively, go DOWN to (4,6), then right. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, then next move can be RIGHT again, and so on. But (9,6) is at y=6, so from (4,7), moving down would get me closer in y. Wait, (4,7) to (9,6): the x difference is 5, y difference is 1. So moving right 5 times and down once. But the order matters. Alternatively, moving down first to (4,6), then right 5 times. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving right first is better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The board shows that at (9,6) there's an apple. The enemy snake is at (9,2), which is in column 9, row 2. So moving to (9,6) is safe as long as the enemy isn't moving up. But since the enemy is at (9,2), their possible moves could be up, down, left, or right. But they might be going for apples as well. However, since they are at (9,2), the closest apple for them might be (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe they'll go for (9,6) as well. But that's a possibility. But since I'm starting at (4,7), I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves. The enemy is at (9,2), so to reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times, which would take 4 moves. So if I start moving towards (9,6) now, I can get there in 6 moves, while the enemy can get there in 4. So maybe they can reach it first. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe (9,6) is not the best target because the enemy can get there faster. So perhaps I should consider another apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,2) is at (0,2). From my position (4,7), moving left 4 and down 5. That's 9 steps. The enemy is at (9,2). To get to (0,2), they need to move left 9 steps (from x=9 to x=0), same y. So that's 9 steps. So if I go for (0,2), the enemy would take 9 steps, same as me. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, (0,1) is even lower. But that's 10 steps for me. (3,0) is 8 steps. (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is 8 steps. Let's see. (3,0) is at x=3, y=0. From (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 8. So that's the next closest. But moving down 7 steps would take me to the bottom of the board. Let's see the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down each step. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down first. But maybe there's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) but that's 9 steps. But perhaps the enemy is not going for that. Alternatively, maybe (3,0) is better. Let's see. If I go for (3,0), the path would be left once, then down 7 times. But moving down 7 steps from (3,7) to (3,0). But that's a straight line. But during that path, are there any apples? The apples at (3,0) is the target, and (7,0) is another. So maybe that's a possible path. But moving down so much might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area. But the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (3,0). So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (0,1) or (0,2), but those are on the left edge. Let's check the board again. The board shows that at (0,2) and (0,1) there are apples. So if I can reach those, but the path is long. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for (9,6), which is closer to them. So perhaps I can go for (3,0) or (7,0). Let's compare (3,0) and (7,0). (3,0) is 8 steps, (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is better. So maybe I should head towards (3,0). Let's plan the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down to (3,6), (3,5), etc., until (3,0). That's 7 steps down. But that's a straight line. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and their body is empty, they can't block me. So the path is clear. So moving left first to (3,7), then down. But wait, the first move is from (4,7). So possible directions: LEFT to (3,7), DOWN to (4,6), RIGHT to (5,7), or UP to (4,8). But UP would take me to (4,8), which is within the board. But why go up? Maybe not necessary. So if I want to go to (3,0), the first move should be LEFT. Then proceed down. But let's check if moving left is safe. The current position is (4,7). Moving left to (3,7). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (9,2), so (3,7) is safe. So moving left is okay. Then next move down to (3,6), and so on. So the first move would be LEFT. But wait, the apple at (3,0) is in column 3, row 0. So that's a long way down. But maybe that's a safer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then left again to (2,7), etc. But that's a lot of left moves. Then down. But that's 4 lefts and 5 downs. So 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards other apples. But perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to go for the closest apple, which is (9,6), even though the enemy might reach it first. But if I can get there before them, or if they are not going for it, then it's worth it. Let's calculate again. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times. So 4 moves. I'm at (4,7). To reach (9,6), I need to move right 5 times and down once. So 6 moves. So the enemy can get there in 4 moves, which is faster. So if they are going for that apple, they will get it first. So maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. So (3,0) is 8 moves. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (3,0), they need to move left 6 and down 2. So 8 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (0,2) or (0,1). So perhaps (3,0) is a better target. Let's proceed towards (3,0). So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. But wait, after moving left, the next move would be DOWN. So the first move is LEFT. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see. If I move DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6), then I can start moving left. But that would take me closer to (3,0) in a different way. Let's compare the paths. If I go LEFT first, then down, the path is (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). If I go DOWN first, then left, the path is (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). Either way, same number of steps. But moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first could be better if there's a reason. But I don't see any obstacles. So maybe LEFT is better. So first move LEFT. Then down. But wait, after moving LEFT to (3,7), the next move can be DOWN to (3,6), then continue down. So that's the path. So the first move is LEFT. But let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,7). Then next move DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). So along the path to (3,0), there are no other apples. So the only apple is at (3,0). So that's the target. So moving LEFT first is okay. Alternatively, maybe I should go for (0,2) but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (7,0). Let's see. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. From (4,7), moving right 3 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 10. That's further. So not ideal. So (3,0) is better. So the plan is to move LEFT towards (3,0). But wait, another thought: if I move LEFT now, I can start heading towards (3,0), but maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left 4 times to (0,7), then down 5 times to (0,2). That's 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards (0,2) as well. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (0,2), they need to move left 9 times. So 9 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (9,6). So perhaps (0,2) is a safer target. But it's a longer path. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think about possible risks. If I go for (9,6), the enemy might reach it first, and then I would have wasted moves. If I go for (3,0), the enemy might not be going there, so I can get it. If I go for (0,2), same risk. So maybe (3,0) is the best option. Let's proceed with that. So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. So the first move is LEFT.

The enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (9,4) with an empty body.\n\nHmm, I need to decide the next move. My goal is to get to an apple without colliding. Let's check the apples again. The closest ones are (3,0) which is directly below me. From (3,6), moving down each step would take me to (3,5), (3,4), etc., until I reach (3,0). That's 6 steps down. But there's also the apple at (0,2) which is to the left. But that's further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (7,0) is to the right and down, but that's even further. The apple at (9,6) is to the right, same y-coordinate as my current position. But Snake #1 is at (9,4), which is two steps below (9,6). If I go right towards (9,6), I might have to race Snake #1. Not sure if that's safe.\n\nWait, moving towards (3,0) seems safer. Let's check possible paths. From (3,6), possible moves are UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), or RIGHT to (4,6). If I go DOWN, I continue towards (3,0). That's the most direct path. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (9,4), so they're far away. The path down is clear. \n\nBut wait, what if there's a body part I can't see? The board state shows my snake's body as empty, so no issues there. The enemy's body is also empty. So moving down again should be safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (4,6) might get me closer to the apple at (7,0) or (9,6), but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,0) is the closest. Let's stick with the plan. \n\nSo next move should be DOWN again. That takes me to (3,5), one step closer to the apple. No immediate threats in that direction. The enemy is on the other side of the board. \n\nI need to make sure I don't hit any walls. Moving down from (3,6) to (3,5) is within the 0-9 range. All good. \n\nAnother consideration: if I keep moving down, I can reach (3,0) in 6 moves. But maybe there's another apple that's better. Let me check the distances again. \n\nManhattan distance to (3,0) is |3-3| + |6-0| = 6. To (0,2): |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 +4=7. To (7,0): 4 +6=10. To (9,6): 6 +0=6. So (9,6) is same distance as (3,0). But (9,6) is to the right. If I go right, I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves (6 steps right, same y). But Snake #1 is at (9,4). If they move up, they could reach (9,6) in 2 moves. So maybe they'll get there first. So (3,0) is safer because the enemy is far away. \n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. That's the safest path towards the closest apple without competition. \n\nI should also check if moving left or right would open up other paths. Moving left to (2,6) would take me towards (0,2), but that's a longer path. Moving right to (4,6) might lead towards (7,0) but again, longer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice here. No immediate threats, and the path is clear. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue descending towards the apple at (3,0) to secure it safely without competition from the distant enemy. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

          },
          "2": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2 at (4,7). The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). The board is 10x10. My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples might be (0,2) and (0,1), but they're on the left side. From (4,7), moving left would take me towards x=0. But that's a bit far. Alternatively, (9,6) is on the top right. Hmm. Let's calculate distances.\n\nCurrent position is (4,7). To get to (9,6): the x distance is 5 (right), y distance is -1 (down). So total steps: 5 + 1 = 6. But moving right and down. But moving right would take me towards x=9. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, (0,2) is x=0, y=2. From (4,7), moving left 4 steps and down 5 steps. That's 9 steps. That's a lot. (0,1) is even lower in y. (3,0) is x=3, y=0. So from (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. That's 8 steps. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. So right 3, down 7. 10 steps. Hmm. So the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,6) with 6 steps. Then (0,2) is 4+5=9 steps. Wait, wait, Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So (9,6) is |4-9| + |7-6| = 5 +1=6. (0,2) is |4-0| + |7-2|=4+5=9. (3,0) is |4-3| + |7-0|=1+7=8. (7,0) is 3+7=10. (0,1) is 4+6=10. So (9,6) is the closest. So maybe I should go for that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (9,2). So if I go towards (9,6), I might be moving into the same area as the enemy. But since both snakes are just heads, maybe collision isn't an issue unless we move into each other. But right now, the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (9,6). So maybe that's safe.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (9,6). Let's see the path. From (4,7), to get to (9,6), I need to move right and down. But which direction first? Let's see possible moves. From (4,7), possible directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). So if I go RIGHT to (5,7), then next steps can continue right towards x=9, then down. Alternatively, go DOWN to (4,6), then right. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, then next move can be RIGHT again, and so on. But (9,6) is at y=6, so from (4,7), moving down would get me closer in y. Wait, (4,7) to (9,6): the x difference is 5, y difference is 1. So moving right 5 times and down once. But the order matters. Alternatively, moving down first to (4,6), then right 5 times. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving right first is better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The board shows that at (9,6) there's an apple. The enemy snake is at (9,2), which is in column 9, row 2. So moving to (9,6) is safe as long as the enemy isn't moving up. But since the enemy is at (9,2), their possible moves could be up, down, left, or right. But they might be going for apples as well. However, since they are at (9,2), the closest apple for them might be (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe they'll go for (9,6) as well. But that's a possibility. But since I'm starting at (4,7), I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves. The enemy is at (9,2), so to reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times, which would take 4 moves. So if I start moving towards (9,6) now, I can get there in 6 moves, while the enemy can get there in 4. So maybe they can reach it first. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe (9,6) is not the best target because the enemy can get there faster. So perhaps I should consider another apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,2) is at (0,2). From my position (4,7), moving left 4 and down 5. That's 9 steps. The enemy is at (9,2). To get to (0,2), they need to move left 9 steps (from x=9 to x=0), same y. So that's 9 steps. So if I go for (0,2), the enemy would take 9 steps, same as me. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, (0,1) is even lower. But that's 10 steps for me. (3,0) is 8 steps. (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is 8 steps. Let's see. (3,0) is at x=3, y=0. From (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 8. So that's the next closest. But moving down 7 steps would take me to the bottom of the board. Let's see the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down each step. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down first. But maybe there's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) but that's 9 steps. But perhaps the enemy is not going for that. Alternatively, maybe (3,0) is better. Let's see. If I go for (3,0), the path would be left once, then down 7 times. But moving down 7 steps from (3,7) to (3,0). But that's a straight line. But during that path, are there any apples? The apples at (3,0) is the target, and (7,0) is another. So maybe that's a possible path. But moving down so much might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area. But the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (3,0). So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (0,1) or (0,2), but those are on the left edge. Let's check the board again. The board shows that at (0,2) and (0,1) there are apples. So if I can reach those, but the path is long. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for (9,6), which is closer to them. So perhaps I can go for (3,0) or (7,0). Let's compare (3,0) and (7,0). (3,0) is 8 steps, (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is better. So maybe I should head towards (3,0). Let's plan the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down to (3,6), (3,5), etc., until (3,0). That's 7 steps down. But that's a straight line. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and their body is empty, they can't block me. So the path is clear. So moving left first to (3,7), then down. But wait, the first move is from (4,7). So possible directions: LEFT to (3,7), DOWN to (4,6), RIGHT to (5,7), or UP to (4,8). But UP would take me to (4,8), which is within the board. But why go up? Maybe not necessary. So if I want to go to (3,0), the first move should be LEFT. Then proceed down. But let's check if moving left is safe. The current position is (4,7). Moving left to (3,7). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (9,2), so (3,7) is safe. So moving left is okay. Then next move down to (3,6), and so on. So the first move would be LEFT. But wait, the apple at (3,0) is in column 3, row 0. So that's a long way down. But maybe that's a safer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then left again to (2,7), etc. But that's a lot of left moves. Then down. But that's 4 lefts and 5 downs. So 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards other apples. But perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to go for the closest apple, which is (9,6), even though the enemy might reach it first. But if I can get there before them, or if they are not going for it, then it's worth it. Let's calculate again. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times. So 4 moves. I'm at (4,7). To reach (9,6), I need to move right 5 times and down once. So 6 moves. So the enemy can get there in 4 moves, which is faster. So if they are going for that apple, they will get it first. So maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. So (3,0) is 8 moves. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (3,0), they need to move left 6 and down 2. So 8 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (0,2) or (0,1). So perhaps (3,0) is a better target. Let's proceed towards (3,0). So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. But wait, after moving left, the next move would be DOWN. So the first move is LEFT. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see. If I move DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6), then I can start moving left. But that would take me closer to (3,0) in a different way. Let's compare the paths. If I go LEFT first, then down, the path is (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). If I go DOWN first, then left, the path is (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). Either way, same number of steps. But moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first could be better if there's a reason. But I don't see any obstacles. So maybe LEFT is better. So first move LEFT. Then down. But wait, after moving LEFT to (3,7), the next move can be DOWN to (3,6), then continue down. So that's the path. So the first move is LEFT. But let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,7). Then next move DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). So along the path to (3,0), there are no other apples. So the only apple is at (3,0). So that's the target. So moving LEFT first is okay. Alternatively, maybe I should go for (0,2) but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (7,0). Let's see. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. From (4,7), moving right 3 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 10. That's further. So not ideal. So (3,0) is better. So the plan is to move LEFT towards (3,0). But wait, another thought: if I move LEFT now, I can start heading towards (3,0), but maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left 4 times to (0,7), then down 5 times to (0,2). That's 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards (0,2) as well. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (0,2), they need to move left 9 times. So 9 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (9,6). So perhaps (0,2) is a safer target. But it's a longer path. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think about possible risks. If I go for (9,6), the enemy might reach it first, and then I would have wasted moves. If I go for (3,0), the enemy might not be going there, so I can get it. If I go for (0,2), same risk. So maybe (3,0) is the best option. Let's proceed with that. So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, the snake's body is empty, so there's no risk of running into itself. The only risks are walls, other snakes, or their own body. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and I'm moving to (3,7), which is safe. So moving LEFT is safe. So the direction is LEFT. But wait, let's check the board again. The board shows that at (3,0) there's an apple. So moving towards that. So yes, LEFT is the first step. Then down. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, another consideration: after moving LEFT, the next move would be DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? No, the apples are at (3,0), so only when I reach there. So the plan is to move LEFT. So the answer is LEFT. But wait, let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (3,7), then next move can be DOWN to (3,6), and so on. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (3,0) by moving left first, then down. This path avoids immediate competition and uses the shortest distance among available apples. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (9,4) with an empty body.\n\nHmm, I need to decide the next move. My goal is to get to an apple without colliding. Let's check the apples again. The closest ones are (3,0) which is directly below me. From (3,6), moving down each step would take me to (3,5), (3,4), etc., until I reach (3,0). That's 6 steps down. But there's also the apple at (0,2) which is to the left. But that's further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (7,0) is to the right and down, but that's even further. The apple at (9,6) is to the right, same y-coordinate as my current position. But Snake #1 is at (9,4), which is two steps below (9,6). If I go right towards (9,6), I might have to race Snake #1. Not sure if that's safe.\n\nWait, moving towards (3,0) seems safer. Let's check possible paths. From (3,6), possible moves are UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), or RIGHT to (4,6).

Let's stick with the plan. \n\nSo next move should be DOWN again. That takes me to (3,5), one step closer to the apple. No immediate threats in that direction. The enemy is on the other side of the board. \n\nI need to make sure I don't hit any walls. Moving down from (3,6) to (3,5) is within the 0-9 range. All good. \n\nAnother consideration: if I keep moving down, I can reach (3,0) in 6 moves. But maybe there's another apple that's better. Let me check the distances again. \n\nManhattan distance to (3,0) is |3-3| + |6-0| = 6. To (0,2): |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 +4=7. To (7,0): 4 +6=10. To (9,6): 6 +0=6. So (9,6) is same distance as (3,0). But (9,6) is to the right. If I go right, I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves (6 steps right, same y). But Snake #1 is at (9,4). If they move up, they could reach (9,6) in 2 moves. So maybe they'll get there first. So (3,0) is safer because the enemy is far away. \n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. That's the safest path towards the closest apple without competition. \n\nI should also check if moving left or right would open up other paths. Moving left to (2,6) would take me towards (0,2), but that's a longer path. Moving right to (4,6) might lead towards (7,0) but again, longer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice here. No immediate threats, and the path is clear. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue descending towards the apple at (3,0) to secure it safely without competition from the distant enemy. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

The apples are still at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), and (0,1). The enemy snake #1 is at (9,5) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apple at (3,0) is directly below me. From (3,5), moving down each step would take me closer. The distance is 5 steps (from y=5 to y=0). The enemy snake is at (9,5), which is on the right edge. They might be heading towards the apple at (9,6) which is one up from their position. So they might move UP next. \n\nMy options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- UP to (3,6): That's moving back where I came from. Not helpful unless there's an apple, but the closest apples are below. Also, moving up would take me away from (3,0).\n- DOWN to (3,4): Continues towards (3,0). Safe as long as the path is clear. No snakes or obstacles in that column.\n- LEFT to (2,5): Moves towards the apples at (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a longer path. Also, moving left might not be the most efficient.\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Moves towards the apples at (7,0) or (9,6). But (7,0) is further, and (9,6) is on the same row but far right. However, snake #1 is at (9,5), so if I go right, I might end up in a race for (9,6). But since snake #1 is at (9,5), they can reach (9,6) in one move (UP). So if I go right, I can't get there before them. So that's risky.\n\nThe safest path is still DOWN towards (3,0). The enemy is far away, and the path is clear. No bodies or obstacles. Moving down again would take me to (3,4), getting closer. \n\nI should also check if there's any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (9,5), which is not in my path. My own body is empty, so no self-collision. Walls aren't an issue since moving down from (3,5) to (3,4) is within the 0-9 range.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples that might be closer if I change direction? The apple at (0,2) is 3 units left and 3 units up from (3,5). Manhattan distance is 6. The apple at (3,0) is 5 units down. So (3,0) is closer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple without competition. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to secure it safely. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

          "2": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2 at (4,7). The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). The board is 10x10. My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples might be (0,2) and (0,1), but they're on the left side. From (4,7), moving left would take me towards x=0. But that's a bit far. Alternatively, (9,6) is on the top right. Hmm. Let's calculate distances.\n\nCurrent position is (4,7). To get to (9,6): the x distance is 5 (right), y distance is -1 (down). So total steps: 5 + 1 = 6. But moving right and down. But moving right would take me towards x=9. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, (0,2) is x=0, y=2. From (4,7), moving left 4 steps and down 5 steps. That's 9 steps. That's a lot. (0,1) is even lower in y. (3,0) is x=3, y=0. So from (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. That's 8 steps. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. So right 3, down 7. 10 steps. Hmm. So the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,6) with 6 steps. Then (0,2) is 4+5=9 steps. Wait, wait, Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So (9,6) is |4-9| + |7-6| = 5 +1=6. (0,2) is |4-0| + |7-2|=4+5=9. (3,0) is |4-3| + |7-0|=1+7=8. (7,0) is 3+7=10. (0,1) is 4+6=10. So (9,6) is the closest. So maybe I should go for that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (9,2). So if I go towards (9,6), I might be moving into the same area as the enemy. But since both snakes are just heads, maybe collision isn't an issue unless we move into each other. But right now, the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (9,6). So maybe that's safe.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (9,6). Let's see the path. From (4,7), to get to (9,6), I need to move right and down. But which direction first? Let's see possible moves. From (4,7), possible directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). So if I go RIGHT to (5,7), then next steps can continue right towards x=9, then down. Alternatively, go DOWN to (4,6), then right. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, then next move can be RIGHT again, and so on. But (9,6) is at y=6, so from (4,7), moving down would get me closer in y. Wait, (4,7) to (9,6): the x difference is 5, y difference is 1. So moving right 5 times and down once. But the order matters. Alternatively, moving down first to (4,6), then right 5 times. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving right first is better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The board shows that at (9,6) there's an apple. The enemy snake is at (9,2), which is in column 9, row 2. So moving to (9,6) is safe as long as the enemy isn't moving up. But since the enemy is at (9,2), their possible moves could be up, down, left, or right. But they might be going for apples as well. However, since they are at (9,2), the closest apple for them might be (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe they'll go for (9,6) as well. But that's a possibility. But since I'm starting at (4,7), I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves. The enemy is at (9,2), so to reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times, which would take 4 moves. So if I start moving towards (9,6) now, I can get there in 6 moves, while the enemy can get there in 4. So maybe they can reach it first. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe (9,6) is not the best target because the enemy can get there faster. So perhaps I should consider another apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,2) is at (0,2). From my position (4,7), moving left 4 and down 5. That's 9 steps. The enemy is at (9,2). To get to (0,2), they need to move left 9 steps (from x=9 to x=0), same y. So that's 9 steps. So if I go for (0,2), the enemy would take 9 steps, same as me. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, (0,1) is even lower. But that's 10 steps for me. (3,0) is 8 steps. (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is 8 steps. Let's see. (3,0) is at x=3, y=0. From (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 8. So that's the next closest. But moving down 7 steps would take me to the bottom of the board. Let's see the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down each step. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down first. But maybe there's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) but that's 9 steps. But perhaps the enemy is not going for that. Alternatively, maybe (3,0) is better. Let's see. If I go for (3,0), the path would be left once, then down 7 times. But moving down 7 steps from (3,7) to (3,0). But that's a straight line. But during that path, are there any apples? The apples at (3,0) is the target, and (7,0) is another. So maybe that's a possible path. But moving down so much might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area. But the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (3,0). So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (0,1) or (0,2), but those are on the left edge. Let's check the board again. The board shows that at (0,2) and (0,1) there are apples. So if I can reach those, but the path is long. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for (9,6), which is closer to them. So perhaps I can go for (3,0) or (7,0). Let's compare (3,0) and (7,0). (3,0) is 8 steps, (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is better. So maybe I should head towards (3,0). Let's plan the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down to (3,6), (3,5), etc., until (3,0). That's 7 steps down. But that's a straight line. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and their body is empty, they can't block me. So the path is clear. So moving left first to (3,7), then down. But wait, the first move is from (4,7). So possible directions: LEFT to (3,7), DOWN to (4,6), RIGHT to (5,7), or UP to (4,8). But UP would take me to (4,8), which is within the board. But why go up? Maybe not necessary. So if I want to go to (3,0), the first move should be LEFT. Then proceed down. But let's check if moving left is safe. The current position is (4,7). Moving left to (3,7). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (9,2), so (3,7) is safe. So moving left is okay. Then next move down to (3,6), and so on. So the first move would be LEFT. But wait, the apple at (3,0) is in column 3, row 0. So that's a long way down. But maybe that's a safer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then left again to (2,7), etc. But that's a lot of left moves. Then down. But that's 4 lefts and 5 downs. So 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards other apples. But perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to go for the closest apple, which is (9,6), even though the enemy might reach it first. But if I can get there before them, or if they are not going for it, then it's worth it. Let's calculate again. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times. So 4 moves. I'm at (4,7). To reach (9,6), I need to move right 5 times and down once. So 6 moves. So the enemy can get there in 4 moves, which is faster. So if they are going for that apple, they will get it first. So maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. So (3,0) is 8 moves. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (3,0), they need to move left 6 and down 2. So 8 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (0,2) or (0,1). So perhaps (3,0) is a better target. Let's proceed towards (3,0). So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. But wait, after moving left, the next move would be DOWN. So the first move is LEFT. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see. If I move DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6), then I can start moving left. But that would take me closer to (3,0) in a different way. Let's compare the paths. If I go LEFT first, then down, the path is (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). If I go DOWN first, then left, the path is (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). Either way, same number of steps. But moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first could be better if there's a reason. But I don't see any obstacles. So maybe LEFT is better. So first move LEFT. Then down. But wait, after moving LEFT to (3,7), the next move can be DOWN to (3,6), then continue down. So that's the path. So the first move is LEFT. But let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,7). Then next move DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). So along the path to (3,0), there are no other apples. So the only apple is at (3,0). So that's the target. So moving LEFT first is okay. Alternatively, maybe I should go for (0,2) but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (7,0). Let's see. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. From (4,7), moving right 3 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 10. That's further. So not ideal. So (3,0) is better. So the plan is to move LEFT towards (3,0). But wait, another thought: if I move LEFT now, I can start heading towards (3,0), but maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left 4 times to (0,7), then down 5 times to (0,2). That's 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards (0,2) as well. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (0,2), they need to move left 9 times. So 9 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (9,6). So perhaps (0,2) is a safer target. But it's a longer path. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think about possible risks. If I go for (9,6), the enemy might reach it first, and then I would have wasted moves. If I go for (3,0), the enemy might not be going there, so I can get it. If I go for (0,2), same risk. So maybe (3,0) is the best option. Let's proceed with that. So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, the snake's body is empty, so there's no risk of running into itself. The only risks are walls, other snakes, or their own body. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and I'm moving to (3,7), which is safe. So moving LEFT is safe. So the direction is LEFT. But wait, let's check the board again. The board shows that at (3,0) there's an apple. So moving towards that. So yes, LEFT is the first step. Then down. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, another consideration: after moving LEFT, the next move would be DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? No, the apples are at (3,0), so only when I reach there. So the plan is to move LEFT. So the answer is LEFT. But wait, let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (3,7), then next move can be DOWN to (3,6), and so on. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (3,0) by moving left first, then down. This path avoids immediate competition and uses the shortest distance among available apples. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (9,4) with an empty body.\n\nHmm, I need to decide the next move. My goal is to get to an apple without colliding. Let's check the apples again. The closest ones are (3,0) which is directly below me. From (3,6), moving down each step would take me to (3,5), (3,4), etc., until I reach (3,0). That's 6 steps down. But there's also the apple at (0,2) which is to the left. But that's further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (7,0) is to the right and down, but that's even further. The apple at (9,6) is to the right, same y-coordinate as my current position. But Snake #1 is at (9,4), which is two steps below (9,6). If I go right towards (9,6), I might have to race Snake #1. Not sure if that's safe.\n\nWait, moving towards (3,0) seems safer. Let's check possible paths. From (3,6), possible moves are UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), or RIGHT to (4,6). If I go DOWN, I continue towards (3,0). That's the most direct path. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (9,4), so they're far away. The path down is clear. \n\nBut wait, what if there's a body part I can't see? The board state shows my snake's body as empty, so no issues there. The enemy's body is also empty. So moving down again should be safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (4,6) might get me closer to the apple at (7,0) or (9,6), but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,0) is the closest. Let's stick with the plan. \n\nSo next move should be DOWN again. That takes me to (3,5), one step closer to the apple. No immediate threats in that direction. The enemy is on the other side of the board. \n\nI need to make sure I don't hit any walls. Moving down from (3,6) to (3,5) is within the 0-9 range. All good. \n\nAnother consideration: if I keep moving down, I can reach (3,0) in 6 moves. But maybe there's another apple that's better. Let me check the distances again. \n\nManhattan distance to (3,0) is |3-3| + |6-0| = 6. To (0,2): |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 +4=7. To (7,0): 4 +6=10. To (9,6): 6 +0=6. So (9,6) is same distance as (3,0). But (9,6) is to the right. If I go right, I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves (6 steps right, same y). But Snake #1 is at (9,4). If they move up, they could reach (9,6) in 2 moves. So maybe they'll get there first. So (3,0) is safer because the enemy is far away. \n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. That's the safest path towards the closest apple without competition. \n\nI should also check if moving left or right would open up other paths.

No immediate threats, and the path is clear. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue descending towards the apple at (3,0) to secure it safely without competition from the distant enemy. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

The apples are still at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), and (0,1). The enemy snake #1 is at (9,5) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apple at (3,0) is directly below me. From (3,5), moving down each step would take me closer. The distance is 5 steps (from y=5 to y=0). The enemy snake is at (9,5), which is on the right edge. They might be heading towards the apple at (9,6) which is one up from their position. So they might move UP next. \n\nMy options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- UP to (3,6): That's moving back where I came from. Not helpful unless there's an apple, but the closest apples are below. Also, moving up would take me away from (3,0).\n- DOWN to (3,4): Continues towards (3,0). Safe as long as the path is clear. No snakes or obstacles in that column.\n- LEFT to (2,5): Moves towards the apples at (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a longer path. Also, moving left might not be the most efficient.\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Moves towards the apples at (7,0) or (9,6). But (7,0) is further, and (9,6) is on the same row but far right. However, snake #1 is at (9,5), so if I go right, I might end up in a race for (9,6). But since snake #1 is at (9,5), they can reach (9,6) in one move (UP). So if I go right, I can't get there before them. So that's risky.\n\nThe safest path is still DOWN towards (3,0). The enemy is far away, and the path is clear. No bodies or obstacles. Moving down again would take me to (3,4), getting closer. \n\nI should also check if there's any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (9,5), which is not in my path. My own body is empty, so no self-collision. Walls aren't an issue since moving down from (3,5) to (3,4) is within the 0-9 range.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples that might be closer if I change direction? The apple at (0,2) is 3 units left and 3 units up from (3,5). Manhattan distance is 6. The apple at (3,0) is 5 units down. So (3,0) is closer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice. It's the most direct path to the nearest apple without competition. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to secure it safely. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (3,4) because the last move was DOWN from (3,5) to (3,4). The apples are still at (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1), and (5,6). The enemy snake #1 is at (9,5) with a body part at (9,5), so their body is [(9,5)] now. Wait, no\u2014the initial info said their body is [(9,5)] when they were at (9,6). Wait, the current positions:\n\nWait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3,4) with body at []\". So after moving DOWN, the head is at (3,4). The enemy snake #1 is at (9,6) with body at [(9,5)]? Wait, the initial problem statement says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n* Snake #1 is at position (9, 6) with body at [(9, 5)]\"\n\nBut in the board state, the 1 is at (9,6) in row 6 (y=6), and the T is at (9,5) in row 5. So snake #1's head is at (9,6), body at (9,5). So their next move could be to move in any direction, but their body is trailing behind.\n\nMy snake is at (3,4). The apple at (3,0) is directly below me. So moving down each step would take me closer. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (3,0). That's four moves away. But there's also an apple at (0,1) and (0,2) on the left edge. However, those are further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (5,6) is at x=5, y=6. From (3,4), that's two right and two up. But that's a bit of a detour. The apple at (7,0) is at x=7, y=0. From (3,4), moving right and down. But (3,0) is closer.\n\nSo the immediate goal is to reach (3,0). Let's check possible directions:\n\n- DOWN to (3,3): That's moving towards the apple. Safe? Let's check the board. The board state shows that at row 4 (y=4), column 3 is my snake's head. The next row down (y=3) is row 3, which according to the board is empty. The enemy snake is at (9,6), so they're far away. No immediate collision risk. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nOther directions:\n\n- UP to (3,5): That's moving back up. But there's no apple there, and it's away from the target. Not useful.\n\n- LEFT to (2,4): Moving left towards the left edge. The apples at (0,1) and (0,2) are there, but that's a longer path. Also, moving left might not be efficient. But checking if there's any obstacle. The board shows row 4 (y=4) as having my snake at (3,4), and the rest of the row is empty. So moving left to (2,4) is safe, but not optimal.\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4): Moving right towards the center. The apple at (5,6) is in that direction, but again, it's a detour. Also, moving right doesn't directly lead to any immediate apple. So not the best choice.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN towards (3,0). No obstacles in the path. The enemy snake is on the other side of the board, so no immediate threat. \n\nAnother consideration: Could there be a collision with the enemy snake's next move? Snake #1 is at (9,6) with body at (9,5). They might move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (8,6), that's away from me. If they move DOWN to (9,5), that's into their own body, which would kill them. So they probably won't do that. They might move UP to (9,7), but that's outside the board (since the board is 0-9). Wait, y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So (9,6) moving UP would be (9,7), which is valid. So they could move UP, but that's towards the apple at (9,6) which is already their position. Wait, the apples listed include (9,6)? Wait, the apples are at (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1), (5,6). Oh, (5,6) is an apple. So snake #1 is at (9,6), which is not an apple. The apple at (5,6) is at x=5, y=6. So snake #1 is at (9,6), which is not an apple. So they might move towards (5,6) or other apples. But they are far from me. So their movement is unlikely to affect me in the next few steps.\n\nTherefore, continuing DOWN is the safest and most efficient path to the nearest apple. No risks detected. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to efficiently collect it without encountering threats. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2 at (4,7). The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). The board is 10x10. My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples might be (0,2) and (0,1), but they're on the left side. From (4,7), moving left would take me towards x=0. But that's a bit far. Alternatively, (9,6) is on the top right. Hmm. Let's calculate distances.\n\nCurrent position is (4,7). To get to (9,6): the x distance is 5 (right), y distance is -1 (down). So total steps: 5 + 1 = 6. But moving right and down. But moving right would take me towards x=9. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, (0,2) is x=0, y=2. From (4,7), moving left 4 steps and down 5 steps. That's 9 steps. That's a lot. (0,1) is even lower in y. (3,0) is x=3, y=0. So from (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. That's 8 steps. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. So right 3, down 7. 10 steps. Hmm. So the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,6) with 6 steps. Then (0,2) is 4+5=9 steps. Wait, wait, Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So (9,6) is |4-9| + |7-6| = 5 +1=6. (0,2) is |4-0| + |7-2|=4+5=9. (3,0) is |4-3| + |7-0|=1+7=8. (7,0) is 3+7=10. (0,1) is 4+6=10. So (9,6) is the closest. So maybe I should go for that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (9,2). So if I go towards (9,6), I might be moving into the same area as the enemy. But since both snakes are just heads, maybe collision isn't an issue unless we move into each other. But right now, the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (9,6). So maybe that's safe.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (9,6). Let's see the path. From (4,7), to get to (9,6), I need to move right and down. But which direction first? Let's see possible moves. From (4,7), possible directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). So if I go RIGHT to (5,7), then next steps can continue right towards x=9, then down. Alternatively, go DOWN to (4,6), then right. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, then next move can be RIGHT again, and so on. But (9,6) is at y=6, so from (4,7), moving down would get me closer in y. Wait, (4,7) to (9,6): the x difference is 5, y difference is 1. So moving right 5 times and down once. But the order matters. Alternatively, moving down first to (4,6), then right 5 times. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving right first is better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The board shows that at (9,6) there's an apple. The enemy snake is at (9,2), which is in column 9, row 2. So moving to (9,6) is safe as long as the enemy isn't moving up. But since the enemy is at (9,2), their possible moves could be up, down, left, or right. But they might be going for apples as well. However, since they are at (9,2), the closest apple for them might be (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe they'll go for (9,6) as well. But that's a possibility. But since I'm starting at (4,7), I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves. The enemy is at (9,2), so to reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times, which would take 4 moves. So if I start moving towards (9,6) now, I can get there in 6 moves, while the enemy can get there in 4. So maybe they can reach it first. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe (9,6) is not the best target because the enemy can get there faster. So perhaps I should consider another apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,2) is at (0,2). From my position (4,7), moving left 4 and down 5. That's 9 steps. The enemy is at (9,2). To get to (0,2), they need to move left 9 steps (from x=9 to x=0), same y. So that's 9 steps. So if I go for (0,2), the enemy would take 9 steps, same as me. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, (0,1) is even lower. But that's 10 steps for me. (3,0) is 8 steps. (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is 8 steps. Let's see. (3,0) is at x=3, y=0. From (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 8. So that's the next closest. But moving down 7 steps would take me to the bottom of the board. Let's see the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down each step. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down first. But maybe there's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) but that's 9 steps. But perhaps the enemy is not going for that. Alternatively, maybe (3,0) is better. Let's see. If I go for (3,0), the path would be left once, then down 7 times. But moving down 7 steps from (3,7) to (3,0). But that's a straight line. But during that path, are there any apples? The apples at (3,0) is the target, and (7,0) is another. So maybe that's a possible path. But moving down so much might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area. But the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (3,0). So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (0,1) or (0,2), but those are on the left edge. Let's check the board again. The board shows that at (0,2) and (0,1) there are apples. So if I can reach those, but the path is long. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for (9,6), which is closer to them. So perhaps I can go for (3,0) or (7,0). Let's compare (3,0) and (7,0). (3,0) is 8 steps, (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is better. So maybe I should head towards (3,0). Let's plan the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down to (3,6), (3,5), etc., until (3,0). That's 7 steps down. But that's a straight line. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and their body is empty, they can't block me. So the path is clear. So moving left first to (3,7), then down. But wait, the first move is from (4,7). So possible directions: LEFT to (3,7), DOWN to (4,6), RIGHT to (5,7), or UP to (4,8). But UP would take me to (4,8), which is within the board. But why go up? Maybe not necessary. So if I want to go to (3,0), the first move should be LEFT. Then proceed down. But let's check if moving left is safe. The current position is (4,7). Moving left to (3,7). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (9,2), so (3,7) is safe. So moving left is okay. Then next move down to (3,6), and so on. So the first move would be LEFT. But wait, the apple at (3,0) is in column 3, row 0. So that's a long way down. But maybe that's a safer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then left again to (2,7), etc. But that's a lot of left moves. Then down. But that's 4 lefts and 5 downs. So 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards other apples. But perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to go for the closest apple, which is (9,6), even though the enemy might reach it first. But if I can get there before them, or if they are not going for it, then it's worth it. Let's calculate again. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times. So 4 moves. I'm at (4,7). To reach (9,6), I need to move right 5 times and down once. So 6 moves. So the enemy can get there in 4 moves, which is faster. So if they are going for that apple, they will get it first. So maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. So (3,0) is 8 moves. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (3,0), they need to move left 6 and down 2. So 8 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (0,2) or (0,1). So perhaps (3,0) is a better target. Let's proceed towards (3,0). So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. But wait, after moving left, the next move would be DOWN. So the first move is LEFT. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see. If I move DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6), then I can start moving left. But that would take me closer to (3,0) in a different way. Let's compare the paths. If I go LEFT first, then down, the path is (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). If I go DOWN first, then left, the path is (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). Either way, same number of steps. But moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first could be better if there's a reason. But I don't see any obstacles. So maybe LEFT is better. So first move LEFT. Then down. But wait, after moving LEFT to (3,7), the next move can be DOWN to (3,6), then continue down. So that's the path. So the first move is LEFT. But let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,7). Then next move DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). So along the path to (3,0), there are no other apples. So the only apple is at (3,0). So that's the target. So moving LEFT first is okay. Alternatively, maybe I should go for (0,2) but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (7,0). Let's see. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. From (4,7), moving right 3 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 10. That's further. So not ideal. So (3,0) is better. So the plan is to move LEFT towards (3,0). But wait, another thought: if I move LEFT now, I can start heading towards (3,0), but maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left 4 times to (0,7), then down 5 times to (0,2). That's 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards (0,2) as well. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (0,2), they need to move left 9 times. So 9 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (9,6). So perhaps (0,2) is a safer target. But it's a longer path. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think about possible risks. If I go for (9,6), the enemy might reach it first, and then I would have wasted moves. If I go for (3,0), the enemy might not be going there, so I can get it. If I go for (0,2), same risk. So maybe (3,0) is the best option. Let's proceed with that. So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, the snake's body is empty, so there's no risk of running into itself. The only risks are walls, other snakes, or their own body. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and I'm moving to (3,7), which is safe. So moving LEFT is safe. So the direction is LEFT. But wait, let's check the board again. The board shows that at (3,0) there's an apple. So moving towards that. So yes, LEFT is the first step. Then down. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, another consideration: after moving LEFT, the next move would be DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? No, the apples are at (3,0), so only when I reach there. So the plan is to move LEFT. So the answer is LEFT. But wait, let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (3,7), then next move can be DOWN to (3,6), and so on. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (3,0) by moving left first, then down. This path avoids immediate competition and uses the shortest distance among available apples. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (9,4) with an empty body.\n\nHmm, I need to decide the next move. My goal is to get to an apple without colliding. Let's check the apples again. The closest ones are (3,0) which is directly below me. From (3,6), moving down each step would take me to (3,5), (3,4), etc., until I reach (3,0). That's 6 steps down. But there's also the apple at (0,2) which is to the left. But that's further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (7,0) is to the right and down, but that's even further. The apple at (9,6) is to the right, same y-coordinate as my current position. But Snake #1 is at (9,4), which is two steps below (9,6). If I go right towards (9,6), I might have to race Snake #1. Not sure if that's safe.\n\nWait, moving towards (3,0) seems safer. Let's check possible paths. From (3,6), possible moves are UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), or RIGHT to (4,6). If I go DOWN, I continue towards (3,0). That's the most direct path. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (9,4), so they're far away. The path down is clear. \n\nBut wait, what if there's a body part I can't see? The board state shows my snake's body as empty, so no issues there. The enemy's body is also empty. So moving down again should be safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (4,6) might get me closer to the apple at (7,0) or (9,6), but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,0) is the closest. Let's stick with the plan. \n\nSo next move should be DOWN again. That takes me to (3,5), one step closer to the apple. No immediate threats in that direction. The enemy is on the other side of the board. \n\nI need to make sure I don't hit any walls. Moving down from (3,6) to (3,5) is within the 0-9 range. All good. \n\nAnother consideration: if I keep moving down, I can reach (3,0) in 6 moves. But maybe there's another apple that's better. Let me check the distances again. \n\nManhattan distance to (3,0) is |3-3| + |6-0| = 6. To (0,2): |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 +4=7. To (7,0): 4 +6=10. To (9,6): 6 +0=6. So (9,6) is same distance as (3,0). But (9,6) is to the right. If I go right, I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves (6 steps right, same y). But Snake #1 is at (9,4). If they move up, they could reach (9,6) in 2 moves. So maybe they'll get there first. So (3,0) is safer because the enemy is far away. \n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. That's the safest path towards the closest apple without competition. \n\nI should also check if moving left or right would open up other paths. Moving left to (2,6) would take me towards (0,2), but that's a longer path. Moving right to (4,6) might lead towards (7,0) but again, longer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice here. No immediate threats, and the path is clear. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue descending towards the apple at (3,0) to secure it safely without competition from the distant enemy. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

From (3,5), moving down each step would take me closer. The distance is 5 steps (from y=5 to y=0). The enemy snake is at (9,5), which is on the right edge. They might be heading towards the apple at (9,6) which is one up from their position. So they might move UP next. \n\nMy options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- UP to (3,6): That's moving back where I came from. Not helpful unless there's an apple, but the closest apples are below. Also, moving up would take me away from (3,0).\n- DOWN to (3,4): Continues towards (3,0). Safe as long as the path is clear. No snakes or obstacles in that column.\n- LEFT to (2,5): Moves towards the apples at (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a longer path. Also, moving left might not be the most efficient.\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Moves towards the apples at (7,0) or (9,6). But (7,0) is further, and (9,6) is on the same row but far right. However, snake #1 is at (9,5), so if I go right, I might end up in a race for (9,6). But since snake #1 is at (9,5), they can reach (9,6) in one move (UP). So if I go right, I can't get there before them. So that's risky.\n\nThe safest path is still DOWN towards (3,0). The enemy is far away, and the path is clear. No bodies or obstacles. Moving down again would take me to (3,4), getting closer. \n\nI should also check if there's any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (9,5), which is not in my path. My own body is empty, so no self-collision. Walls aren't an issue since moving down from (3,5) to (3,4) is within the 0-9 range.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples that might be closer if I change direction? The apple at (0,2) is 3 units left and 3 units up from (3,5). Manhattan distance is 6. The apple at (3,0) is 5 units down. So (3,0) is closer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice.

The enemy snake #1 is at (9,5) with a body part at (9,5), so their body is [(9,5)] now. Wait, no\u2014the initial info said their body is [(9,5)] when they were at (9,6). Wait, the current positions:\n\nWait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3,4) with body at []\". So after moving DOWN, the head is at (3,4). The enemy snake #1 is at (9,6) with body at [(9,5)]? Wait, the initial problem statement says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n* Snake #1 is at position (9, 6) with body at [(9, 5)]\"\n\nBut in the board state, the 1 is at (9,6) in row 6 (y=6), and the T is at (9,5) in row 5. So snake #1's head is at (9,6), body at (9,5). So their next move could be to move in any direction, but their body is trailing behind.\n\nMy snake is at (3,4). The apple at (3,0) is directly below me. So moving down each step would take me closer. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (3,0). That's four moves away. But there's also an apple at (0,1) and (0,2) on the left edge. However, those are further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (5,6) is at x=5, y=6. From (3,4), that's two right and two up. But that's a bit of a detour. The apple at (7,0) is at x=7, y=0. From (3,4), moving right and down. But (3,0) is closer.\n\nSo the immediate goal is to reach (3,0). Let's check possible directions:\n\n- DOWN to (3,3): That's moving towards the apple. Safe? Let's check the board. The board state shows that at row 4 (y=4), column 3 is my snake's head. The next row down (y=3) is row 3, which according to the board is empty. The enemy snake is at (9,6), so they're far away. No immediate collision risk. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nOther directions:\n\n- UP to (3,5): That's moving back up. But there's no apple there, and it's away from the target. Not useful.\n\n- LEFT to (2,4): Moving left towards the left edge. The apples at (0,1) and (0,2) are there, but that's a longer path. Also, moving left might not be efficient. But checking if there's any obstacle. The board shows row 4 (y=4) as having my snake at (3,4), and the rest of the row is empty. So moving left to (2,4) is safe, but not optimal.\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4): Moving right towards the center. The apple at (5,6) is in that direction, but again, it's a detour. Also, moving right doesn't directly lead to any immediate apple. So not the best choice.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN towards (3,0). No obstacles in the path. The enemy snake is on the other side of the board, so no immediate threat. \n\nAnother consideration: Could there be a collision with the enemy snake's next move? Snake #1 is at (9,6) with body at (9,5). They might move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (8,6), that's away from me. If they move DOWN to (9,5), that's into their own body, which would kill them. So they probably won't do that. They might move UP to (9,7), but that's outside the board (since the board is 0-9). Wait, y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So (9,6) moving UP would be (9,7), which is valid. So they could move UP, but that's towards the apple at (9,6) which is already their position. Wait, the apples listed include (9,6)? Wait, the apples are at (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1), (5,6). Oh, (5,6) is an apple. So snake #1 is at (9,6), which is not an apple. The apple at (5,6) is at x=5, y=6. So snake #1 is at (9,6), which is not an apple. So they might move towards (5,6) or other apples. But they are far from me. So their movement is unlikely to affect me in the next few steps.\n\nTherefore, continuing DOWN is the safest and most efficient path to the nearest apple. No risks detected. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to efficiently collect it without encountering threats. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

Moving DOWN again would take me to (3,3), getting closer.\n\nWait, the board state shows the snake at (3,3) with body at []? Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem statement says: \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3, 3) with body at []\". Wait, that's conflicting with the previous move info. Wait, the user's last move information says that after moving DOWN, the snake is at (3,4). But in the current problem statement, the snake is now at (3,3). Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check again.\n\nThe current problem states:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3, 3) with body at []\"\n\nSo the head is at (3,3). The previous move was direction DOWN, which would have moved from (3,4) to (3,3). So the last move was DOWN, and now the head is at (3,3). The body is empty, so the snake is just the head. So the next move can be in any direction except UP (since that would reverse direction into itself, but since the body is empty, maybe it's allowed? Wait, no. Wait, the body is empty, so the snake is just a single segment. So moving UP from (3,3) to (3,4) is allowed because there's no body there. But in the previous move, the snake was at (3,4) and moved DOWN to (3,3). So the body would have been [(3,4)] if it had eaten an apple. But since the body is empty, that means the snake hasn't eaten any apples yet. So the snake is just the head moving around without any body segments.\n\nSo the current position is (3,3). The apples are at (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1), (5,6). The closest apple is (3,0), which is three steps down from (3,3). So moving DOWN each time would get me there. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (3,3) \u2192 DOWN to (3,2) \u2192 DOWN to (3,1) \u2192 DOWN to (3,0) to eat the apple. That's three moves. \n\nAre there any obstacles in the way? The board state shows that at row 3 (y=3), column 3 is the snake's head. The next positions down would be (3,2), (3,1), (3,0). Looking at the board:\n\nRow 2 (y=2) has an apple at (0,2), but that's on the left edge. Row 1 (y=1) has an apple at (0,1). Row 0 (y=0) has apples at (3,0) and (7,0). So moving down from (3,3) to (3,2) is safe. The board shows row 3 as having the snake at (3,3), and the rest of row 3 is empty. Then row 2 (y=2) is empty except for the apple at (0,2). So moving to (3,2) is safe. Then (3,1) is also empty. Then (3,0) is the apple. So no obstacles in the path.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (9,7) with body at [(9,6)]. They are on the top right corner. Their movement is unlikely to interfere with me since I'm on the left side. So no immediate threat from them.\n\nPossible directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP.\n\nDOWN: Towards the apple. Safe.\n\nLEFT: To (2,3). Not directly towards an apple, but maybe towards the apples at (0,1) or (0,2). But that's a longer path. Also, moving left would require going through (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), then down to (0,2) or (0,1). That's more steps. Not as efficient.\n\nRIGHT: To (4,3). Moving towards the center. The apple at (5,6) is in that direction but requires moving up and right. Not the closest.\n\nUP: To (3,4). That's moving back up. Since the body is empty, there's no risk of colliding with myself. But moving away from the closest apple. Not ideal.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. Continuing towards the apple at (3,0). No risks detected. Once I reach the apple, I'll grow by one segment. But since the body is empty now, after eating the apple, the body will be [(3,3)] (current head position becomes the first body segment). But that's for future moves. For now, just focus on getting to the apple safely.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other snakes or obstacles in the path? The board shows enemy snake #1 at (9,7) and their body at (9,6). They are far away. The other apples are not in my immediate path. So moving DOWN is safe.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to collect it efficiently. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples might be (0,2) and (0,1), but they're on the left side. From (4,7), moving left would take me towards x=0. But that's a bit far. Alternatively, (9,6) is on the top right. Hmm. Let's calculate distances.\n\nCurrent position is (4,7). To get to (9,6): the x distance is 5 (right), y distance is -1 (down). So total steps: 5 + 1 = 6. But moving right and down. But moving right would take me towards x=9. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, (0,2) is x=0, y=2. From (4,7), moving left 4 steps and down 5 steps. That's 9 steps. That's a lot. (0,1) is even lower in y. (3,0) is x=3, y=0. So from (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. That's 8 steps. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. So right 3, down 7. 10 steps. Hmm. So the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,6) with 6 steps. Then (0,2) is 4+5=9 steps. Wait, wait, Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So (9,6) is |4-9| + |7-6| = 5 +1=6. (0,2) is |4-0| + |7-2|=4+5=9. (3,0) is |4-3| + |7-0|=1+7=8. (7,0) is 3+7=10. (0,1) is 4+6=10. So (9,6) is the closest. So maybe I should go for that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (9,2). So if I go towards (9,6), I might be moving into the same area as the enemy. But since both snakes are just heads, maybe collision isn't an issue unless we move into each other. But right now, the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (9,6). So maybe that's safe.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (9,6). Let's see the path. From (4,7), to get to (9,6), I need to move right and down. But which direction first? Let's see possible moves. From (4,7), possible directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). So if I go RIGHT to (5,7), then next steps can continue right towards x=9, then down. Alternatively, go DOWN to (4,6), then right. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, then next move can be RIGHT again, and so on. But (9,6) is at y=6, so from (4,7), moving down would get me closer in y. Wait, (4,7) to (9,6): the x difference is 5, y difference is 1. So moving right 5 times and down once. But the order matters. Alternatively, moving down first to (4,6), then right 5 times. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving right first is better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The board shows that at (9,6) there's an apple. The enemy snake is at (9,2), which is in column 9, row 2. So moving to (9,6) is safe as long as the enemy isn't moving up. But since the enemy is at (9,2), their possible moves could be up, down, left, or right. But they might be going for apples as well. However, since they are at (9,2), the closest apple for them might be (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe they'll go for (9,6) as well. But that's a possibility. But since I'm starting at (4,7), I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves. The enemy is at (9,2), so to reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times, which would take 4 moves. So if I start moving towards (9,6) now, I can get there in 6 moves, while the enemy can get there in 4. So maybe they can reach it first. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe (9,6) is not the best target because the enemy can get there faster. So perhaps I should consider another apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,2) is at (0,2). From my position (4,7), moving left 4 and down 5. That's 9 steps. The enemy is at (9,2). To get to (0,2), they need to move left 9 steps (from x=9 to x=0), same y. So that's 9 steps. So if I go for (0,2), the enemy would take 9 steps, same as me. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, (0,1) is even lower. But that's 10 steps for me. (3,0) is 8 steps. (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is 8 steps. Let's see. (3,0) is at x=3, y=0. From (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 8. So that's the next closest. But moving down 7 steps would take me to the bottom of the board. Let's see the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down each step. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down first. But maybe there's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) but that's 9 steps. But perhaps the enemy is not going for that. Alternatively, maybe (3,0) is better. Let's see. If I go for (3,0), the path would be left once, then down 7 times. But moving down 7 steps from (3,7) to (3,0). But that's a straight line. But during that path, are there any apples? The apples at (3,0) is the target, and (7,0) is another. So maybe that's a possible path. But moving down so much might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area. But the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (3,0). So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (0,1) or (0,2), but those are on the left edge. Let's check the board again. The board shows that at (0,2) and (0,1) there are apples. So if I can reach those, but the path is long. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for (9,6), which is closer to them. So perhaps I can go for (3,0) or (7,0). Let's compare (3,0) and (7,0). (3,0) is 8 steps, (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is better. So maybe I should head towards (3,0). Let's plan the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down to (3,6), (3,5), etc., until (3,0). That's 7 steps down. But that's a straight line. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and their body is empty, they can't block me. So the path is clear. So moving left first to (3,7), then down. But wait, the first move is from (4,7). So possible directions: LEFT to (3,7), DOWN to (4,6), RIGHT to (5,7), or UP to (4,8). But UP would take me to (4,8), which is within the board. But why go up? Maybe not necessary. So if I want to go to (3,0), the first move should be LEFT. Then proceed down. But let's check if moving left is safe. The current position is (4,7). Moving left to (3,7). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (9,2), so (3,7) is safe. So moving left is okay. Then next move down to (3,6), and so on. So the first move would be LEFT. But wait, the apple at (3,0) is in column 3, row 0. So that's a long way down. But maybe that's a safer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then left again to (2,7), etc. But that's a lot of left moves. Then down. But that's 4 lefts and 5 downs. So 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards other apples. But perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to go for the closest apple, which is (9,6), even though the enemy might reach it first. But if I can get there before them, or if they are not going for it, then it's worth it. Let's calculate again. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times. So 4 moves. I'm at (4,7). To reach (9,6), I need to move right 5 times and down once. So 6 moves. So the enemy can get there in 4 moves, which is faster. So if they are going for that apple, they will get it first. So maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. So (3,0) is 8 moves. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (3,0), they need to move left 6 and down 2. So 8 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (0,2) or (0,1). So perhaps (3,0) is a better target. Let's proceed towards (3,0). So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. But wait, after moving left, the next move would be DOWN. So the first move is LEFT. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see. If I move DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6), then I can start moving left. But that would take me closer to (3,0) in a different way. Let's compare the paths. If I go LEFT first, then down, the path is (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). If I go DOWN first, then left, the path is (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). Either way, same number of steps. But moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first could be better if there's a reason. But I don't see any obstacles. So maybe LEFT is better. So first move LEFT. Then down. But wait, after moving LEFT to (3,7), the next move can be DOWN to (3,6), then continue down. So that's the path. So the first move is LEFT. But let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,7). Then next move DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). So along the path to (3,0), there are no other apples. So the only apple is at (3,0). So that's the target. So moving LEFT first is okay. Alternatively, maybe I should go for (0,2) but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (7,0). Let's see. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. From (4,7), moving right 3 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 10. That's further. So not ideal. So (3,0) is better. So the plan is to move LEFT towards (3,0). But wait, another thought: if I move LEFT now, I can start heading towards (3,0), but maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left 4 times to (0,7), then down 5 times to (0,2). That's 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards (0,2) as well. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (0,2), they need to move left 9 times. So 9 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (9,6). So perhaps (0,2) is a safer target. But it's a longer path. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think about possible risks. If I go for (9,6), the enemy might reach it first, and then I would have wasted moves. If I go for (3,0), the enemy might not be going there, so I can get it. If I go for (0,2), same risk. So maybe (3,0) is the best option. Let's proceed with that. So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, the snake's body is empty, so there's no risk of running into itself. The only risks are walls, other snakes, or their own body. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and I'm moving to (3,7), which is safe. So moving LEFT is safe. So the direction is LEFT. But wait, let's check the board again. The board shows that at (3,0) there's an apple. So moving towards that. So yes, LEFT is the first step. Then down. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, another consideration: after moving LEFT, the next move would be DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? No, the apples are at (3,0), so only when I reach there. So the plan is to move LEFT. So the answer is LEFT. But wait, let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (3,7), then next move can be DOWN to (3,6), and so on. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (3,0) by moving left first, then down. This path avoids immediate competition and uses the shortest distance among available apples. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (9,4) with an empty body.\n\nHmm, I need to decide the next move. My goal is to get to an apple without colliding. Let's check the apples again. The closest ones are (3,0) which is directly below me. From (3,6), moving down each step would take me to (3,5), (3,4), etc., until I reach (3,0). That's 6 steps down. But there's also the apple at (0,2) which is to the left. But that's further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (7,0) is to the right and down, but that's even further. The apple at (9,6) is to the right, same y-coordinate as my current position. But Snake #1 is at (9,4), which is two steps below (9,6). If I go right towards (9,6), I might have to race Snake #1. Not sure if that's safe.\n\nWait, moving towards (3,0) seems safer. Let's check possible paths. From (3,6), possible moves are UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), or RIGHT to (4,6). If I go DOWN, I continue towards (3,0). That's the most direct path. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (9,4), so they're far away. The path down is clear. \n\nBut wait, what if there's a body part I can't see? The board state shows my snake's body as empty, so no issues there. The enemy's body is also empty. So moving down again should be safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (4,6) might get me closer to the apple at (7,0) or (9,6), but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,0) is the closest. Let's stick with the plan. \n\nSo next move should be DOWN again. That takes me to (3,5), one step closer to the apple. No immediate threats in that direction. The enemy is on the other side of the board. \n\nI need to make sure I don't hit any walls. Moving down from (3,6) to (3,5) is within the 0-9 range. All good. \n\nAnother consideration: if I keep moving down, I can reach (3,0) in 6 moves. But maybe there's another apple that's better. Let me check the distances again. \n\nManhattan distance to (3,0) is |3-3| + |6-0| = 6. To (0,2): |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 +4=7. To (7,0): 4 +6=10. To (9,6): 6 +0=6. So (9,6) is same distance as (3,0). But (9,6) is to the right. If I go right, I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves (6 steps right, same y). But Snake #1 is at (9,4). If they move up, they could reach (9,6) in 2 moves. So maybe they'll get there first. So (3,0) is safer because the enemy is far away. \n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. That's the safest path towards the closest apple without competition. \n\nI should also check if moving left or right would open up other paths. Moving left to (2,6) would take me towards (0,2), but that's a longer path. Moving right to (4,6) might lead towards (7,0) but again, longer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice here.

The enemy snake #1 is at (9,5) with a body part at (9,5), so their body is [(9,5)] now. Wait, no\u2014the initial info said their body is [(9,5)] when they were at (9,6). Wait, the current positions:\n\nWait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3,4) with body at []\". So after moving DOWN, the head is at (3,4). The enemy snake #1 is at (9,6) with body at [(9,5)]? Wait, the initial problem statement says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n* Snake #1 is at position (9, 6) with body at [(9, 5)]\"\n\nBut in the board state, the 1 is at (9,6) in row 6 (y=6), and the T is at (9,5) in row 5. So snake #1's head is at (9,6), body at (9,5). So their next move could be to move in any direction, but their body is trailing behind.\n\nMy snake is at (3,4). The apple at (3,0) is directly below me. So moving down each step would take me closer. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (3,0). That's four moves away.

From (3,4), that's two right and two up. But that's a bit of a detour. The apple at (7,0) is at x=7, y=0. From (3,4), moving right and down. But (3,0) is closer.\n\nSo the immediate goal is to reach (3,0). Let's check possible directions:\n\n- DOWN to (3,3): That's moving towards the apple. Safe? Let's check the board. The board state shows that at row 4 (y=4), column 3 is my snake's head. The next row down (y=3) is row 3, which according to the board is empty. The enemy snake is at (9,6), so they're far away. No immediate collision risk. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nOther directions:\n\n- UP to (3,5): That's moving back up. But there's no apple there, and it's away from the target. Not useful.\n\n- LEFT to (2,4): Moving left towards the left edge. The apples at (0,1) and (0,2) are there, but that's a longer path. Also, moving left might not be efficient. But checking if there's any obstacle. The board shows row 4 (y=4) as having my snake at (3,4), and the rest of the row is empty. So moving left to (2,4) is safe, but not optimal.\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4): Moving right towards the center. The apple at (5,6) is in that direction, but again, it's a detour. Also, moving right doesn't directly lead to any immediate apple. So not the best choice.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN towards (3,0). No obstacles in the path. The enemy snake is on the other side of the board, so no immediate threat. \n\nAnother consideration: Could there be a collision with the enemy snake's next move? Snake #1 is at (9,6) with body at (9,5). They might move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (8,6), that's away from me. If they move DOWN to (9,5), that's into their own body, which would kill them. So they probably won't do that. They might move UP to (9,7), but that's outside the board (since the board is 0-9). Wait, y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So (9,6) moving UP would be (9,7), which is valid. So they could move UP, but that's towards the apple at (9,6) which is already their position. Wait, the apples listed include (9,6)? Wait, the apples are at (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1), (5,6). Oh, (5,6) is an apple. So snake #1 is at (9,6), which is not an apple. The apple at (5,6) is at x=5, y=6. So snake #1 is at (9,6), which is not an apple. So they might move towards (5,6) or other apples. But they are far from me. So their movement is unlikely to affect me in the next few steps.\n\nTherefore, continuing DOWN is the safest and most efficient path to the nearest apple. No risks detected. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to efficiently collect it without encountering threats. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

But since the body is empty, that means the snake hasn't eaten any apples yet. So the snake is just the head moving around without any body segments.\n\nSo the current position is (3,3). The apples are at (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1), (5,6). The closest apple is (3,0), which is three steps down from (3,3). So moving DOWN each time would get me there. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (3,3) \u2192 DOWN to (3,2) \u2192 DOWN to (3,1) \u2192 DOWN to (3,0) to eat the apple. That's three moves. \n\nAre there any obstacles in the way? The board state shows that at row 3 (y=3), column 3 is the snake's head. The next positions down would be (3,2), (3,1), (3,0). Looking at the board:\n\nRow 2 (y=2) has an apple at (0,2), but that's on the left edge. Row 1 (y=1) has an apple at (0,1). Row 0 (y=0) has apples at (3,0) and (7,0). So moving down from (3,3) to (3,2) is safe. The board shows row 3 as having the snake at (3,3), and the rest of row 3 is empty. Then row 2 (y=2) is empty except for the apple at (0,2). So moving to (3,2) is safe. Then (3,1) is also empty. Then (3,0) is the apple. So no obstacles in the path.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (9,7) with body at [(9,6)]. They are on the top right corner. Their movement is unlikely to interfere with me since I'm on the left side. So no immediate threat from them.\n\nPossible directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP.\n\nDOWN: Towards the apple. Safe.\n\nLEFT: To (2,3). Not directly towards an apple, but maybe towards the apples at (0,1) or (0,2). But that's a longer path. Also, moving left would require going through (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), then down to (0,2) or (0,1). That's more steps. Not as efficient.\n\nRIGHT: To (4,3). Moving towards the center. The apple at (5,6) is in that direction but requires moving up and right. Not the closest.\n\nUP: To (3,4). That's moving back up. Since the body is empty, there's no risk of colliding with myself. But moving away from the closest apple. Not ideal.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. Continuing towards the apple at (3,0). No risks detected. Once I reach the apple, I'll grow by one segment. But since the body is empty now, after eating the apple, the body will be [(3,3)] (current head position becomes the first body segment). But that's for future moves. For now, just focus on getting to the apple safely.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other snakes or obstacles in the path? The board shows enemy snake #1 at (9,7) and their body at (9,6). They are far away. The other apples are not in my immediate path. So moving DOWN is safe.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to collect it efficiently. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

          "2": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2 at (4,7). The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). The board is 10x10. My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's look at the positions. The closest apples might be (0,2) and (0,1), but they're on the left side. From (4,7), moving left would take me towards x=0. But that's a bit far. Alternatively, (9,6) is on the top right. Hmm. Let's calculate distances.\n\nCurrent position is (4,7). To get to (9,6): the x distance is 5 (right), y distance is -1 (down). So total steps: 5 + 1 = 6. But moving right and down. But moving right would take me towards x=9. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, (0,2) is x=0, y=2. From (4,7), moving left 4 steps and down 5 steps. That's 9 steps. That's a lot. (0,1) is even lower in y. (3,0) is x=3, y=0. So from (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. That's 8 steps. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. So right 3, down 7. 10 steps. Hmm. So the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,6) with 6 steps. Then (0,2) is 4+5=9 steps. Wait, wait, Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. So (9,6) is |4-9| + |7-6| = 5 +1=6. (0,2) is |4-0| + |7-2|=4+5=9. (3,0) is |4-3| + |7-0|=1+7=8. (7,0) is 3+7=10. (0,1) is 4+6=10. So (9,6) is the closest. So maybe I should go for that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (9,2). So if I go towards (9,6), I might be moving into the same area as the enemy. But since both snakes are just heads, maybe collision isn't an issue unless we move into each other. But right now, the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (9,6). So maybe that's safe.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (9,6). Let's see the path. From (4,7), to get to (9,6), I need to move right and down. But which direction first? Let's see possible moves. From (4,7), possible directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). So if I go RIGHT to (5,7), then next steps can continue right towards x=9, then down. Alternatively, go DOWN to (4,6), then right. Let's see which path is better.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, then next move can be RIGHT again, and so on. But (9,6) is at y=6, so from (4,7), moving down would get me closer in y. Wait, (4,7) to (9,6): the x difference is 5, y difference is 1. So moving right 5 times and down once. But the order matters. Alternatively, moving down first to (4,6), then right 5 times. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving right first is better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The board shows that at (9,6) there's an apple. The enemy snake is at (9,2), which is in column 9, row 2. So moving to (9,6) is safe as long as the enemy isn't moving up. But since the enemy is at (9,2), their possible moves could be up, down, left, or right. But they might be going for apples as well. However, since they are at (9,2), the closest apple for them might be (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe they'll go for (9,6) as well. But that's a possibility. But since I'm starting at (4,7), I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves. The enemy is at (9,2), so to reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times, which would take 4 moves. So if I start moving towards (9,6) now, I can get there in 6 moves, while the enemy can get there in 4. So maybe they can reach it first. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe (9,6) is not the best target because the enemy can get there faster. So perhaps I should consider another apple.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (0,2) is at (0,2). From my position (4,7), moving left 4 and down 5. That's 9 steps. The enemy is at (9,2). To get to (0,2), they need to move left 9 steps (from x=9 to x=0), same y. So that's 9 steps. So if I go for (0,2), the enemy would take 9 steps, same as me. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, (0,1) is even lower. But that's 10 steps for me. (3,0) is 8 steps. (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is 8 steps. Let's see. (3,0) is at x=3, y=0. From (4,7), moving left 1 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 8. So that's the next closest. But moving down 7 steps would take me to the bottom of the board. Let's see the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down each step. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down first. But maybe there's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) but that's 9 steps. But perhaps the enemy is not going for that. Alternatively, maybe (3,0) is better. Let's see. If I go for (3,0), the path would be left once, then down 7 times. But moving down 7 steps from (3,7) to (3,0). But that's a straight line. But during that path, are there any apples? The apples at (3,0) is the target, and (7,0) is another. So maybe that's a possible path. But moving down so much might be risky if the enemy is moving towards that area. But the enemy is at (9,2), which is far from (3,0). So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (0,1) or (0,2), but those are on the left edge. Let's check the board again. The board shows that at (0,2) and (0,1) there are apples. So if I can reach those, but the path is long. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for (9,6), which is closer to them. So perhaps I can go for (3,0) or (7,0). Let's compare (3,0) and (7,0). (3,0) is 8 steps, (7,0) is 10 steps. So (3,0) is better. So maybe I should head towards (3,0). Let's plan the path. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then down to (3,6), (3,5), etc., until (3,0). That's 7 steps down. But that's a straight line. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and their body is empty, they can't block me. So the path is clear. So moving left first to (3,7), then down. But wait, the first move is from (4,7). So possible directions: LEFT to (3,7), DOWN to (4,6), RIGHT to (5,7), or UP to (4,8). But UP would take me to (4,8), which is within the board. But why go up? Maybe not necessary. So if I want to go to (3,0), the first move should be LEFT. Then proceed down. But let's check if moving left is safe. The current position is (4,7). Moving left to (3,7). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (9,2), so (3,7) is safe. So moving left is okay. Then next move down to (3,6), and so on. So the first move would be LEFT. But wait, the apple at (3,0) is in column 3, row 0. So that's a long way down. But maybe that's a safer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left to (3,7), then left again to (2,7), etc. But that's a lot of left moves. Then down. But that's 4 lefts and 5 downs. So 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards other apples. But perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. Alternatively, maybe the best option is to go for the closest apple, which is (9,6), even though the enemy might reach it first. But if I can get there before them, or if they are not going for it, then it's worth it. Let's calculate again. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (9,6), they need to move up 4 times. So 4 moves. I'm at (4,7). To reach (9,6), I need to move right 5 times and down once. So 6 moves. So the enemy can get there in 4 moves, which is faster. So if they are going for that apple, they will get it first. So maybe I should avoid that and go for another apple. So (3,0) is 8 moves. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (3,0), they need to move left 6 and down 2. So 8 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (0,2) or (0,1). So perhaps (3,0) is a better target. Let's proceed towards (3,0). So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. But wait, after moving left, the next move would be DOWN. So the first move is LEFT. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see. If I move DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6), then I can start moving left. But that would take me closer to (3,0) in a different way. Let's compare the paths. If I go LEFT first, then down, the path is (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). If I go DOWN first, then left, the path is (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (3,0). Either way, same number of steps. But moving LEFT first might be better because it gets me closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first could be better if there's a reason. But I don't see any obstacles. So maybe LEFT is better. So first move LEFT. Then down. But wait, after moving LEFT to (3,7), the next move can be DOWN to (3,6), then continue down. So that's the path. So the first move is LEFT. But let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,7). Then next move DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? The apples are at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1). So along the path to (3,0), there are no other apples. So the only apple is at (3,0). So that's the target. So moving LEFT first is okay. Alternatively, maybe I should go for (0,2) but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (7,0). Let's see. (7,0) is x=7, y=0. From (4,7), moving right 3 and down 7. So Manhattan distance is 10. That's further. So not ideal. So (3,0) is better. So the plan is to move LEFT towards (3,0). But wait, another thought: if I move LEFT now, I can start heading towards (3,0), but maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, maybe I can go for (0,2) by moving left and down. Let's see. From (4,7), moving left 4 times to (0,7), then down 5 times to (0,2). That's 9 moves. But during that time, the enemy might be moving towards (0,2) as well. The enemy is at (9,2). To reach (0,2), they need to move left 9 times. So 9 moves. So same as me. So it's a race. But maybe they are not going for that. Alternatively, maybe they are going for (9,6). So perhaps (0,2) is a safer target. But it's a longer path. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think about possible risks. If I go for (9,6), the enemy might reach it first, and then I would have wasted moves. If I go for (3,0), the enemy might not be going there, so I can get it. If I go for (0,2), same risk. So maybe (3,0) is the best option. Let's proceed with that. So first move LEFT to (3,7). Then down each step. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, the snake's body is empty, so there's no risk of running into itself. The only risks are walls, other snakes, or their own body. Since the enemy is at (9,2), and I'm moving to (3,7), which is safe. So moving LEFT is safe. So the direction is LEFT. But wait, let's check the board again. The board shows that at (3,0) there's an apple. So moving towards that. So yes, LEFT is the first step. Then down. So the first move is LEFT. But wait, another consideration: after moving LEFT, the next move would be DOWN. But what if there's an apple along the way? No, the apples are at (3,0), so only when I reach there. So the plan is to move LEFT. So the answer is LEFT. But wait, let me double-check. If I move LEFT to (3,7), then next move can be DOWN to (3,6), and so on. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. So the direction is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (3,0) by moving left first, then down. This path avoids immediate competition and uses the shortest distance among available apples. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (9,4) with an empty body.\n\nHmm, I need to decide the next move. My goal is to get to an apple without colliding. Let's check the apples again. The closest ones are (3,0) which is directly below me. From (3,6), moving down each step would take me to (3,5), (3,4), etc., until I reach (3,0). That's 6 steps down. But there's also the apple at (0,2) which is to the left. But that's further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (7,0) is to the right and down, but that's even further. The apple at (9,6) is to the right, same y-coordinate as my current position. But Snake #1 is at (9,4), which is two steps below (9,6). If I go right towards (9,6), I might have to race Snake #1. Not sure if that's safe.\n\nWait, moving towards (3,0) seems safer. Let's check possible paths. From (3,6), possible moves are UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), or RIGHT to (4,6). If I go DOWN, I continue towards (3,0). That's the most direct path. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (9,4), so they're far away. The path down is clear. \n\nBut wait, what if there's a body part I can't see? The board state shows my snake's body as empty, so no issues there. The enemy's body is also empty. So moving down again should be safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (4,6) might get me closer to the apple at (7,0) or (9,6), but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,0) is the closest. Let's stick with the plan. \n\nSo next move should be DOWN again. That takes me to (3,5), one step closer to the apple. No immediate threats in that direction. The enemy is on the other side of the board. \n\nI need to make sure I don't hit any walls. Moving down from (3,6) to (3,5) is within the 0-9 range. All good. \n\nAnother consideration: if I keep moving down, I can reach (3,0) in 6 moves. But maybe there's another apple that's better. Let me check the distances again. \n\nManhattan distance to (3,0) is |3-3| + |6-0| = 6. To (0,2): |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 +4=7. To (7,0): 4 +6=10. To (9,6): 6 +0=6. So (9,6) is same distance as (3,0). But (9,6) is to the right. If I go right, I can reach (9,6) in 6 moves (6 steps right, same y). But Snake #1 is at (9,4). If they move up, they could reach (9,6) in 2 moves. So maybe they'll get there first. So (3,0) is safer because the enemy is far away. \n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. That's the safest path towards the closest apple without competition. \n\nI should also check if moving left or right would open up other paths. Moving left to (2,6) would take me towards (0,2), but that's a longer path. Moving right to (4,6) might lead towards (7,0) but again, longer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice here. No immediate threats, and the path is clear. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue descending towards the apple at (3,0) to secure it safely without competition from the distant enemy. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

The apples are still at (9,6), (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), and (0,1). The enemy snake #1 is at (9,5) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apple at (3,0) is directly below me. From (3,5), moving down each step would take me closer. The distance is 5 steps (from y=5 to y=0). The enemy snake is at (9,5), which is on the right edge. They might be heading towards the apple at (9,6) which is one up from their position. So they might move UP next. \n\nMy options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- UP to (3,6): That's moving back where I came from. Not helpful unless there's an apple, but the closest apples are below. Also, moving up would take me away from (3,0).\n- DOWN to (3,4): Continues towards (3,0). Safe as long as the path is clear. No snakes or obstacles in that column.\n- LEFT to (2,5): Moves towards the apples at (0,2) or (0,1), but that's a longer path. Also, moving left might not be the most efficient.\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Moves towards the apples at (7,0) or (9,6). But (7,0) is further, and (9,6) is on the same row but far right. However, snake #1 is at (9,5), so if I go right, I might end up in a race for (9,6). But since snake #1 is at (9,5), they can reach (9,6) in one move (UP). So if I go right, I can't get there before them. So that's risky.\n\nThe safest path is still DOWN towards (3,0). The enemy is far away, and the path is clear. No bodies or obstacles. Moving down again would take me to (3,4), getting closer. \n\nI should also check if there's any immediate collision. The enemy snake is at (9,5), which is not in my path. My own body is empty, so no self-collision. Walls aren't an issue since moving down from (3,5) to (3,4) is within the 0-9 range.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples that might be closer if I change direction? The apple at (0,2) is 3 units left and 3 units up from (3,5). Manhattan distance is 6. The apple at (3,0) is 5 units down. So (3,0) is closer. \n\nSticking with DOWN is the best choice.

The enemy snake #1 is at (9,5) with a body part at (9,5), so their body is [(9,5)] now. Wait, no\u2014the initial info said their body is [(9,5)] when they were at (9,6). Wait, the current positions:\n\nWait, the user's last move info says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3,4) with body at []\". So after moving DOWN, the head is at (3,4). The enemy snake #1 is at (9,6) with body at [(9,5)]? Wait, the initial problem statement says:\n\n\"Enemy snakes positions:\n* Snake #1 is at position (9, 6) with body at [(9, 5)]\"\n\nBut in the board state, the 1 is at (9,6) in row 6 (y=6), and the T is at (9,5) in row 5. So snake #1's head is at (9,6), body at (9,5). So their next move could be to move in any direction, but their body is trailing behind.\n\nMy snake is at (3,4). The apple at (3,0) is directly below me. So moving down each step would take me closer. From (3,4), moving down to (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (3,0). That's four moves away. But there's also an apple at (0,1) and (0,2) on the left edge. However, those are further away in terms of Manhattan distance. The apple at (5,6) is at x=5, y=6. From (3,4), that's two right and two up. But that's a bit of a detour. The apple at (7,0) is at x=7, y=0. From (3,4), moving right and down. But (3,0) is closer.\n\nSo the immediate goal is to reach (3,0). Let's check possible directions:\n\n- DOWN to (3,3): That's moving towards the apple. Safe? Let's check the board. The board state shows that at row 4 (y=4), column 3 is my snake's head. The next row down (y=3) is row 3, which according to the board is empty. The enemy snake is at (9,6), so they're far away. No immediate collision risk. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nOther directions:\n\n- UP to (3,5): That's moving back up. But there's no apple there, and it's away from the target. Not useful.\n\n- LEFT to (2,4): Moving left towards the left edge. The apples at (0,1) and (0,2) are there, but that's a longer path. Also, moving left might not be efficient. But checking if there's any obstacle. The board shows row 4 (y=4) as having my snake at (3,4), and the rest of the row is empty. So moving left to (2,4) is safe, but not optimal.\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4): Moving right towards the center. The apple at (5,6) is in that direction, but again, it's a detour. Also, moving right doesn't directly lead to any immediate apple. So not the best choice.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN towards (3,0). No obstacles in the path. The enemy snake is on the other side of the board, so no immediate threat. \n\nAnother consideration: Could there be a collision with the enemy snake's next move? Snake #1 is at (9,6) with body at (9,5). They might move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (8,6), that's away from me. If they move DOWN to (9,5), that's into their own body, which would kill them. So they probably won't do that. They might move UP to (9,7), but that's outside the board (since the board is 0-9). Wait, y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So (9,6) moving UP would be (9,7), which is valid. So they could move UP, but that's towards the apple at (9,6) which is already their position. Wait, the apples listed include (9,6)? Wait, the apples are at (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1), (5,6). Oh, (5,6) is an apple. So snake #1 is at (9,6), which is not an apple. The apple at (5,6) is at x=5, y=6. So snake #1 is at (9,6), which is not an apple. So they might move towards (5,6) or other apples. But they are far from me. So their movement is unlikely to affect me in the next few steps.\n\nTherefore, continuing DOWN is the safest and most efficient path to the nearest apple. No risks detected. \n\nNext move: DOWN\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to efficiently collect it without encountering threats. \n\nNext move: DOWN"

Moving up is fine, but getting to that apple (0,1) seems more logical for closer distance, and I'm not in danger.\n\nNext move strategy for next turn:  Prioritize apples. If multiple apples are close, go for the one that is closest and in an advantageous position that is less dangerous. If an enemy snake is in the path, prioritize avoiding the enemy.

Moving DOWN again would take me to (3,3), getting closer.\n\nWait, the board state shows the snake at (3,3) with body at []? Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem statement says: \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3, 3) with body at []\". Wait, that's conflicting with the previous move info. Wait, the user's last move information says that after moving DOWN, the snake is at (3,4). But in the current problem statement, the snake is now at (3,3). Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check again.\n\nThe current problem states:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3, 3) with body at []\"\n\nSo the head is at (3,3). The previous move was direction DOWN, which would have moved from (3,4) to (3,3). So the last move was DOWN, and now the head is at (3,3). The body is empty, so the snake is just the head. So the next move can be in any direction except UP (since that would reverse direction into itself, but since the body is empty, maybe it's allowed? Wait, no. Wait, the body is empty, so the snake is just a single segment. So moving UP from (3,3) to (3,4) is allowed because there's no body there. But in the previous move, the snake was at (3,4) and moved DOWN to (3,3). So the body would have been [(3,4)] if it had eaten an apple. But since the body is empty, that means the snake hasn't eaten any apples yet. So the snake is just the head moving around without any body segments.\n\nSo the current position is (3,3). The apples are at (0,2), (7,0), (3,0), (0,1), (5,6). The closest apple is (3,0), which is three steps down from (3,3). So moving DOWN each time would get me there. Let's check the path:\n\nFrom (3,3) \u2192 DOWN to (3,2) \u2192 DOWN to (3,1) \u2192 DOWN to (3,0) to eat the apple. That's three moves. \n\nAre there any obstacles in the way? The board state shows that at row 3 (y=3), column 3 is the snake's head. The next positions down would be (3,2), (3,1), (3,0). Looking at the board:\n\nRow 2 (y=2) has an apple at (0,2), but that's on the left edge. Row 1 (y=1) has an apple at (0,1). Row 0 (y=0) has apples at (3,0) and (7,0). So moving down from (3,3) to (3,2) is safe. The board shows row 3 as having the snake at (3,3), and the rest of row 3 is empty. Then row 2 (y=2) is empty except for the apple at (0,2). So moving to (3,2) is safe. Then (3,1) is also empty. Then (3,0) is the apple. So no obstacles in the path.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (9,7) with body at [(9,6)]. They are on the top right corner. Their movement is unlikely to interfere with me since I'm on the left side. So no immediate threat from them.\n\nPossible directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP.\n\nDOWN: Towards the apple. Safe.\n\nLEFT: To (2,3). Not directly towards an apple, but maybe towards the apples at (0,1) or (0,2). But that's a longer path. Also, moving left would require going through (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), then down to (0,2) or (0,1). That's more steps. Not as efficient.\n\nRIGHT: To (4,3). Moving towards the center. The apple at (5,6) is in that direction but requires moving up and right. Not the closest.\n\nUP: To (3,4). That's moving back up. Since the body is empty, there's no risk of colliding with myself. But moving away from the closest apple. Not ideal.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN again. Continuing towards the apple at (3,0). No risks detected. Once I reach the apple, I'll grow by one segment. But since the body is empty now, after eating the apple, the body will be [(3,3)] (current head position becomes the first body segment). But that's for future moves. For now, just focus on getting to the apple safely.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other snakes or obstacles in the path? The board shows enemy snake #1 at (9,7) and their body at (9,6). They are far away. The other apples are not in my immediate path. So moving DOWN is safe.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,0) to collect it efficiently. \n\nNext move: DOWN"
