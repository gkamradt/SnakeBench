From here, we cannot go left (that would be off the board) or right (since (1,3) is occupied by our own body segment, marked \u201cT\u201d). So our only safe moves are UP and DOWN.\n\nLooking at the apple positions\u2014\n\u2003\u2022 (4, 2)\n\u2003\u2022 (6, 1)\n\u2003\u2022 (3, 1)\n\u2003\u2022 (9, 2)\n\u2003\u2022 (4, 9)\u2014\nI see that the apple at (3,1) or the one at (4,2) is relatively nearby by Manhattan distance. From (0,3) our best approach to start heading toward these apples is to work our way down, because moving down from (0,3) to (0,2) is safe and positions us a step closer (vertically) to the lower-valued apple rows.\n\nAlso, moving UP would take us farther from these desirable targets and would edge us toward the top apple at (4,9), but that\u2019s further away overall. Meanwhile, enemy snake #1 is in the lower left (head (0,0) and body across (1,0)\u2013(3,0)), so we need to be cautious: by moving down, we stay clear of our own body and avoid immediate conflicts while beginning a path toward one of the apples.\n\nThus, my strategy is:\n\u20031. Move DOWN to (0,2) to safely proceed.\n\u20032. Then later, maneuver right and down toward the apple around (3,1) or (4,2) while watching the enemy snake\u2019s position.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
