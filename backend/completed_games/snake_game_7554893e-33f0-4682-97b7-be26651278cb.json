Also, moving left into (5,4) is immediately safe because that cell is unoccupied. \n\nThe other options from (6,4):\n\u2022 UP to (6,5) is safe, but it doesn't position us as directly toward an apple as moving left does.\n\u2022 DOWN (to (6,3)) is safe too, but would take us farther away from our preferred upward apple and closer to the enemy\u2019s general area.\n\u2022 RIGHT is not viable because (7,4) is part of our own snake\u2019s body.\n\nMy plan is to move LEFT now to approach the apple at (5,9) in a more direct fashion in the coming moves.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
