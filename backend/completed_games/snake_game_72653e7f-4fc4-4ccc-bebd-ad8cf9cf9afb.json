However, it keeps options open for future movements and avoids immediate confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell is empty and seems safe.\n   - **Strategic Value:** Moving down brings the snake closer to the apple at (2, 0). This could be advantageous for collecting points in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 5):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell is empty and seems safe.\n   - **Strategic Value:** Moving left positions the snake closer to the apple at (1, 2). This can be a strategic move to secure a nearby apple while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell is empty and seems safe.\n   - **Strategic Value:** Moving right increases the distance from the enemy snake at (8, 5), but it doesn't lead directly to any apples. This move might be less advantageous compared to others.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Proximity to Apples:** Approaching apples to maximize points is crucial. Moving left towards (1, 5) sets up the snake to access the nearby apple at (1, 2) in the following moves.\n- **Enemy Avoidance:** Maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake is essential to avoid potential collisions. All possible moves are currently safe, but positioning towards the left minimizes future risks.\n- **Future Planning:** Prioritizing paths that offer multiple movement options in subsequent turns ensures flexibility and safety.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **LEFT** to position (1, 5) to position the snake closer to the apple at (1, 2), maximizing the potential for immediate and future gains while maintaining safety.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

Moving here would result in a collision, leading to death.\n   - **Conclusion:** **Unsafe** \u2013 should avoid moving UP.\n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 0):**  \n   - **Safety:** The position (1, 0) is empty (`.`) and within the board boundaries.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving downward positions my snake closer to the apple at **(2, 0)**. This apple is adjacent and can be collected in the next move, providing an immediate point gain and potentially extending my snake's length. Additionally, this move maintains open pathways for future navigation without immediate threats from enemy snakes.\n   - **Strategic Advantage:** Facilitates quick apple collection and maintains flexibility for subsequent moves.\n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 1):**  \n   - **Safety:** The position (0, 1) is empty (`.`) and safe to move into.\n   - **Benefit:** While moving left brings me closer to the apple at **(0, 7)**, this apple is farther away, requiring multiple moves to reach. This increases exposure to potential threats from enemy snakes and restricts immediate growth opportunities.\n   - **Strategic Consideration:** Less advantageous compared to moving DOWN due to the distance to the nearest apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 1):**  \n   - **Safety:** The position (2, 1) is empty (`.`) and safe to move into.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving right places me in proximity to the apple at **(2, 0)**. However, to collect it, an additional move downward would be required, similar to moving directly DOWN. This option offers similar benefits but adds an extra step to reach the apple.\n   - **Strategic Consideration:** Slightly less efficient than moving DOWN directly towards (1, 0).\n\n**Strategy for the Next Turn:**\n\nPrioritize collecting the nearest apple at **(2, 0)** by moving downward to **(1, 0)**. This move offers an immediate point gain with minimal risk and positions my snake advantageously for future maneuvers. After collecting the apple, I can continue to navigate towards other apples while maintaining awareness of enemy snake movements.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"

After getting the apple at (9, 0), I should also consider going for other apples that are far away from the enemy snake #2.\n\nSince I'm already at (9, 1) and the apple is at (9, 0), I can get the apple by moving down one more time.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

This apple is adjacent and can be collected in the next move, providing an immediate point gain and potentially extending my snake's length. Additionally, this move maintains open pathways for future navigation without immediate threats from enemy snakes.\n   - **Strategic Advantage:** Facilitates quick apple collection and maintains flexibility for subsequent moves.\n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 1):**  \n   - **Safety:** The position (0, 1) is empty (`.`) and safe to move into.\n   - **Benefit:** While moving left brings me closer to the apple at **(0, 7)**, this apple is farther away, requiring multiple moves to reach. This increases exposure to potential threats from enemy snakes and restricts immediate growth opportunities.\n   - **Strategic Consideration:** Less advantageous compared to moving DOWN due to the distance to the nearest apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 1):**  \n   - **Safety:** The position (2, 1) is empty (`.`) and safe to move into.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving right places me in proximity to the apple at **(2, 0)**.
