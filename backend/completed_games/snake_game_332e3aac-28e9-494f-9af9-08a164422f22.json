There's no immediate danger but I need to look out for enemy snake's move which could possibly post threat in future.\n\nGiven the current board state after my move, I should be able to safely reach the apple by continuing to go UP. As the enemy snake is still quite distant and current trajectory puts me away from the boundaries, this seems to be a safe strategy. \n\nHowever, I have to remember that after gaining the apple at (5,9), I need to make strategy for the next closest apple, which is at coordinates (8,8) or (5,6), depending upon the enemy's snake position and my relative position after gaining the apple at (5,9).\n\n\nNext move: UP.\n\n--End of your current move information.--"
