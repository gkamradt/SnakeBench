            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,8). There are apples at (6,3), (1,6), (8,9), (9,3), and (3,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,8), which is near the top-right corner. There's an apple at (8,9), which is one step up and to the left from my current position. There's another apple at (9,3), which is directly down from me.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the walls or the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,3), which is quite a bit away from me now, so maybe not an immediate threat.\n\nLet me think about my possible moves:\n\n1. **Up** to (9,9): That's off the board, which is a wall. So that's a bad move; I'll die.\n\n2. **Down** to (9,7): That seems safe; I need to check if there's any snake there or if I'll run into myself.\n\n3. **Left** to (8,8): Also seems safe; same checks apply.\n\n4. **Right** to (10,8): That's off the board too, another wall.\n\nSo, immediately, moving up or right is out because they lead to walls.\n\nThat leaves down or left.\n\nNow, considering the apples:\n\n- Moving down towards (9,3), which is directly below me, might be a good idea because there's an apple there.\n\n- Moving left towards (8,9) could also lead to an apple, but it's diagonally up and left.\n\nBut moving down to (9,7) doesn't directly lead to (9,3) in one move; it's a step in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) would bring me closer to the apple at (8,9).\n\nWait, let's think about the distances.\n\nFrom (9,8):\n\n- To (8,9): It's one left and one up.\n\n- To (9,3): It's five down.\n\n- To (6,3): It's three left and five down.\n\n- To (1,6): It's eight left and two up.\n\n- To (3,4): It's six left and four down.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,9), just one move left and one up, but up is a wall, so I can't go up.\n\nWait, but I can't go up because it's a wall. So, moving left to (8,8) would position me to potentially move up to (8,9) next turn, but again, up is a wall.\n\nWait, no, (8,9) is on the top row, which is Y=9, and moving up from (8,8) would be to (8,9), which is okay, as long as there's no snake there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the space at (8,9) is free and that I can actually reach the apple.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (4,3). If it's not moving, and it's small, maybe it's not a threat yet.\n\nBut I should prioritize not dying over eating apples.\n\nSo, perhaps I should move down to (9,7), away from the wall, and assess the situation better.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple, but I need to make sure that the space above me is clear.\n\nWait, but in the board state, position (8,9) is an apple, so it should be empty except for the apple.\n\nBut in the board state, row 9 is:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 8 at row 9 is a dot, which is empty, and column 9 at row 9 is an apple.\n\nSo, if I move left to (8,8), then up to (8,9), I can eat the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards that space.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (4,3), which is quite a distance away, and it's turn-based, perhaps it's safe for now.\n\nBut I should consider that the enemy could be moving towards me or the apples as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,7) puts me in a position where I can potentially move towards the apple at (9,3), but that's a longer path.\n\nWait, from (9,7), I can move left or down.\n\nBut down from (9,7) is (9,6), then (9,5), and so on, towards (9,3).\n\nBut that seems like a longer route compared to going left towards (8,9).\n\nAlso, there might be other apples that are closer or more strategic.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (9,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\nI'm at (9,8).\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is directly down, five steps.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is left one and up one, but up is a wall, so not feasible immediately.\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is six left and four down.\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is eight left and two up.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three left and five down.\n\nSo, perhaps the best immediate move is to move down to (9,7), towards the apple at (9,3), and then continue down to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), and finally (9,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . A . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (9,8) down to (9,7): row 7, column 9 is empty.\n\nThen (9,6): row 6, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,5): row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,4): row 4, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,3): row 3, column 9 is an apple.\n\nSo, the path from (9,8) to (9,3) is clear, except for the apple at (9,3).\n\nSo, I can move down to (9,7), then (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), and finally (9,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's five moves down.\n\nIn that time, the enemy snake at (4,3) might move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible movements.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8), then up to (8,9) to eat the apple there in two moves.\n\nFrom (8,9), I can then decide my next move.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,9) is an apple, and assuming no snake is there, I can eat it.\n\nAfter eating it, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't box myself in or create a path that my tail blocks my own way.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating the apple at (8,9), there might be better positions to move to.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,9), there are no other apples adjacent, so after eating that, I'd need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps towards (6,3) or (3,4).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, sticking to moving down towards (9,3) seems more direct.\n\nBut again, it's a longer path.\n\nMaybe a better strategy is to consider which apple is closest and least risky to reach.\n\nGiven that, the apple at (9,3) is directly down, with a clear path, and the enemy is at (4,3), which is horizontally to the left.\n\nSo, moving down towards (9,3), the enemy would have to move down and to the right to intercept me, but that seems unlikely in the short term.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (9,7) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to consider that after eating the apple at (8,9), I might have to move back down, which could be"

Apples are scattered around at various positions.\n\nLet me list out the possible moves I can make:\n\n1. **Up** to (9,8)\n\n2. **Down** to (9,6)\n\n3. **Left** to (8,7)\n\n4. **Right** to (10,7), but that's off the board, so that's invalid.\n\nSo, immediately, I can eliminate moving right because it's a wall.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options:\n\n- **Up to (9,8)**: I need to check if that spot is safe. Looking at the board state, position (9,8) is empty (denoted by a dot). Also, I need to make sure no other snakes are there. Since the enemy is at (5,3), which is elsewhere, it should be safe.\n\n- **Down to (9,6)**: Again, check if that spot is empty. From the board state, row 6 seems to have an apple at (6,3), but column 9 at row 6 is empty. So, it should be safe.\n\n- **Left to (8,7)**: Check if that spot is empty. From the board state, row 7, column 8 should be empty. So, it's safe.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the apples efficiently without dying.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the apples:\n\n- (6,3): That's quite a bit down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,6): That's way left and a bit down.\n\n- (8,9): That's left and up from me.\n\n- (9,3): Directly down from me.\n\n- (3,4): Left and down.\n\nGiven that, the closest apple seems to be (9,3), directly down from me. Let's calculate the distance:\n\nFrom (9,7) to (9,3):\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 3 = 4 steps down.\n\nSo, four steps down to reach it.\n\nAlternatively, (8,9) is one step left and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, if I move up from (9,7) to (9,8), that's towards (8,9), but I'd need to move left afterwards.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about potential paths to each apple.\n\n**Path to (9,3):**\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\n- Down to (9,4)\n\n- Down to (9,3)\n\nThat's four steps down.\n\nSeems straightforward, and the path is clear as per the board state.\n\n**Path to (8,9):**\n\n- Left to (8,7)\n\n- Up to (8,8)\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\nThat's two steps up after moving left once.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after moving left to (8,7), then up to (8,8), and then to (8,9), that those spaces are clear.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 7, column 8 is empty.\n\n- Row 8, column 8 is empty.\n\n- Row 9, column 8 has an apple, but that's (8,9), which is the apple position.\n\nSo, that path seems clear.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nGoing down to (9,3) is a direct path with no obstacles, and it's four steps.\n\nGoing to (8,9) is closer, only two steps up after moving left once.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,3), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path to the apples.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and assuming the enemy doesn't move immediately, I can plan my moves accordingly.\n\nBut I should consider what the enemy might do in the coming turns.\n\nIf I go down towards (9,3), the enemy would need to move up to intercept me, but it's at (5,3), which is quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go left towards (8,9), the enemy might try to move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closer apple at (8,9) is better, as it's quicker to reach.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nSo, to get to (8,9), I need to:\n\n1. Move left to (8,7)\n\n2. Then up to (8,8)\n\n3. Then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,8), then left to (8,8), then up to (8,9).\n\nBut moving up from (9,7) to (9,8) is okay, as it's within bounds and empty.\n\nThen left to (8,8), and then up to (8,9).\n\nEither way, it's three moves.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is safer, as moving up to (9,8) might put me in a position where the enemy could potentially move up and interfere, although it's unlikely given the distance.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (5,3), and I'm at (9,7). The enemy would have to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several turns.\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to go for (8,9).\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating (8,9), I can potentially move towards another apple, like (9,3) or (6,3), depending on the board state.\n\nBut, let's not plan too far ahead. For now, focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to move left to (8,7).\n\nThen, next turn, move up to (8,8), and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,3) directly, as it's directly down and a clear path.\n\nBut (8,9) is closer, only three moves away, whereas (9,3) is four moves down.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (8,9) is faster.\n\nBut, I also need to consider that after eating (8,9), I might have to move back down towards another apple, which could be inefficient.\n\nWait, after eating (8,9), I could potentially move towards (6,3) or (3,4), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,3) and then perhaps moving towards another apple.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about points.\n\nEach apple gives me one point, so the more apples I eat, the more points I get.\n\nBut I need to balance between eating apples quickly and not dying.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closest apple first is the best strategy.\n\nSo, moving left to (8,7), then up to (8,8), then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, let's just focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to move left to (8,7).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving left to (8,7), I'll then move up to (8,8), and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,8). There are apples at (6,3), (1,6), (8,9), (9,3), and (3,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,8), which is near the top-right corner. There's an apple at (8,9), which is one step up and to the left from my current position. There's another apple at (9,3), which is directly down from me.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the walls or the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,3), which is quite a bit away from me now, so maybe not an immediate threat.\n\nLet me think about my possible moves:\n\n1. **Up** to (9,9): That's off the board, which is a wall. So that's a bad move; I'll die.\n\n2. **Down** to (9,7): That seems safe; I need to check if there's any snake there or if I'll run into myself.\n\n3. **Left** to (8,8): Also seems safe; same checks apply.\n\n4. **Right** to (10,8): That's off the board too, another wall.\n\nSo, immediately, moving up or right is out because they lead to walls.\n\nThat leaves down or left.\n\nNow, considering the apples:\n\n- Moving down towards (9,3), which is directly below me, might be a good idea because there's an apple there.\n\n- Moving left towards (8,9) could also lead to an apple, but it's diagonally up and left.\n\nBut moving down to (9,7) doesn't directly lead to (9,3) in one move; it's a step in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) would bring me closer to the apple at (8,9).\n\nWait, let's think about the distances.\n\nFrom (9,8):\n\n- To (8,9): It's one left and one up.\n\n- To (9,3): It's five down.\n\n- To (6,3): It's three left and five down.\n\n- To (1,6): It's eight left and two up.\n\n- To (3,4): It's six left and four down.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,9), just one move left and one up, but up is a wall, so I can't go up.\n\nWait, but I can't go up because it's a wall. So, moving left to (8,8) would position me to potentially move up to (8,9) next turn, but again, up is a wall.\n\nWait, no, (8,9) is on the top row, which is Y=9, and moving up from (8,8) would be to (8,9), which is okay, as long as there's no snake there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the space at (8,9) is free and that I can actually reach the apple.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (4,3). If it's not moving, and it's small, maybe it's not a threat yet.\n\nBut I should prioritize not dying over eating apples.\n\nSo, perhaps I should move down to (9,7), away from the wall, and assess the situation better.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple, but I need to make sure that the space above me is clear.\n\nWait, but in the board state, position (8,9) is an apple, so it should be empty except for the apple.\n\nBut in the board state, row 9 is:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 8 at row 9 is a dot, which is empty, and column 9 at row 9 is an apple.\n\nSo, if I move left to (8,8), then up to (8,9), I can eat the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards that space.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (4,3), which is quite a distance away, and it's turn-based, perhaps it's safe for now.\n\nBut I should consider that the enemy could be moving towards me or the apples as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,7) puts me in a position where I can potentially move towards the apple at (9,3), but that's a longer path.\n\nWait, from (9,7), I can move left or down.\n\nBut down from (9,7) is (9,6), then (9,5), and so on, towards (9,3).\n\nBut that seems like a longer route compared to going left towards (8,9).\n\nAlso, there might be other apples that are closer or more strategic.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (9,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\nI'm at (9,8).\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is directly down, five steps.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is left one and up one, but up is a wall, so not feasible immediately.\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is six left and four down.\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is eight left and two up.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three left and five down.\n\nSo, perhaps the best immediate move is to move down to (9,7), towards the apple at (9,3), and then continue down to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), and finally (9,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . A . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (9,8) down to (9,7): row 7, column 9 is empty.\n\nThen (9,6): row 6, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,5): row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,4): row 4, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,3): row 3, column 9 is an apple.\n\nSo, the path from (9,8) to (9,3) is clear, except for the apple at (9,3).\n\nSo, I can move down to (9,7), then (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), and finally (9,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's five moves down.\n\nIn that time, the enemy snake at (4,3) might move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible movements.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8), then up to (8,9) to eat the apple there in two moves.\n\nFrom (8,9), I can then decide my next move.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,9) is an apple, and assuming no snake is there, I can eat it.\n\nAfter eating it, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't box myself in or create a path that my tail blocks my own way.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating the apple at (8,9), there might be better positions to move to.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,9), there are no other apples adjacent, so after eating that, I'd need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps towards (6,3) or (3,4).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, sticking to moving down towards (9,3) seems more direct.\n\nBut again, it's a longer path.\n\nMaybe a better strategy is to consider which apple is closest and least risky to reach.\n\nGiven that, the apple at (9,3) is directly down, with a clear path, and the enemy is at (4,3), which is horizontally to the left.\n\nSo, moving down towards (9,3), the enemy would have to move down and to the right to intercept me, but that seems unlikely in the short term.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (9,7) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to consider that after eating the apple at (8,9), I might have to move back down, which could be"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. I'm snake number 2, currently at position (8,7). There are apples at (6,3), (1,6), (8,9), (9,3), and (3,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (5,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout and visualize where everything is. Let's sketch it out mentally:\n\n- The Y-axis increases upwards, so higher Y values are higher on the grid.\n\n- The X-axis increases to the right, so higher X values are further right.\n\nI'm at (8,7), which is towards the top-right corner. Apples are scattered around at various positions.\n\nLet me list out the possible moves I can make:\n\n1. **Up** to (8,8)\n\n2. **Down** to (8,6)\n\n3. **Left** to (7,7)\n\n4. **Right** to (9,7)\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each of these options based on safety and proximity to apples.\n\n- **Up to (8,8)**: Let's see, from the board state, position (8,8) is empty. I need to make sure it's safe and that there are no snakes there. The enemy is at (5,4), which is not close to (8,8), so it should be safe.\n\n- **Down to (8,6)**: Checking the board state, (8,6) seems to be empty. Again, the enemy is not nearby, so it should be safe.\n\n- **Left to (7,7)**: Position (7,7) is empty, and no snakes are there.\n\n- **Right to (9,7)**: Position (9,7) is empty, and no snakes are there.\n\nSo, all directions seem safe for the immediate move. Now, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the apples:\n\n- (6,3): That's quite a bit down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,6): That's way left and a bit down.\n\n- (8,9): That's up from me.\n\n- (9,3): Down and right.\n\n- (3,4): Left and down.\n\nI need to think about which apple is closest and easiest to reach without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid-based movement.\n\n- To (6,3):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-6| = 2\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-3| = 4\n\n  - Total: 6\n\n- To (1,6):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-1| = 7\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-6| = 1\n\n  - Total: 8\n\n- To (8,9):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-8| = 0\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-9| = 2\n\n  - Total: 2\n\n- To (9,3):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-9| = 1\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-3| = 4\n\n  - Total: 5\n\n- To (3,4):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-3| = 5\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-4| = 3\n\n  - Total: 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,9) with a distance of 2, followed by (9,3) at 5, and (6,3) at 6. The other apples are farther away.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for the closest apple at (8,9). To get there, I need to move up twice from my current position.\n\nBut before deciding, I should consider the enemy's position and potential movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,4). If I move up to (8,8), then up to (8,9), I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't intercept me.\n\nLet's see the distance from the enemy to (8,9):\n\n- Delta X: |5-8| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |4-9| = 5\n\n- Total: 8\n\nThe enemy is quite a distance away, and it would take several moves for them to reach (8,9). Plus, they might have their own apples to go for.\n\nTherefore, it seems safe to proceed towards (8,9).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (8,8), then up again to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut since I can only make one move at a time, I'll choose to move up to (8,8) this turn, planning to move up again next turn to eat the apple.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction could lead to a better position.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up seems straightforward and safe. There are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move right to (9,7), I could potentially head towards (9,3), but that's farther away than (8,9).\n\nSimilarly, moving down or left wouldn't bring me closer to any apple as efficiently as moving up to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, moving up to (8,8) is the best choice for now.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving up to (8,8), I'll then move up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

There are apples at (6,3), (1,6), (8,9), (9,3), and (3,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,8), which is near the top-right corner. There's an apple at (8,9), which is one step up and to the left from my current position. There's another apple at (9,3), which is directly down from me.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the walls or the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,3), which is quite a bit away from me now, so maybe not an immediate threat.\n\nLet me think about my possible moves:\n\n1. **Up** to (9,9): That's off the board, which is a wall. So that's a bad move; I'll die.\n\n2. **Down** to (9,7): That seems safe; I need to check if there's any snake there or if I'll run into myself.\n\n3. **Left** to (8,8): Also seems safe; same checks apply.\n\n4. **Right** to (10,8): That's off the board too, another wall.\n\nSo, immediately, moving up or right is out because they lead to walls.\n\nThat leaves down or left.\n\nNow, considering the apples:\n\n- Moving down towards (9,3), which is directly below me, might be a good idea because there's an apple there.\n\n- Moving left towards (8,9) could also lead to an apple, but it's diagonally up and left.\n\nBut moving down to (9,7) doesn't directly lead to (9,3) in one move; it's a step in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) would bring me closer to the apple at (8,9).\n\nWait, let's think about the distances.\n\nFrom (9,8):\n\n- To (8,9): It's one left and one up.\n\n- To (9,3): It's five down.\n\n- To (6,3): It's three left and five down.\n\n- To (1,6): It's eight left and two up.\n\n- To (3,4): It's six left and four down.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,9), just one move left and one up, but up is a wall, so I can't go up.\n\nWait, but I can't go up because it's a wall. So, moving left to (8,8) would position me to potentially move up to (8,9) next turn, but again, up is a wall.\n\nWait, no, (8,9) is on the top row, which is Y=9, and moving up from (8,8) would be to (8,9), which is okay, as long as there's no snake there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the space at (8,9) is free and that I can actually reach the apple.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (4,3). If it's not moving, and it's small, maybe it's not a threat yet.\n\nBut I should prioritize not dying over eating apples.\n\nSo, perhaps I should move down to (9,7), away from the wall, and assess the situation better.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple, but I need to make sure that the space above me is clear.\n\nWait, but in the board state, position (8,9) is an apple, so it should be empty except for the apple.\n\nBut in the board state, row 9 is:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 8 at row 9 is a dot, which is empty, and column 9 at row 9 is an apple.\n\nSo, if I move left to (8,8), then up to (8,9), I can eat the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards that space.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (4,3), which is quite a distance away, and it's turn-based, perhaps it's safe for now.\n\nBut I should consider that the enemy could be moving towards me or the apples as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,7) puts me in a position where I can potentially move towards the apple at (9,3), but that's a longer path.\n\nWait, from (9,7), I can move left or down.\n\nBut down from (9,7) is (9,6), then (9,5), and so on, towards (9,3).\n\nBut that seems like a longer route compared to going left towards (8,9).\n\nAlso, there might be other apples that are closer or more strategic.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (9,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\nI'm at (9,8).\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is directly down, five steps.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is left one and up one, but up is a wall, so not feasible immediately.\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is six left and four down.\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is eight left and two up.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three left and five down.\n\nSo, perhaps the best immediate move is to move down to (9,7), towards the apple at (9,3), and then continue down to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), and finally (9,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . 1 . A . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (9,8) down to (9,7): row 7, column 9 is empty.\n\nThen (9,6): row 6, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,5): row 5, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,4): row 4, column 9 is empty.\n\n(9,3): row 3, column 9 is an apple.\n\nSo, the path from (9,8) to (9,3) is clear, except for the apple at (9,3).\n\nSo, I can move down to (9,7), then (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), and finally (9,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's five moves down.\n\nIn that time, the enemy snake at (4,3) might move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible movements.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8), then up to (8,9) to eat the apple there in two moves.\n\nFrom (8,9), I can then decide my next move.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,9) is an apple, and assuming no snake is there, I can eat it.\n\nAfter eating it, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't box myself in or create a path that my tail blocks my own way.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating the apple at (8,9), there might be better positions to move to.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,9), there are no other apples adjacent, so after eating that, I'd need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps towards (6,3) or (3,4).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, sticking to moving down towards (9,3) seems more direct.\n\nBut again, it's a longer path.\n\nMaybe a better strategy is to consider which apple is closest and least risky to reach.\n\nGiven that, the apple at (9,3) is directly down, with a clear path, and the enemy is at (4,3), which is horizontally to the left.\n\nSo, moving down towards (9,3), the enemy would have to move down and to the right to intercept me, but that seems unlikely in the short term.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (9,7) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to consider that after eating the apple at (8,9), I might have to move back down, which could be"

From the board state, row 6 seems to have an apple at (6,3), but column 9 at row 6 is empty. So, it should be safe.\n\n- **Left to (8,7)**: Check if that spot is empty. From the board state, row 7, column 8 should be empty.

Let's calculate the distance:\n\nFrom (9,7) to (9,3):\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 3 = 4 steps down.\n\nSo, four steps down to reach it.\n\nAlternatively, (8,9) is one step left and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, if I move up from (9,7) to (9,8), that's towards (8,9), but I'd need to move left afterwards.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about potential paths to each apple.\n\n**Path to (9,3):**\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\n- Down to (9,4)\n\n- Down to (9,3)\n\nThat's four steps down.\n\nSeems straightforward, and the path is clear as per the board state.\n\n**Path to (8,9):**\n\n- Left to (8,7)\n\n- Up to (8,8)\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\nThat's two steps up after moving left once.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after moving left to (8,7), then up to (8,8), and then to (8,9), that those spaces are clear.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 7, column 8 is empty.\n\n- Row 8, column 8 is empty.\n\n- Row 9, column 8 has an apple, but that's (8,9), which is the apple position.\n\nSo, that path seems clear.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nGoing down to (9,3) is a direct path with no obstacles, and it's four steps.\n\nGoing to (8,9) is closer, only two steps up after moving left once.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,3), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path to the apples.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and assuming the enemy doesn't move immediately, I can plan my moves accordingly.\n\nBut I should consider what the enemy might do in the coming turns.\n\nIf I go down towards (9,3), the enemy would need to move up to intercept me, but it's at (5,3), which is quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go left towards (8,9), the enemy might try to move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closer apple at (8,9) is better, as it's quicker to reach.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nSo, to get to (8,9), I need to:\n\n1.

The enemy would have to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several turns.\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to go for (8,9).\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating (8,9), I can potentially move towards another apple, like (9,3) or (6,3), depending on the board state.\n\nBut, let's not plan too far ahead. For now, focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to move left to (8,7).\n\nThen, next turn, move up to (8,8), and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,3) directly, as it's directly down and a clear path.\n\nBut (8,9) is closer, only three moves away, whereas (9,3) is four moves down.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (8,9) is faster.\n\nBut, I also need to consider that after eating (8,9), I might have to move back down towards another apple, which could be inefficient.\n\nWait, after eating (8,9), I could potentially move towards (6,3) or (3,4), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,3) and then perhaps moving towards another apple.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about points.\n\nEach apple gives me one point, so the more apples I eat, the more points I get.\n\nBut I need to balance between eating apples quickly and not dying.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closest apple first is the best strategy.\n\nSo, moving left to (8,7), then up to (8,8), then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, let's just focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to move left to (8,7).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving left to (8,7), I'll then move up to (8,8), and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

Again, the enemy is not nearby, so it should be safe.\n\n- **Left to (7,7)**: Position (7,7) is empty, and no snakes are there.\n\n- **Right to (9,7)**: Position (9,7) is empty, and no snakes are there.\n\nSo, all directions seem safe for the immediate move. Now, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the apples:\n\n- (6,3): That's quite a bit down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,6): That's way left and a bit down.\n\n- (8,9): That's up from me.\n\n- (9,3): Down and right.\n\n- (3,4): Left and down.\n\nI need to think about which apple is closest and easiest to reach without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid-based movement.\n\n- To (6,3):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-6| = 2\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-3| = 4\n\n  - Total: 6\n\n- To (1,6):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-1| = 7\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-6| = 1\n\n  - Total: 8\n\n- To (8,9):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-8| = 0\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-9| = 2\n\n  - Total: 2\n\n- To (9,3):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-9| = 1\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-3| = 4\n\n  - Total: 5\n\n- To (3,4):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-3| = 5\n\n  - Delta Y: |7-4| = 3\n\n  - Total: 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,9) with a distance of 2, followed by (9,3) at 5, and (6,3) at 6. The other apples are farther away.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for the closest apple at (8,9). To get there, I need to move up twice from my current position.\n\nBut before deciding, I should consider the enemy's position and potential movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,4). If I move up to (8,8), then up to (8,9), I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't intercept me.\n\nLet's see the distance from the enemy to (8,9):\n\n- Delta X: |5-8| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |4-9| = 5\n\n- Total: 8\n\nThe enemy is quite a distance away, and it would take several moves for them to reach (8,9). Plus, they might have their own apples to go for.\n\nTherefore, it seems safe to proceed towards (8,9).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (8,8), then up again to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut since I can only make one move at a time, I'll choose to move up to (8,8) this turn, planning to move up again next turn to eat the apple.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction could lead to a better position.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up seems straightforward and safe. There are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move right to (9,7), I could potentially head towards (9,3), but that's farther away than (8,9).\n\nSimilarly, moving down or left wouldn't bring me closer to any apple as efficiently as moving up to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, moving up to (8,8) is the best choice for now.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving up to (8,8), I'll then move up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

But if I go for the apple at (1, 6), I'll be moving away from the apple at (3, 4).\n\nHmm...

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. I'm snake number 2, currently at position (8,8). There are apples at (6,3), (1,6), (8,9), (9,3), and (3,4). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (5,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout and visualize where everything is. Let's sketch it out mentally:\n\n- The Y-axis increases upwards, so higher Y values are higher on the grid.\n\n- The X-axis increases to the right, so higher X values are further right.\n\nI'm at (8,8), which is towards the top-right corner. Apples are scattered around at various positions.\n\nLet me list out the possible moves I can make:\n\n1. **Up** to (8,9)\n\n2. **Down** to (8,7)\n\n3. **Left** to (7,8)\n\n4. **Right** to (9,8)\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each of these options based on safety and proximity to apples.\n\n- **Up to (8,9)**: Let's see, from the board state, position (8,9) has an apple. That's great! I can eat it and grow longer.\n\n- **Down to (8,7)**: Position (8,7) is empty. I need to make sure it's safe and that there are no snakes there.\n\n- **Left to (7,8)**: Position (7,8) is empty, and no snakes are there.\n\n- **Right to (9,8)**: Position (9,8) is empty, and no snakes are there.\n\nSo, all directions seem safe for the immediate move. Now, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the apples:\n\n- (6,3): That's quite a bit down and left from my current position.\n\n- (1,6): That's way left and a bit down.\n\n- (8,9): That's up from me.\n\n- (9,3): Down and right.\n\n- (3,4): Left and down.\n\nI need to think about which apple is closest and easiest to reach without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid-based movement.\n\n- To (6,3):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-6| = 2\n\n  - Delta Y: |8-3| = 5\n\n  - Total: 7\n\n- To (1,6):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-1| = 7\n\n  - Delta Y: |8-6| = 2\n\n  - Total: 9\n\n- To (8,9):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-8| = 0\n\n  - Delta Y: |8-9| = 1\n\n  - Total: 1\n\n- To (9,3):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-9| = 1\n\n  - Delta Y: |8-3| = 5\n\n  - Total: 6\n\n- To (3,4):\n\n  - Delta X: |8-3| = 5\n\n  - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n  - Total: 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,9) with a distance of 1, which is right above me. That's perfect because it's just one move away.\n\nNow, I need to consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction could lead to a better position.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,5). If I move up to (8,9), I'm moving further away from the enemy, which is good. The enemy would have to cover more ground to reach me, giving me more time to collect more apples.\n\nAlso, by eating the apple at (8,9), I'll grow longer, which could be an advantage in case the enemy tries to approach me.\n\nMoreover, after eating the apple at (8,9), I can consider moving right to (9,9), but there are no apples there immediately. Alternatively, I could move up if possible, but since Y=9 is the top, I can't go higher.\n\nWait, Y=9 is the top, so I can't go up from (8,9) to (8,10). So after eating the apple at (8,9), my next moves would be either right to (9,9) or down to (8,8), but (8,8) is where I am now, which might not be ideal if I'm growing.\n\nActually, when I eat the apple at (8,9), my tail will stay at (8,8), so moving down to (8,8) would be moving back onto my own tail, which would kill me.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (8,9), I should probably move right to (9,9), and then decide my next move from there.\n\nLooking ahead, from (9,9), I could move down to (9,8), then (9,7), and so on, but there are no apples in that direction immediately. Alternatively, I could move left back to (8,9), but that wouldn't make sense because I'd be stuck in a loop.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (8,9), I should consider moving down to (8,7) and see what's there.\n\nWait, but (8,7) is empty, and there are no apples nearby. Maybe I should look for the next closest apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), the next closest apple would be (9,3), which is quite far down and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving to (9,8) after eating (8,9), but that doesn't seem immediately beneficial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider a different approach. Maybe I should aim for multiple apples in a sequence that allows me to cover more ground efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the positions again:\n\n- Current position: (8,8)\n\n- Apples: (6,3), (1,6), (8,9), (9,3), (3,4)\n\nIf I take (8,9), then maybe move to (9,9), but there's no apple there. Then, perhaps move down to (9,8), then (9,7), and so on, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I ignore (8,9) for now and go for a different apple, maybe I can cover more ground.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (9,3). To get there from (8,8), I need to move down to (8,7), then (8,6), and so on, down to (8,3), then right to (9,3).\n\nThat would take several moves, and during that time, the enemy could potentially move towards me or towards an apple.\n\nSimilarly, going for (6,3) would require moving left to (7,8), then (6,8), down to (6,7), and so on, which is also time-consuming.\n\nGiven that, it still seems best to go for the closest apple first, which is (8,9), and then reassess from there.\n\nMoreover, by moving up to (8,9), I'm expanding my territory upwards, where there are no other snakes or obstacles immediately.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's possible movements. The enemy is at (5,5). If I move up to (8,9), the enemy would need to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several turns.\n\nIn the meantime, I can try to secure more apples and extend my length.\n\nAnother consideration is that by moving up, I might be able to block the enemy's path to certain apples, depending on where they're headed.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy's strategy, it's hard to predict their moves accurately.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best immediate move is to go up to (8,9) and eat that apple.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving up to (8,9), I'll need to decide where to go next. Since moving up further isn't possible, I'll consider moving right to (9,9), then down to (9,8), and so on, looking for the next closest apple.\n\nBut perhaps a better strategy would be to move down to (8,7) and then consider moving right or left based on the positions of the remaining apples.\n\nI'll have to evaluate again once I've eaten the apple at (8,9).\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

There are apples at (6,3), (1,6), (8,9), (9,3), and (3,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,3) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,8), which is near the top-right corner. There's an apple at (8,9), which is one step up and to the left from my current position. There's another apple at (9,3), which is directly down from me.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the walls or the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,3), which is quite a bit away from me now, so maybe not an immediate threat.\n\nLet me think about my possible moves:\n\n1. **Up** to (9,9): That's off the board, which is a wall. So that's a bad move; I'll die.\n\n2. **Down** to (9,7): That seems safe; I need to check if there's any snake there or if I'll run into myself.\n\n3. **Left** to (8,8): Also seems safe; same checks apply.\n\n4. **Right** to (10,8): That's off the board too, another wall.\n\nSo, immediately, moving up or right is out because they lead to walls.\n\nThat leaves down or left.\n\nNow, considering the apples:\n\n- Moving down towards (9,3), which is directly below me, might be a good idea because there's an apple there.\n\n- Moving left towards (8,9) could also lead to an apple, but it's diagonally up and left.\n\nBut moving down to (9,7) doesn't directly lead to (9,3) in one move; it's a step in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) would bring me closer to the apple at (8,9).\n\nWait, let's think about the distances.\n\nFrom (9,8):\n\n- To (8,9): It's one left and one up.\n\n- To (9,3): It's five down.\n\n- To (6,3): It's three left and five down.\n\n- To (1,6): It's eight left and two up.\n\n- To (3,4): It's six left and four down.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,9), just one move left and one up, but up is a wall, so I can't go up.\n\nWait, but I can't go up because it's a wall. So, moving left to (8,8) would position me to potentially move up to (8,9) next turn, but again, up is a wall.\n\nWait, no, (8,9) is on the top row, which is Y=9, and moving up from (8,8) would be to (8,9), which is okay, as long as there's no snake there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the space at (8,9) is free and that I can actually reach the apple.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (4,3). If it's not moving, and it's small, maybe it's not a threat yet.\n\nBut I should prioritize not dying over eating apples.\n\nSo, perhaps I should move down to (9,7), away from the wall, and assess the situation better.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,8) and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple, but I need to make sure that the space above me is clear.\n\nWait, but in the board state, position (8,9) is an apple, so it should be empty except for the apple.\n\nBut in the board state, row 9 is:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 8 at row 9 is a dot, which is empty, and column 9 at row 9 is an apple.\n\nSo, if I move left to (8,8), then up to (8,9), I can eat the apple at (8,9).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards that space.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (4,3), which is quite a distance away, and it's turn-based, perhaps it's safe for now.\n\nBut I should consider that the enemy could be moving towards me or the apples as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,7) puts me in a position where I can potentially move towards the apple at (9,3), but that's a longer path.\n\nWait, from (9,7), I can move left or down.\n\nBut down from (9,7) is (9,6), then (9,5), and so on, towards (9,3).\n\nBut that seems like a longer route compared to going left towards (8,9).\n\nAlso, there might be other apples that are closer or more strategic.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (9,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\nI'm at (9,8).\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is directly down, five steps.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is left one and up one, but up is a wall, so not feasible immediately.\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is six left and four down.\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is eight left and two up.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three left and five down.\n\nSo, perhaps the best immediate move is to move down to (9,7), towards the apple at (9,3), and then continue down to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), and finally (9,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: .

Let's calculate the distance:\n\nFrom (9,7) to (9,3):\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 3 = 4 steps down.\n\nSo, four steps down to reach it.\n\nAlternatively, (8,9) is one step left and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, if I move up from (9,7) to (9,8), that's towards (8,9), but I'd need to move left afterwards.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about potential paths to each apple.\n\n**Path to (9,3):**\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\n- Down to (9,5)\n\n- Down to (9,4)\n\n- Down to (9,3)\n\nThat's four steps down.\n\nSeems straightforward, and the path is clear as per the board state.\n\n**Path to (8,9):**\n\n- Left to (8,7)\n\n- Up to (8,8)\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\nThat's two steps up after moving left once.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after moving left to (8,7), then up to (8,8), and then to (8,9), that those spaces are clear.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 7, column 8 is empty.\n\n- Row 8, column 8 is empty.\n\n- Row 9, column 8 has an apple, but that's (8,9), which is the apple position.\n\nSo, that path seems clear.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nGoing down to (9,3) is a direct path with no obstacles, and it's four steps.\n\nGoing to (8,9) is closer, only two steps up after moving left once.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,3), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path to the apples.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and assuming the enemy doesn't move immediately, I can plan my moves accordingly.\n\nBut I should consider what the enemy might do in the coming turns.\n\nIf I go down towards (9,3), the enemy would need to move up to intercept me, but it's at (5,3), which is quite a distance away.\n\nAlternatively, if I go left towards (8,9), the enemy might try to move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closer apple at (8,9) is better, as it's quicker to reach.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nSo, to get to (8,9), I need to:\n\n1. Move left to (8,7)\n\n2. Then up to (8,8)\n\n3. Then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,8), then left to (8,8), then up to (8,9).\n\nBut moving up from (9,7) to (9,8) is okay, as it's within bounds and empty.\n\nThen left to (8,8), and then up to (8,9).\n\nEither way, it's three moves.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is safer, as moving up to (9,8) might put me in a position where the enemy could potentially move up and interfere, although it's unlikely given the distance.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (5,3), and I'm at (9,7). The enemy would have to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several turns.\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to go for (8,9).\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating (8,9), I can potentially move towards another apple, like (9,3) or (6,3), depending on the board state.\n\nBut, let's not plan too far ahead. For now, focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to move left to (8,7).\n\nThen, next turn, move up to (8,8), and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (9,3) directly, as it's directly down and a clear path.\n\nBut (8,9) is closer, only three moves away, whereas (9,3) is four moves down.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (8,9) is faster.\n\nBut, I also need to consider that after eating (8,9), I might have to move back down towards another apple, which could be inefficient.\n\nWait, after eating (8,9), I could potentially move towards (6,3) or (3,4), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,3) and then perhaps moving towards another apple.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about points.\n\nEach apple gives me one point, so the more apples I eat, the more points I get.\n\nBut I need to balance between eating apples quickly and not dying.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closest apple first is the best strategy.\n\nSo, moving left to (8,7), then up to (8,8), then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, let's just focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to move left to (8,7).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving left to (8,7), I'll then move up to (8,8), and then up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

The other apples are farther away.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for the closest apple at (8,9). To get there, I need to move up twice from my current position.\n\nBut before deciding, I should consider the enemy's position and potential movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,4). If I move up to (8,8), then up to (8,9), I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't intercept me.\n\nLet's see the distance from the enemy to (8,9):\n\n- Delta X: |5-8| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |4-9| = 5\n\n- Total: 8\n\nThe enemy is quite a distance away, and it would take several moves for them to reach (8,9). Plus, they might have their own apples to go for.\n\nTherefore, it seems safe to proceed towards (8,9).\n\nSo, my immediate move should be up to (8,8), then up again to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut since I can only make one move at a time, I'll choose to move up to (8,8) this turn, planning to move up again next turn to eat the apple.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction could lead to a better position.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up seems straightforward and safe. There are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move right to (9,7), I could potentially head towards (9,3), but that's farther away than (8,9).\n\nSimilarly, moving down or left wouldn't bring me closer to any apple as efficiently as moving up to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, moving up to (8,8) is the best choice for now.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving up to (8,8), I'll then move up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

That's perfect because it's just one move away.\n\nNow, I need to consider if there are any immediate threats or if moving in another direction could lead to a better position.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,5). If I move up to (8,9), I'm moving further away from the enemy, which is good. The enemy would have to cover more ground to reach me, giving me more time to collect more apples.\n\nAlso, by eating the apple at (8,9), I'll grow longer, which could be an advantage in case the enemy tries to approach me.\n\nMoreover, after eating the apple at (8,9), I can consider moving right to (9,9), but there are no apples there immediately. Alternatively, I could move up if possible, but since Y=9 is the top, I can't go higher.\n\nWait, Y=9 is the top, so I can't go up from (8,9) to (8,10). So after eating the apple at (8,9), my next moves would be either right to (9,9) or down to (8,8), but (8,8) is where I am now, which might not be ideal if I'm growing.\n\nActually, when I eat the apple at (8,9), my tail will stay at (8,8), so moving down to (8,8) would be moving back onto my own tail, which would kill me.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (8,9), I should probably move right to (9,9), and then decide my next move from there.\n\nLooking ahead, from (9,9), I could move down to (9,8), then (9,7), and so on, but there are no apples in that direction immediately. Alternatively, I could move left back to (8,9), but that wouldn't make sense because I'd be stuck in a loop.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (8,9), I should consider moving down to (8,7) and see what's there.\n\nWait, but (8,7) is empty, and there are no apples nearby. Maybe I should look for the next closest apple.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), the next closest apple would be (9,3), which is quite far down and to the right.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving to (9,8) after eating (8,9), but that doesn't seem immediately beneficial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider a different approach. Maybe I should aim for multiple apples in a sequence that allows me to cover more ground efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the positions again:\n\n- Current position: (8,8)\n\n- Apples: (6,3), (1,6), (8,9), (9,3), (3,4)\n\nIf I take (8,9), then maybe move to (9,9), but there's no apple there. Then, perhaps move down to (9,8), then (9,7), and so on, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I ignore (8,9) for now and go for a different apple, maybe I can cover more ground.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (9,3). To get there from (8,8), I need to move down to (8,7), then (8,6), and so on, down to (8,3), then right to (9,3).\n\nThat would take several moves, and during that time, the enemy could potentially move towards me or towards an apple.\n\nSimilarly, going for (6,3) would require moving left to (7,8), then (6,8), down to (6,7), and so on, which is also time-consuming.\n\nGiven that, it still seems best to go for the closest apple first, which is (8,9), and then reassess from there.\n\nMoreover, by moving up to (8,9), I'm expanding my territory upwards, where there are no other snakes or obstacles immediately.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's possible movements. The enemy is at (5,5). If I move up to (8,9), the enemy would need to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several turns.\n\nIn the meantime, I can try to secure more apples and extend my length.\n\nAnother consideration is that by moving up, I might be able to block the enemy's path to certain apples, depending on where they're headed.\n\nHowever, without knowing the enemy's strategy, it's hard to predict their moves accurately.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best immediate move is to go up to (8,9) and eat that apple.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving up to (8,9), I'll need to decide where to go next. Since moving up further isn't possible, I'll consider moving right to (9,9), then down to (9,8), and so on, looking for the next closest apple.\n\nBut perhaps a better strategy would be to move down to (8,7) and then consider moving right or left based on the positions of the remaining apples.\n\nI'll have to evaluate again once I've eaten the apple at (8,9).\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

To get there from (8,9), I need to move down to (8,8), then (8,7), and so on, down to (8,3), then right to (9,3).\n\nThat's a total of 6 moves down and 1 move right, totaling 7 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that the enemy doesn't intercept me.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (4,5), if I move down to (8,8), then (8,7), and so on, the enemy would have to cover a certain distance to reach me.\n\nLet's calculate the enemy's distance to my path.\n\n- Enemy at (4,5)\n\n- My path to (9,3):\n\n  - (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (9,3)\n\nLet's see the Manhattan distance from enemy to my path:\n\n- To (8,8): |4-8| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- To (8,7): |4-8| + |5-7| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- To (8,6): |4-8| + |5-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (8,5): |4-8| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- To (8,4): |4-8| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (8,3): |4-8| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- To (9,3): |4-9| + |5-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSo, the enemy's closest point to my path is (8,5), which is 4 moves away.\n\nAssuming I move down to (8,8), then (8,7), etc., and the enemy moves towards me, I should have enough time to reach (8,3) and then (9,3) before the enemy can intercept me.\n\nBut I need to consider that the enemy might have a different strategy or might be moving towards a different apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better path to (9,3) that's safer or shorter.\n\nLet me consider moving right to (9,9), then down to (9,8), (9,7), etc., to (9,3). That would be 6 moves down from (9,9) to (9,3), plus the initial move right to (9,9), totaling 7 moves, same as the direct path.\n\nBut moving along the right edge might put me closer to other apples or further away from the enemy, depending on its movements.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (9,3), so that's a good target.\n\nBut also, there's an apple at (6,3). If I go to (9,3), I can then consider moving left to (6,3), but that would be a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for multiple apples in one path.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (8,9), move down to (8,8), then (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), then right to (9,3). That's 7 moves to (9,3).\n\nAfter eating (9,3), I can consider moving left to (6,3), but that's another 3 moves left to (6,3), then perhaps up or down to other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, after eating (9,3), my tail will be at (8,3), so moving left to (7,3), then (6,3), I need to ensure that I don't run over my own body.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into my own tail.\n\nThis seems complicated, and I might not have enough time to calculate all possible moves.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLooking back at the apples:\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (9,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (2,5)\n\nI notice that (6,3), (3,4), and (2,5) are all in the lower left area, while (1,6) is even further left and up a bit.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim for (9,3), which is closer, and then decide whether to go for (6,3) or another apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and potential movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,5). If I go down to (8,5), that's where the enemy is, so I need to be careful.\n\nWait, but I'm planning to go down to (8,3), which is below the enemy.\n\nSo, perhaps the enemy would have to move down to intercept me, but I'm moving down as well.\n\nIt's tricky to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (2,5), which is left and down.\n\nBut that's further away, with a Manhattan distance of 6 + 4 = 10 moves.\n\nThat seems too slow, especially with the enemy potentially moving towards me.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the"
