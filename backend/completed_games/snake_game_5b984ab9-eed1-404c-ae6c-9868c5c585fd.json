Looking at the board, I can see that there are several apples available, with one at (8, 9), one at (8, 5), one at (3, 5), one at (7, 9), and one at (6, 2). My snake is currently at (9, 4), and the enemy snake is at (3, 0).\n\nGiven that my snake is at the top right corner of the board, I have limited options for moving up or left without running into a wall. Moving down or right would put me closer to the apples, but I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's position.\n\nI think the best strategy here would be to move RIGHT, as that will bring me closer to the apple at (8, 5) without putting me in immediate danger. This move will also keep me away from the enemy snake, which is currently located in the bottom left corner of the board.\n\nNext turn, I will reevaluate the situation and decide whether to continue moving right towards the apple at (8, 5), or if it would be better to move down towards the apple at (6, 2) or the one at (3, 5). My strategy will be to prioritize collecting apples while avoiding collisions with walls or the enemy snake.\n\nMy next move: RIGHT."
