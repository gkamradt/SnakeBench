My goal is to collect as many apples as possible and avoid running into other snakes or the walls.\n\nSince I'm currently at the right edge of the board, I have limited options for movement. I can move left to (5, 8), right to (7, 8), up to (6, 7), or down to (7, 8). However, moving down would put me in the path of Snake #2, which is at (7, 4). Therefore, I'll move up to (6, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to move towards the apple at (1, 2) and see if I can collect it.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
