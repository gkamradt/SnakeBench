The snake should also be cautious of the enemy snake at (5, 0), but there is a safe path to the apple at (1, 5) without immediate risk of collision.\n\nThe snake is currently at (7, 9), and moving up would bring it closer to the apple at (1, 5). Moving up is the most direct path towards the apple and avoids the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving up, I will continue to move towards the apple at (1, 5) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements and ensuring I do not get cornered. I will also consider the possibility of moving left to avoid any potential threats from the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: UP"
