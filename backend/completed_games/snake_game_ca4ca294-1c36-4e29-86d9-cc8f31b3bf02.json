The next closest apple is at (5, 1), which is directly below my current position. Since there are no immediate threats from the enemy snake or the walls, the best strategy is to continue moving towards the apple at (5, 1).\n\nHowever, I must be careful not to overshoot the apple when moving down. Since the board is a grid and the snake occupies discrete spaces, I need to plan my moves so that I arrive at the apple's position without skipping over it. From (5, 8), I need to move down three times to reach (5, 5), and then I can move right once to (5, 4) before moving down the remaining three times to reach the apple at (5, 1).\n\nThis path will allow me to avoid any sharp turns and keep my movements predictable and controlled, reducing the risk of self-collision. It also keeps me moving away from the enemy snake's current position at (4, 2).\n\nSo, my next move is to start this sequence by moving DOWN.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving down to (5, 7), I will continue moving down towards the apple at (5, 1), making sure to adjust my trajectory at (5, 5) to move right once before continuing down to the apple. I will also reassess the positions of the enemy snake and any new apples that may have appeared.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
