However, it doesn't proactively move toward any apples and endangers potential future movements to avoid the enemy snake.\n   \n2. **DOWN (to (2, 6))**:\n   - This is not a viable move as I'll run into the enemy snake at (2, 6).\n   \n3. **LEFT (to (1, 7))**:\n   - Moving to (1, 7) is safe and puts me one step closer to the apple at (1, 8).\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 7))**: \n   - This would move me back to my previous position (2, 7), which is not a forward move and is against the rules as it collides with myself.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- Moving DOWN is not an option due to the enemy snake.\n- UP and RIGHT either do not advance my position toward an apple or lead back to the same place.\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 7) positions me closer to the apple at (1, 8) and maintains the option to move up next turn to collect the apple if the enemy doesn't block my way.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current evaluation, the best move for my snake is to move LEFT to (1, 7).
