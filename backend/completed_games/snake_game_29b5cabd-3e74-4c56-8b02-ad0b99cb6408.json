Row 4, column 7 is empty, and moving downward reduces the vertical gap to our target apple.\n\n\u2022 LEFT would take us to (6,5), which is safe, but it would move us off the current column. Since the apple\u2019s x-coordinate is 7, that would mean an extra lateral correction later.\n\n\u2022 RIGHT would go to (8,5), where again there\u2019s an obstacle (\u201cT\u201d) present.\n\nThus, the best move to continue our path toward the apple at (7,3) is to go DOWN, keeping our x-coordinate aligned and steadily closing the gap.\n\nA strategy for the subsequent turn will be to continue moving downward until we\u2019re aligned with the apple in the y-direction and then grab it, all while staying mindful of the obstacles on the board.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

According to the game rules, moving onto an apple is beneficial since our snake grows and scores a point, and (7,3) is within the board bounds and free of obstacles.\n\nTherefore, by moving DOWN we secure the apple and gain the point. A strategy for subsequent moves after collecting the apple would be to assess other apple locations (like (2, 6) or (4, 1)) while planning a safe trajectory around obstacles.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

By contrast, the apple at (8,7) (top\u2010right) is only 1 to the right but 4 up, and a direct upward route would eventually force us near obstacles (notice row 5 at column 8 is occupied by enemy \u201cT\u201d) so planning a safe passage there is tricky.\n\nLooking around our head at (7,3), the possible moves are:\n\u2022 UP to (7,4): That cell has a \u201cT\u201d (see row 4, col 7), so it\u2019s unsafe.\n\u2022 RIGHT to (8,3): It\u2019s free but moves us away from our target.\n\u2022 LEFT to (6,3): Safe and moves us left, reducing the x-difference.\n\u2022 DOWN to (7,2): Safe and reduces our y-value toward the target apple\u2019s row.\n\nEither LEFT or DOWN would work in a multi-step path toward (4,1). I\u2019m choosing to move in the down direction since it directly reduces the y gap (from 3 to 1) and sets up a route where we can later move left without risking inadvertent encounters with the enemy snake\u2019s body.\n\nMy plan is:\n1. Move DOWN to (7,2).\n2. Then plan further moves (like LEFT, LEFT, etc.) to approach (4,1) gradually while keeping clear of enemy obstacles.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: DOWN."

It's unlikely that it will reach the top of the board in the next few turns, but I should still be cautious.\n\nConsidering my current position, I think it's safer to move up to get the apple at (6, 9). This will give me another point and allow me to grow further. Additionally, moving up will also give me more space to maneuver and avoid the enemy snake.\n\nNext turn, I'll remind myself to check if the enemy snake has moved and if it's getting closer to my path, and also consider the possibility of moving towards other apples.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
