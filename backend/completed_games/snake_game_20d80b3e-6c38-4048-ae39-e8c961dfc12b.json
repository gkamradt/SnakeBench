Since there are no obstacles in my way, I should move left again to get even closer to the apple at (1, 9).\n\nAs I move left, I should keep an eye on the enemy snake at (1, 1) with body at [(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)] to make sure it doesn't get in my way. But for now, it seems to be far enough away that I don't need to worry about it.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns will be to keep moving left until I reach the apple at (1, 9). After that, I should reassess the situation and decide which apple to target next.\n\nSince the apple at (9, 9) is also on the same y-coordinate as me, I might consider targeting that apple next, but I would have to go around my current body to get to it, so it might not be the best target.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully reach the apple at (1, 9), I should consider moving down to target the apple at (3, 1).\n\nNext move: LEFT."

The closest apple to me appears to be at (1, 9), which is 8 units up from my current position. Another apple is at (3, 1), which is 2 units to the right from my current position. There's also an apple at (9, 9) and (9, 2), but they seem farther away.\n\nSince my last move was LEFT, I should consider moving towards the closest apple. Moving up would put me in a good position to collect the apple at (1, 9), but it's quite far away. Moving right would put me in a good position to collect the apple at (3, 1), which is closer.\n\nI should also be aware of the enemy snake's position at (6, 9) and try to avoid it. The enemy snake is currently at the top right of the board, so moving up might put me in its path.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns will be to continue moving towards the closest apple and then reassess the board state to determine my next move. After collecting an apple, I can consider moving towards other apples while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls.\n\nFor this turn, I should move right to get the apple at (3, 1), as it's closer and safer than moving up towards the enemy snake.\n\nMy decided next move: RIGHT"
