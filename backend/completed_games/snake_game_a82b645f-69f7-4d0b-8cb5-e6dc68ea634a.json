            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,6). There are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), and (1,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (9,6), which is in row 6, column 9.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,5): row 5, column 3\n\n- (3,3): row 3, column 3\n\n- (3,8): row 8, column 3\n\n- (9,1): row 1, column 9\n\n- (1,4): row 4, column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,1), which is row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I presume that eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: A\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (9,1), the only thing in the way is the apple at (9,1).\n\nBut wait, there's also the enemy snake at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might move and block my path.\n\nBut since I'm moving down to (9,1), and the enemy is at (2,1), which is in the same row but different column, I need to see if the enemy snake can grow to reach my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is only the head at (2,1) and has no body parts, and assuming it moves to eat the apple at (1,4), which is adjacent, it might grow to include (2,1) and (1,4).\n\nBut I'm moving to (9,1), which is in the same row as the enemy's head.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy can cut off my path.\n\nWait, no, the enemy is at (2,1), and I'm at (9,6). The enemy would have to move towards me to interfere, but it's probably going for the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move down to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), eating the apple at (9,1).\n\nEach move down:\n\n1. From (9,6) to (9,5): safe, no obstacles.\n\n2. From (9,5) to (9,4): safe.\n\n3. From (9,4) to (9,3): safe.\n\n4. From (9,3) to (9,2): safe.\n\n5. From (9,2) to (9,1): apple is there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in the process, I don't bump into myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your length increases, so your tail stays where it was before you moved to the new head position.\n\nBut in this game, I need to confirm how growth works.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, I can continue moving without overlapping my own body, as the eaten apple makes me longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to move in such a way that my head collides with my own body.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,1) should be safe, as there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, after eating (9,1), the next closest apple might be (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nEnemy is at (2,1), and might move to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, diagonally if allowed, but in standard snake games, movement is orthogonal.\n\nAssuming orthogonal movement, the enemy would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nThat would take 4 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1), eat the apple, and then decide my next move.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I need to consider where to go next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,8).\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving left towards the cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nBut first, I need to get to X=3.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4"

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: A\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (9,1), the only thing in the way is the apple at (9,1).\n\nBut there's also the enemy snake at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might move and block my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (2,1) and probably going for the apple at (1,4), which is adjacent, it might grow to include (2,1) and (1,4).\n\nBut I'm moving to (9,1), which is in the same row but a different column.\n\nI need to see if the enemy can reach column 9 before I do or block my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy moves to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). That's a few moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1) in 5 moves.\n\nSo, it might be safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (9,1), the next closest apples are at (3,3), (3,5), or (3,8).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards X=3.\n\nOption 2: Move up towards Y=8.\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, moving left towards X=3 seems reasonable.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps to (3,1), then up to (3,5) to get the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4,3.\n\nFrom the board, columns 8,7,6,5,4,3 don't have any snakes or apples in row 1.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,1) should be safe.\n\nThen, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nLet me check the path from (3,1) to (3,5):\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,5), I need to move up 4 rows.\n\nChecking row 1 to row 5 in column 3:\n\nRow 1: A (apple)\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 3: A (apple)\n\nRow 4: A (apple)\n\nRow 5: A (apple)\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,1), but I'm planning to move to (3,1) after eating (9,1).\n\nActually, the apple at (3,1) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's just the apple at (9,1) that's there.\n\nWait, the apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), (1,4).\n\nSo, in row 1, column 9: apple at (9,1).\n\nIn row 1, column 2: enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nWait, the board shows an apple at (9,1) and an enemy at (2,1).\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: no apple.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, in row 1:\n\nColumn 0: .\n\nColumn 1: .\n\nColumn 2: 1 (enemy)\n\nColumn 9: A (apple)\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: .\n\nTherefore, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider that there's an apple at (3,5), (3,"

There are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), and (1,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . .

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I presume that eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4.

Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . .

The enemy would have to move towards me to interfere, but it's probably going for the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move down to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), eating the apple at (9,1).\n\nEach move down:\n\n1. From (9,6) to (9,5): safe, no obstacles.\n\n2. From (9,5) to (9,4): safe.\n\n3. From (9,4) to (9,3): safe.\n\n4. From (9,3) to (9,2): safe.\n\n5.

A . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,5), I need to move up 4 rows.\n\nChecking row 1 to row 5 in column 3:\n\nRow 1: A (apple)\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 3: A (apple)\n\nRow 4: A (apple)\n\nRow 5: A (apple)\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,1), but I'm planning to move to (3,1) after eating (9,1).\n\nActually, the apple at (3,1) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's just the apple at (9,1) that's there.\n\nWait, the apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), (1,4).\n\nSo, in row 1, column 9: apple at (9,1).\n\nIn row 1, column 2: enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nWait, the board shows an apple at (9,1) and an enemy at (2,1).\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: no apple.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, in row 1:\n\nColumn 0: .\n\nColumn 1: .\n\nColumn 2: 1 (enemy)\n\nColumn 9: A (apple)\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: .\n\nTherefore, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider that there's an apple at (3,5), (3,"

There's also an enemy snake at (1,2).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the coordinate system. The bottom-left corner is (0,0), and the top-right is (9,9). So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (8,7), which is on the lower part of the grid, towards the right.\n\nI need to plan my moves to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRows from 0 to 9, columns from 0 to 9.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,8)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nEnemy snake is at (1,2).\n\nMy snake is at (8,7).\n\nI need to consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to collect them efficiently, avoiding the enemy and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's list the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 5 = 2\n\n- Total: 7\n\n2. (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 3 = 4\n\n- Total: 9\n\n3. (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n- Delta Y: 8 - 7 = 1\n\n- Total: 6\n\n4. (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 8 - 9 = 1\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 1 = 6\n\n- Total: 7\n\n5. (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 8 - 1 = 7\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 4 = 3\n\n- Total: 10\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,8) and (9,1), both with a distance of 6 and 7 respectively.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet me consider moving towards (3,8) first.\n\nTo get from (8,7) to (3,8):\n\n- Move left 5 times to go from X=8 to X=3.\n\n- Then move up 1 time to go from Y=7 to Y=8.\n\nSo, path would be:\n\n(8,7) -> (7,7) -> (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,8)\n\nI need to ensure that during this path, I don't run into the enemy or any part of myself.\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (9,1):\n\n- Move right 1 to (9,7)\n\n- Then down 6 to (9,1)\n\nBut wait, I'm already at X=8, and (9,1) is at X=9, which is to the right.\n\nWait, I'm at (8,7), and (9,1) is down and to the right.\n\nWait, no: X increases to the right, Y increases upwards.\n\nSo, to go from (8,7) to (9,1):\n\n- Increase X by 1 (right)\n\n- Decrease Y by 6 (down)\n\nSo, path would be:\n\n(8,7) -> (9,7) -> (9,6) -> (9,5) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2) -> (9,1)\n\nBut I need to check if this path is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4). The enemy is at (1,2).\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf I move towards (3,8), I'm moving left and up, away from the enemy, which is at (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (9,1) is down and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which path is safer.\n\nAlso, consider that when I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to run into my own body.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake have a body? Or is it just the head moving?\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it seems that the snake has a body, as eating an apple makes it grow longer.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is as I move.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked, with '2' at (8,7).\n\nSimilarly, snake 1 is at (1,2).\n\nI need to assume that the snakes have bodies that extend beyond just the head, but since the body positions aren't specified, I'll have to assume that their bodies don't obstruct my path unless specified.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan paths that avoid the enemy's head and any potential body parts.\n\nGiven that, I think moving towards (3,8) is a better option because it takes me away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nAfter getting (3,8), I can potentially pick up (3,5) and (3,3) more easily.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,1) is closer but then I'd have to move back up to get to other apples, which might be less efficient.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy is at (1,2), moving towards (3,8) puts me in a position where the enemy would have to come up to me, which I can try to avoid.\n\nSo, I think the best strategy is to move towards (3,8).\n\nFirst, I need to move left to decrease my X coordinate to 3, then move up to Y=8.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (8,7), moving left:\n\n(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nThen up to (3,8)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by the enemy or have apples that might be moving.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,2), which is not in my path.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n\nNone of these are in my path except for (3,8), which is my target.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter reaching (3,8), I can then plan to move down to (3,5), then to (3,3), and so on.\n\nAlso, after eating an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own body.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move left.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to control a snake in a multi-apple snake game on a 10x10 grid, collecting apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and itself. The goal is to maximize points by collecting apples.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Board and Positions:**\n   - The board uses coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right.\n   - Our snake is at (8,7), and apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n   - There is an enemy snake at (1,2).\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apples.\n   - The closest apples are at (3,8) and (9,1), both with a distance of 6 and 7 respectively from our current position.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Moving towards (3,8) involves moving left to x=3 and then up to y=8.\n   - This path takes us away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples, making it efficient.\n\n4. **Ensure Path Safety:**\n   - Check that the path to (3,8) does not intersect with the enemy or any part of our own body.\n   - Since only heads are marked and body positions are not specified, assume paths are clear unless obstructed.\n\n5. **Execute the Move:**\n   - The immediate move should be to the left to start moving towards (3,8).\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a turn-based game and the response is directional, the solution is straightforward:\n\n```plaintext\nLEFT\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Current Position:** (8,7)\n- **Target Apple:** (3,8)\n- **Path:** Move left to x=3, then up to y=8.\n- **Immediate Move:** LEFT\n\nBy moving left, we begin the journey towards the closest cluster of apples while avoiding the enemy. This strategy ensures we are moving towards high-reward positions efficiently and safely."

There are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), and (1,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . .

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I presume that eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . .

The enemy would have to move towards me to interfere, but it's probably going for the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move down to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), eating the apple at (9,1).\n\nEach move down:\n\n1. From (9,6) to (9,5): safe, no obstacles.\n\n2. From (9,5) to (9,4): safe.\n\n3. From (9,4) to (9,3): safe.\n\n4. From (9,3) to (9,2): safe.\n\n5. From (9,2) to (9,1): apple is there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in the process, I don't bump into myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your length increases, so your tail stays where it was before you moved to the new head position.\n\nBut in this game, I need to confirm how growth works.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, I can continue moving without overlapping my own body, as the eaten apple makes me longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to move in such a way that my head collides with my own body.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,1) should be safe, as there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, after eating (9,1), the next closest apple might be (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nEnemy is at (2,1), and might move to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, diagonally if allowed, but in standard snake games, movement is orthogonal.\n\nAssuming orthogonal movement, the enemy would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nThat would take 4 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1), eat the apple, and then decide my next move.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I need to consider where to go next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,8).\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving left towards the cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nBut first, I need to get to X=3.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4"

Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: A\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (9,1), the only thing in the way is the apple at (9,1).\n\nBut there's also the enemy snake at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might move and block my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (2,1) and probably going for the apple at (1,4), which is adjacent, it might grow to include (2,1) and (1,4).\n\nBut I'm moving to (9,1), which is in the same row but a different column.\n\nI need to see if the enemy can reach column 9 before I do or block my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy moves to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). That's a few moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1) in 5 moves.\n\nSo, it might be safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (9,1), the next closest apples are at (3,3), (3,5), or (3,8).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards X=3.\n\nOption 2: Move up towards Y=8.\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, moving left towards X=3 seems reasonable.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps to (3,1), then up to (3,5) to get the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4,3.\n\nFrom the board, columns 8,7,6,5,4,3 don't have any snakes or apples in row 1.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,1) should be safe.\n\nThen, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nLet me check the path from (3,1) to (3,5):\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,5), I need to move up 4 rows.\n\nChecking row 1 to row 5 in column 3:\n\nRow 1: A (apple)\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 3: A (apple)\n\nRow 4: A (apple)\n\nRow 5: A (apple)\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,1), but I'm planning to move to (3,1) after eating (9,1).\n\nActually, the apple at (3,1) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's just the apple at (9,1) that's there.\n\nWait, the apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), (1,4).\n\nSo, in row 1, column 9: apple at (9,1).\n\nIn row 1, column 2: enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nWait, the board shows an apple at (9,1) and an enemy at (2,1).\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: no apple.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, in row 1:\n\nColumn 0: .\n\nColumn 1: .\n\nColumn 2: 1 (enemy)\n\nColumn 9: A (apple)\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: .\n\nTherefore, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider that there's an apple at (3,5), (3,"

There's also an enemy snake at (1,2).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the coordinate system. The bottom-left corner is (0,0), and the top-right is (9,9).

The enemy is at (1,2).\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf I move towards (3,8), I'm moving left and up, away from the enemy, which is at (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (9,1) is down and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which path is safer.\n\nAlso, consider that when I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to run into my own body.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake have a body? Or is it just the head moving?\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it seems that the snake has a body, as eating an apple makes it grow longer.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is as I move.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked, with '2' at (8,7).\n\nSimilarly, snake 1 is at (1,2).\n\nI need to assume that the snakes have bodies that extend beyond just the head, but since the body positions aren't specified, I'll have to assume that their bodies don't obstruct my path unless specified.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan paths that avoid the enemy's head and any potential body parts.\n\nGiven that, I think moving towards (3,8) is a better option because it takes me away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nAfter getting (3,8), I can potentially pick up (3,5) and (3,3) more easily.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,1) is closer but then I'd have to move back up to get to other apples, which might be less efficient.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy is at (1,2), moving towards (3,8) puts me in a position where the enemy would have to come up to me, which I can try to avoid.\n\nSo, I think the best strategy is to move towards (3,8).\n\nFirst, I need to move left to decrease my X coordinate to 3, then move up to Y=8.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (8,7), moving left:\n\n(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nThen up to (3,8)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by the enemy or have apples that might be moving.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,2), which is not in my path.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n\nNone of these are in my path except for (3,8), which is my target.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter reaching (3,8), I can then plan to move down to (3,5), then to (3,3), and so on.\n\nAlso, after eating an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own body.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move left.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to control a snake in a multi-apple snake game on a 10x10 grid, collecting apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and itself.

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I presume that eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . .

The enemy would have to move towards me to interfere, but it's probably going for the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move down to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), eating the apple at (9,1).\n\nEach move down:\n\n1. From (9,6) to (9,5): safe, no obstacles.\n\n2. From (9,5) to (9,4): safe.\n\n3. From (9,4) to (9,3): safe.\n\n4. From (9,3) to (9,2): safe.\n\n5. From (9,2) to (9,1): apple is there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in the process, I don't bump into myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your length increases, so your tail stays where it was before you moved to the new head position.\n\nBut in this game, I need to confirm how growth works.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, I can continue moving without overlapping my own body, as the eaten apple makes me longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to move in such a way that my head collides with my own body.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,1) should be safe, as there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, after eating (9,1), the next closest apple might be (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nEnemy is at (2,1), and might move to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, diagonally if allowed, but in standard snake games, movement is orthogonal.\n\nAssuming orthogonal movement, the enemy would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nThat would take 4 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1), eat the apple, and then decide my next move.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I need to consider where to go next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,8).\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving left towards the cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nBut first, I need to get to X=3.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4"

Or is it just the head moving?\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it seems that the snake has a body, as eating an apple makes it grow longer.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is as I move.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked, with '2' at (8,7).\n\nSimilarly, snake 1 is at (1,2).\n\nI need to assume that the snakes have bodies that extend beyond just the head, but since the body positions aren't specified, I'll have to assume that their bodies don't obstruct my path unless specified.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan paths that avoid the enemy's head and any potential body parts.\n\nGiven that, I think moving towards (3,8) is a better option because it takes me away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nAfter getting (3,8), I can potentially pick up (3,5) and (3,3) more easily.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,1) is closer but then I'd have to move back up to get to other apples, which might be less efficient.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy is at (1,2), moving towards (3,8) puts me in a position where the enemy would have to come up to me, which I can try to avoid.\n\nSo, I think the best strategy is to move towards (3,8).\n\nFirst, I need to move left to decrease my X coordinate to 3, then move up to Y=8.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (8,7), moving left:\n\n(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nThen up to (3,8)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by the enemy or have apples that might be moving.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,2), which is not in my path.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n\nNone of these are in my path except for (3,8), which is my target.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter reaching (3,8), I can then plan to move down to (3,5), then to (3,3), and so on.\n\nAlso, after eating an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own body.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move left.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to control a snake in a multi-apple snake game on a 10x10 grid, collecting apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and itself. The goal is to maximize points by collecting apples.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Board and Positions:**\n   - The board uses coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right.\n   - Our snake is at (8,7), and apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n   - There is an enemy snake at (1,2).\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apples.\n   - The closest apples are at (3,8) and (9,1), both with a distance of 6 and 7 respectively from our current position.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Moving towards (3,8) involves moving left to x=3 and then up to y=8.\n   - This path takes us away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples, making it efficient.\n\n4. **Ensure Path Safety:**\n   - Check that the path to (3,8) does not intersect with the enemy or any part of our own body.\n   - Since only heads are marked and body positions are not specified, assume paths are clear unless obstructed.\n\n5. **Execute the Move:**\n   - The immediate move should be to the left to start moving towards (3,8).\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a turn-based game and the response is directional, the solution is straightforward:\n\n```plaintext\nLEFT\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Current Position:** (8,7)\n- **Target Apple:** (3,8)\n- **Path:** Move left to x=3, then up to y=8.\n- **Immediate Move:** LEFT\n\nBy moving left, we begin the journey towards the closest cluster of apples while avoiding the enemy. This strategy ensures we are moving towards high-reward positions efficiently and safely."

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRows from 0 to 9, columns from 0 to 9.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,8)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nEnemy snake is at (1,3).\n\nMy snake is at (7,7).\n\nI need to consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to collect them efficiently, avoiding the enemy and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's list the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 5 = 2\n\n- Total: 6\n\n2. (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 3 = 4\n\n- Total: 8\n\n3. (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4\n\n- Delta Y: 8 - 7 = 1\n\n- Total: 5\n\n4. (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 9 = 2\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 1 = 6\n\n- Total: 8\n\n5. (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 1 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 7 - 4 = 3\n\n- Total: 9\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,8) with a distance of 5, followed by (3,5) at 6, and (9,1) at 8.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet me consider moving towards (3,8) first.\n\nTo get from (7,7) to (3,8):\n\n- Move left 4 times to go from X=7 to X=3.\n\n- Then move up 1 time to go from Y=7 to Y=8.\n\nSo, path would be:\n\n(7,7) -> (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,8)\n\nI need to ensure that during this path, I don't run into the enemy or any part of myself.\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (9,1):\n\n- Move right 2 to go from X=7 to X=9\n\n- Then down 6 to go from Y=7 to Y=1\n\nBut that seems longer and brings me closer to the bottom edge, where there's an apple at (9,1), but I need to consider if it's safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (1,3). If I move towards (3,8), I'm moving left and up, away from the enemy.\n\nMoving towards (3,8) seems safer.\n\nAlso, after picking up (3,8), I can potentially go to (3,5) and then to (3,3), as they are aligned in the same column.\n\nSo, my strategy should be:\n\n1. Move to (3,8)\n\n2. Then to (3,5)\n\n3. Then to (3,3)\n\n4. Then decide on the next apple\n\nNow, let's think about the immediate move.\n\nFrom (7,7), I need to move left to reach X=3.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the left.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no immediate obstacles in that path.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (1,3), which is not in my path.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter moving to (6,7), then (5,7), then (4,7), then (3,7), and finally up to (3,8).\n\nEach time, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to control a snake in a multi-apple snake game on a 10x10 grid, collecting apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and itself. The goal is to maximize points by collecting apples.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Board and Positions:**\n   - The board uses coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right.\n   - Our snake is at (7,7), and apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n   - There is an enemy snake at (1,3).\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apples.\n   - The closest apples are at (3,8) with a distance of 5, followed by (3,5) at 6, and (9,1) at 8.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Moving towards (3,8) involves moving left to x=3 and then up to y=8.\n   - This path takes us away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples, making it efficient.\n\n4. **Ensure Path Safety:**\n   - Check that the path to (3,8) does not intersect with the enemy or any part of our own body.\n   - Since only heads are marked and body positions are not specified, assume paths are clear unless obstructed.\n\n5. **Execute the Move:**\n   - The immediate move should be to the left to start moving towards (3,8).\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a turn-based game and the response is directional, the solution is straightforward:\n\n```plaintext\nLEFT\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Current Position:** (7,7)\n- **Target Apple:** (3,8)\n- **Path:** Move left to x=3, then up to y=8.\n- **Immediate Move:** LEFT\n\nBy moving left, we begin the journey towards the closest cluster of apples while avoiding the enemy. This strategy ensures we are moving towards high-reward positions efficiently and safely."

There are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), and (1,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . .

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I presume that eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: A\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (9,1), the only thing in the way is the apple at (9,1).\n\nBut wait, there's also the enemy snake at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might move and block my path.\n\nBut since I'm moving down to (9,1), and the enemy is at (2,1), which is in the same row but different column, I need to see if the enemy snake can grow to reach my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is only the head at (2,1) and has no body parts, and assuming it moves to eat the apple at (1,4), which is adjacent, it might grow to include (2,1) and (1,4).\n\nBut I'm moving to (9,1), which is in the same row as the enemy's head.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy can cut off my path.\n\nWait, no, the enemy is at (2,1), and I'm at (9,6). The enemy would have to move towards me to interfere, but it's probably going for the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move down to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), eating the apple at (9,1).\n\nEach move down:\n\n1. From (9,6) to (9,5): safe, no obstacles.\n\n2. From (9,5) to (9,4): safe.\n\n3. From (9,4) to (9,3): safe.\n\n4. From (9,3) to (9,2): safe.\n\n5. From (9,2) to (9,1): apple is there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in the process, I don't bump into myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your length increases, so your tail stays where it was before you moved to the new head position.\n\nBut in this game, I need to confirm how growth works.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, I can continue moving without overlapping my own body, as the eaten apple makes me longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to move in such a way that my head collides with my own body.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,1) should be safe, as there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, after eating (9,1), the next closest apple might be (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nEnemy is at (2,1), and might move to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, diagonally if allowed, but in standard snake games, movement is orthogonal.\n\nAssuming orthogonal movement, the enemy would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nThat would take 4 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1), eat the apple, and then decide my next move.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I need to consider where to go next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,8).\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving left towards the cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nBut first, I need to get to X=3.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4"

Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: A\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (9,1), the only thing in the way is the apple at (9,1).\n\nBut there's also the enemy snake at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might move and block my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (2,1) and probably going for the apple at (1,4), which is adjacent, it might grow to include (2,1) and (1,4).\n\nBut I'm moving to (9,1), which is in the same row but a different column.\n\nI need to see if the enemy can reach column 9 before I do or block my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy moves to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). That's a few moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1) in 5 moves.\n\nSo, it might be safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (9,1), the next closest apples are at (3,3), (3,5), or (3,8).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards X=3.\n\nOption 2: Move up towards Y=8.\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, moving left towards X=3 seems reasonable.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps to (3,1), then up to (3,5) to get the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4,3.\n\nFrom the board, columns 8,7,6,5,4,3 don't have any snakes or apples in row 1.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,1) should be safe.\n\nThen, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nLet me check the path from (3,1) to (3,5):\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,5), I need to move up 4 rows.\n\nChecking row 1 to row 5 in column 3:\n\nRow 1: A (apple)\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 3: A (apple)\n\nRow 4: A (apple)\n\nRow 5: A (apple)\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,1), but I'm planning to move to (3,1) after eating (9,1).\n\nActually, the apple at (3,1) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's just the apple at (9,1) that's there.\n\nWait, the apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), (1,4).\n\nSo, in row 1, column 9: apple at (9,1).\n\nIn row 1, column 2: enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nWait, the board shows an apple at (9,1) and an enemy at (2,1).\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: no apple.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, in row 1:\n\nColumn 0: .\n\nColumn 1: .\n\nColumn 2: 1 (enemy)\n\nColumn 9: A (apple)\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: .\n\nTherefore, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider that there's an apple at (3,5), (3,"

Or is it just the head moving?\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it seems that the snake has a body, as eating an apple makes it grow longer.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is as I move.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked, with '2' at (8,7).\n\nSimilarly, snake 1 is at (1,2).\n\nI need to assume that the snakes have bodies that extend beyond just the head, but since the body positions aren't specified, I'll have to assume that their bodies don't obstruct my path unless specified.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan paths that avoid the enemy's head and any potential body parts.\n\nGiven that, I think moving towards (3,8) is a better option because it takes me away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nAfter getting (3,8), I can potentially pick up (3,5) and (3,3) more easily.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,1) is closer but then I'd have to move back up to get to other apples, which might be less efficient.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy is at (1,2), moving towards (3,8) puts me in a position where the enemy would have to come up to me, which I can try to avoid.\n\nSo, I think the best strategy is to move towards (3,8).\n\nFirst, I need to move left to decrease my X coordinate to 3, then move up to Y=8.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (8,7), moving left:\n\n(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nThen up to (3,8)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by the enemy or have apples that might be moving.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,2), which is not in my path.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n\nNone of these are in my path except for (3,8), which is my target.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter reaching (3,8), I can then plan to move down to (3,5), then to (3,3), and so on.\n\nAlso, after eating an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own body.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move left.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to control a snake in a multi-apple snake game on a 10x10 grid, collecting apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and itself.

There are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), and (1,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . .

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I presume that eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . .

The enemy would have to move towards me to interfere, but it's probably going for the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move down to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), eating the apple at (9,1).\n\nEach move down:\n\n1. From (9,6) to (9,5): safe, no obstacles.\n\n2. From (9,5) to (9,4): safe.\n\n3. From (9,4) to (9,3): safe.\n\n4. From (9,3) to (9,2): safe.\n\n5. From (9,2) to (9,1): apple is there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in the process, I don't bump into myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your length increases, so your tail stays where it was before you moved to the new head position.\n\nBut in this game, I need to confirm how growth works.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, I can continue moving without overlapping my own body, as the eaten apple makes me longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to move in such a way that my head collides with my own body.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,1) should be safe, as there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, after eating (9,1), the next closest apple might be (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nEnemy is at (2,1), and might move to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, diagonally if allowed, but in standard snake games, movement is orthogonal.\n\nAssuming orthogonal movement, the enemy would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nThat would take 4 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1), eat the apple, and then decide my next move.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I need to consider where to go next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,8).\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving left towards the cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nBut first, I need to get to X=3.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4"

Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: A\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (9,1), the only thing in the way is the apple at (9,1).\n\nBut there's also the enemy snake at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might move and block my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (2,1) and probably going for the apple at (1,4), which is adjacent, it might grow to include (2,1) and (1,4).\n\nBut I'm moving to (9,1), which is in the same row but a different column.\n\nI need to see if the enemy can reach column 9 before I do or block my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy moves to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). That's a few moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1) in 5 moves.\n\nSo, it might be safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (9,1), the next closest apples are at (3,3), (3,5), or (3,8).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards X=3.\n\nOption 2: Move up towards Y=8.\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, moving left towards X=3 seems reasonable.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps to (3,1), then up to (3,5) to get the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4,3.\n\nFrom the board, columns 8,7,6,5,4,3 don't have any snakes or apples in row 1.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,1) should be safe.\n\nThen, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nLet me check the path from (3,1) to (3,5):\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,5), I need to move up 4 rows.\n\nChecking row 1 to row 5 in column 3:\n\nRow 1: A (apple)\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 3: A (apple)\n\nRow 4: A (apple)\n\nRow 5: A (apple)\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,1), but I'm planning to move to (3,1) after eating (9,1).\n\nActually, the apple at (3,1) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's just the apple at (9,1) that's there.\n\nWait, the apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), (1,4).\n\nSo, in row 1, column 9: apple at (9,1).\n\nIn row 1, column 2: enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nWait, the board shows an apple at (9,1) and an enemy at (2,1).\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: no apple.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, in row 1:\n\nColumn 0: .\n\nColumn 1: .\n\nColumn 2: 1 (enemy)\n\nColumn 9: A (apple)\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: .\n\nTherefore, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider that there's an apple at (3,5), (3,"

Or is it just the head moving?\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it seems that the snake has a body, as eating an apple makes it grow longer.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is as I move.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked, with '2' at (8,7).\n\nSimilarly, snake 1 is at (1,2).\n\nI need to assume that the snakes have bodies that extend beyond just the head, but since the body positions aren't specified, I'll have to assume that their bodies don't obstruct my path unless specified.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan paths that avoid the enemy's head and any potential body parts.\n\nGiven that, I think moving towards (3,8) is a better option because it takes me away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nAfter getting (3,8), I can potentially pick up (3,5) and (3,3) more easily.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,1) is closer but then I'd have to move back up to get to other apples, which might be less efficient.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy is at (1,2), moving towards (3,8) puts me in a position where the enemy would have to come up to me, which I can try to avoid.\n\nSo, I think the best strategy is to move towards (3,8).\n\nFirst, I need to move left to decrease my X coordinate to 3, then move up to Y=8.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (8,7), moving left:\n\n(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nThen up to (3,8)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by the enemy or have apples that might be moving.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,2), which is not in my path.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n\nNone of these are in my path except for (3,8), which is my target.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter reaching (3,8), I can then plan to move down to (3,5), then to (3,3), and so on.\n\nAlso, after eating an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own body.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move left.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to control a snake in a multi-apple snake game on a 10x10 grid, collecting apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and itself.

There are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), and (1,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . .

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I presume that eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . .

The enemy would have to move towards me to interfere, but it's probably going for the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move down to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), eating the apple at (9,1).\n\nEach move down:\n\n1. From (9,6) to (9,5): safe, no obstacles.\n\n2. From (9,5) to (9,4): safe.\n\n3. From (9,4) to (9,3): safe.\n\n4. From (9,3) to (9,2): safe.\n\n5. From (9,2) to (9,1): apple is there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in the process, I don't bump into myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your length increases, so your tail stays where it was before you moved to the new head position.\n\nBut in this game, I need to confirm how growth works.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, I can continue moving without overlapping my own body, as the eaten apple makes me longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to move in such a way that my head collides with my own body.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,1) should be safe, as there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, after eating (9,1), the next closest apple might be (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nEnemy is at (2,1), and might move to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, diagonally if allowed, but in standard snake games, movement is orthogonal.\n\nAssuming orthogonal movement, the enemy would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nThat would take 4 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1), eat the apple, and then decide my next move.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I need to consider where to go next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,8).\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving left towards the cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nBut first, I need to get to X=3.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4"

The coordinates go from (0,0) in the bottom left to (9,9) in the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . .

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1.

Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . .

Or is it just the head moving?\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it seems that the snake has a body, as eating an apple makes it grow longer.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is as I move.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked, with '2' at (8,7).\n\nSimilarly, snake 1 is at (1,2).\n\nI need to assume that the snakes have bodies that extend beyond just the head, but since the body positions aren't specified, I'll have to assume that their bodies don't obstruct my path unless specified.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan paths that avoid the enemy's head and any potential body parts.\n\nGiven that, I think moving towards (3,8) is a better option because it takes me away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nAfter getting (3,8), I can potentially pick up (3,5) and (3,3) more easily.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,1) is closer but then I'd have to move back up to get to other apples, which might be less efficient.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy is at (1,2), moving towards (3,8) puts me in a position where the enemy would have to come up to me, which I can try to avoid.\n\nSo, I think the best strategy is to move towards (3,8).\n\nFirst, I need to move left to decrease my X coordinate to 3, then move up to Y=8.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (8,7), moving left:\n\n(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nThen up to (3,8)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by the enemy or have apples that might be moving.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,2), which is not in my path.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n\nNone of these are in my path except for (3,8), which is my target.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter reaching (3,8), I can then plan to move down to (3,5), then to (3,3), and so on.\n\nAlso, after eating an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own body.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move left.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to control a snake in a multi-apple snake game on a 10x10 grid, collecting apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and itself. The goal is to maximize points by collecting apples.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Board and Positions:**\n   - The board uses coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right.\n   - Our snake is at (8,7), and apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n   - There is an enemy snake at (1,2).\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apples.\n   - The closest apples are at (3,8) and (9,1), both with a distance of 6 and 7 respectively from our current position.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Moving towards (3,8) involves moving left to x=3 and then up to y=8.\n   - This path takes us away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples, making it efficient.\n\n4. **Ensure Path Safety:**\n   - Check that the path to (3,8) does not intersect with the enemy or any part of our own body.\n   - Since only heads are marked and body positions are not specified, assume paths are clear unless obstructed.\n\n5. **Execute the Move:**\n   - The immediate move should be to the left to start moving towards (3,8).\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a turn-based game and the response is directional, the solution is straightforward:\n\n```plaintext\nLEFT\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Current Position:** (8,7)\n- **Target Apple:** (3,8)\n- **Path:** Move left to x=3, then up to y=8.\n- **Immediate Move:** LEFT\n\nBy moving left, we begin the journey towards the closest cluster of apples while avoiding the enemy. This strategy ensures we are moving towards high-reward positions efficiently and safely."

The goal is to maximize points by collecting apples.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Board and Positions:**\n   - The board uses coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right.\n   - Our snake is at (4,7), and apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (4,3).\n   - There is an enemy snake at (3,4) with its body at (2,4).\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apples.\n   - The closest apples are at (3,8) with a distance of 2, followed by (3,5) at 3, and (4,3) at 4.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Move left to x=3, then up to y=8 to collect the closest apple.\n   - After collecting (3,8), proceed to (3,5), then (3,3), then (4,3), and finally (9,1).\n\n4. **Ensure Path Safety:**\n   - Check that the path to (3,8) does not intersect with the enemy or any part of our own body.\n   - Assume paths are clear unless obstructed by the enemy or grid boundaries.\n\n5. **Execute the Move:**\n   - The immediate move should be to the left to start moving towards (3,8).\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a turn-based game and the response is directional, the solution is straightforward:\n\n```plaintext\nLEFT\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Current Position:** (4,7)\n- **Target Apple:** (3,8)\n- **Path:** Move left to x=3, then up to y=8.\n- **Immediate Move:** LEFT\n\nBy moving left, we begin the journey towards the closest apple while avoiding the enemy. This strategy ensures we are moving towards high-reward positions efficiently and safely.\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is"

However, I also notice that Snake #2 is at position (3, 7), which is above the apple at (3, 5). This could be a potential threat.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (4, 3), which is one position to the right of us. This move would allow us to gain another point and grow our snake, while also keeping an eye on Snake #2.\n\nConsidering the current situation, I think it's best to move towards the apple at (4, 3). This move will allow us to gain another point and grow our snake, while also keeping a safe distance from Snake #2.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After getting the apple at (4, 3), reassess the situation and decide whether to move towards the apple at (3, 5) or explore other options.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this snake game. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is at (3,7), and I need to decide whether to go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (9,1), (3,8), (4,3), and (9,5). So, multiple targets here.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (3,3) with its body at (3,4) and (2,4). So, I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Looking at the distances:\n\n- From (3,7) to (3,8): just one step up.\n\n- To (3,5): down two steps.\n\n- To (9,1): that's way over there, too far.\n\n- To (4,3): down and to the right.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (3,8), just one step up. That seems like a good target.\n\nBut I should check if the way is clear.\n\nIf I go UP from (3,7) to (3,8), is that safe?\n\nWell, I need to make sure that (3,8) isn't occupied by the enemy or anything else.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position: (3,3) with body at (3,4) and (2,4). So, the enemy is below me, and its body is at (3,4) and (2,4).\n\nSo, (3,8) should be clear.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (3,8), my next moves are safe.\n\nAfter eating (3,8), I'll be at (3,8), and I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's see, from (3,8), the next closest apple is (3,5), which is down three steps.\n\nBut between (3,8) and (3,5), there's (3,7), which is where I am now, but after moving, my tail will move forward, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, actually, when I move to (3,8), my tail will move forward, so (3,7) will be free unless my tail is longer.\n\nBut right now, I'm just starting, so my tail is probably just one segment.\n\nWait, in snake games, usually, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment.\n\nSo, initially, my snake is just at (3,7), and if I move to (3,8) and eat the apple, my tail will stay at (3,7).\n\nThen, next move, if I go down to (3,7), my head is at (3,7), and my tail moves to (3,8), since I'm growing.\n\nWait, no. In snake games, the tail grows, so the tail stays where it was unless the snake moves forward.\n\nActually, it's a bit confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nLet's assume that after eating the apple at (3,8), my snake will be at (3,8), and my previous position (3,7) is still part of my body because I've grown.\n\nThen, if I move down to (3,7), my tail will move forward, but since I've grown, the tail will stay, so (3,7) is still part of my body.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nIn most snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your tail segment remains in its last position, and you don't lose length.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating (3,8), my snake will be at (3,8), and (3,7) will still be part of my body.\n\nTherefore, I can't immediately move back to (3,7) because it's part of my body, which would cause me to die.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path accordingly.\n\nTherefore, moving to (3,8) is safe, and then I can move down to (3,7), but then (3,7) is part of my body, so I can't go back.\n\nWait, no. After eating (3,8), my snake is at (3,8), and (3,7) is still part of my body.\n\nIf I move down to (3,7), that's okay because it's part of my body, but I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my head collides with my body.\n\nActually, in snake games, you can move onto your body as long as it's not instantaneous; the tail moves forward.\n\nBut in this turn-based scenario, I need to ensure that my head doesn't end up on any part of my body after the move.\n\nWait, but in reality, in snake games, moving forward onto a part of your body causes death.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating (3,8), if I move down to (3,7), which is part of my body, that would be a collision.\n\nTherefore, I need to plan my path so that I don't immediately double back onto my body.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (3,8), I should move to (3,9), if that's within bounds.\n\nWait, the board is from (0,0) to (9,9), so (3,9) is valid.\n\nBut there's no apple there, as far as I know.\n\nAlternatively, I can stay at (3,8) and look for another apple.\n\nBut I can't stay in the same place; I have to move each turn.\n\nWait, in this game, do I have to move each turn, or can I stay in place?\n\nThe rules say: if you move onto an apple, you grow and gain a point. If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nThey don't specify what happens if you don't move. Maybe you have to move each turn.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that you must move each turn.\n\nTherefore, after eating (3,8), I need to decide where to go next without colliding with myself.\n\nLet me think ahead.\n\nIf I go to (3,8), then I can go to (3,9), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, I can go to (4,8) or (2,8), but I need to see if there are apples in those directions.\n\nLooking at the board, (4,8) is empty, and (2,8) is also empty.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (3,8), I should move to (3,9), then to (3,10), but (3,10) is out of bounds, so that's a wall.\n\nWait, the board is from (0,0) to (9,9), so (3,10) is outside, which is a wall.\n\nSo, I can't go to (3,9) because that's the edge, and next move, I'd hit the wall.\n\nTherefore, after eating (3,8), moving to (3,9) would be risky because next turn, I'd hit the wall unless there's another apple at (3,9).\n\nBut there isn't, as per the given positions.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider moving to (4,8) or (2,8) after eating (3,8).\n\nLooking at (2,8): is that safe? Is there any enemy there?\n\nThe enemy is at (3,3) with body at (3,4) and (2,4). So, (2,8) should be clear.\n\nBut there's no apple there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,8) seems clear.\n\nBut again, no apple.\n\nSo, maybe I should consider moving to (3,5) next.\n\nTo get from (3,8) to (3,5), I need to move down three steps: to (3,7), then (3,6), then (3,5).\n\nBut, as I move down, I need to ensure that those positions are not occupied by my body or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (3,8), my body is at (3,8) and (3,7).\n\nThen, moving to (3,7): but (3,7) is part of my body, so that would cause a collision.\n\nWait, no. After eating (3,8), my tail is at (3,7), but when I move to (3,7), my tail moves forward to (3,6), assuming I've grown.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nIn snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating (3,8), my head is at (3,8), and my body is at (3,7).\n\nThen, if I move down to (3,7), my head moves to (3,7), and my tail moves to (3,8), since I've grown.\n\nBut (3,7) is already part of my body, so moving there would cause my head to be on my body, which should be fine because the tail is moving forward.\n\nWait, in many snake games, if your head moves to a position where your tail used to be, it's okay because the tail moves forward.\n\nBut in this case, since I"

There are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), and (1,4). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . .

The main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I presume that eating an apple makes it disappear, and I grow longer by that many cells. Each apple gives me one point.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to the nearest apple without putting myself in danger.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (9,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,5):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: A\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (9,1), the only thing in the way is the apple at (9,1).\n\nBut wait, there's also the enemy snake at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might move and block my path.\n\nBut since I'm moving down to (9,1), and the enemy is at (2,1), which is in the same row but different column, I need to see if the enemy snake can grow to reach my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is only the head at (2,1) and has no body parts, and assuming it moves to eat the apple at (1,4), which is adjacent, it might grow to include (2,1) and (1,4).\n\nBut I'm moving to (9,1), which is in the same row as the enemy's head.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy can cut off my path.\n\nWait, no, the enemy is at (2,1), and I'm at (9,6). The enemy would have to move towards me to interfere, but it's probably going for the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move down to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), eating the apple at (9,1).\n\nEach move down:\n\n1. From (9,6) to (9,5): safe, no obstacles.\n\n2. From (9,5) to (9,4): safe.\n\n3. From (9,4) to (9,3): safe.\n\n4. From (9,3) to (9,2): safe.\n\n5. From (9,2) to (9,1): apple is there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in the process, I don't bump into myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your length increases, so your tail stays where it was before you moved to the new head position.\n\nBut in this game, I need to confirm how growth works.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, I can continue moving without overlapping my own body, as the eaten apple makes me longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to move in such a way that my head collides with my own body.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (9,1) should be safe, as there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will have grown, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board again, after eating (9,1), the next closest apple might be (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's potential movements.\n\nEnemy is at (2,1), and might move to (1,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, diagonally if allowed, but in standard snake games, movement is orthogonal.\n\nAssuming orthogonal movement, the enemy would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nThat would take 4 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1), eat the apple, and then decide my next move.\n\nAfter eating (9,1), I need to consider where to go next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,8).\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving left towards the cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nBut first, I need to get to X=3.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4"

Apple at (3,3):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,1):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 1 = 5\n\n- Manhattan distance: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n4. Apple at (1,4):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 1 = 8\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (3,8):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 8 = 2\n\n- Manhattan distance: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,1), with a distance of 5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is safe. Let's see what's between me and that apple.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (9,1): that's straight down, decreasing Y by 5 steps.\n\nSo, moving down from (9,6) to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1).\n\nLet's check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 6: 2\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: A\n\nSo, from (9,6) to (9,1), the only thing in the way is the apple at (9,1).\n\nBut there's also the enemy snake at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might move and block my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (2,1) and probably going for the apple at (1,4), which is adjacent, it might grow to include (2,1) and (1,4).\n\nBut I'm moving to (9,1), which is in the same row but a different column.\n\nI need to see if the enemy can reach column 9 before I do or block my path.\n\nAssuming the enemy moves to (1,4), it would need to move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). That's a few moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can move down to (9,1) in 5 moves.\n\nSo, it might be safe to move down to (9,1).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,1), I will grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves to get to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (9,1), the next closest apples are at (3,3), (3,5), or (3,8).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next.\n\nOption 1: Move left towards X=3.\n\nOption 2: Move up towards Y=8.\n\nOption 3: Move to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is far away, and the enemy might be heading there.\n\nOption 4: Move to (3,3) or (3,5).\n\nGiven that, moving left towards X=3 seems reasonable.\n\nFrom (9,1), to get to X=3, I need to move left 6 steps to (3,1), then up to (3,5) to get the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (9,1) to (3,1):\n\nColumn 9: (9,1)\n\nColumn 8: (8,1)\n\n...\n\nColumn 3: (3,1)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in columns 8,7,6,5,4,3.\n\nFrom the board, columns 8,7,6,5,4,3 don't have any snakes or apples in row 1.\n\nSo, moving left to (3,1) should be safe.\n\nThen, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nLet me check the path from (3,1) to (3,5):\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (3,1) to (3,5), I need to move up 4 rows.\n\nChecking row 1 to row 5 in column 3:\n\nRow 1: A (apple)\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 3: A (apple)\n\nRow 4: A (apple)\n\nRow 5: A (apple)\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,1), but I'm planning to move to (3,1) after eating (9,1).\n\nActually, the apple at (3,1) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's just the apple at (9,1) that's there.\n\nWait, the apples are at (3,5), (3,3), (9,1), (3,8), (1,4).\n\nSo, in row 1, column 9: apple at (9,1).\n\nIn row 1, column 2: enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nWait, the board shows an apple at (9,1) and an enemy at (2,1).\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: no apple.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nRow 1: . . 1 . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, in row 1:\n\nColumn 0: .\n\nColumn 1: .\n\nColumn 2: 1 (enemy)\n\nColumn 9: A (apple)\n\nSo, in column 3, row 1: .\n\nTherefore, from (3,1), I can move up to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to consider that there's an apple at (3,5), (3,"

The enemy is at (1,2).\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf I move towards (3,8), I'm moving left and up, away from the enemy, which is at (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (9,1) is down and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which path is safer.\n\nAlso, consider that when I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me to run into my own body.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake have a body? Or is it just the head moving?\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it seems that the snake has a body, as eating an apple makes it grow longer.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is as I move.\n\nBut in the board state, only the head is marked, with '2' at (8,7).\n\nSimilarly, snake 1 is at (1,2).\n\nI need to assume that the snakes have bodies that extend beyond just the head, but since the body positions aren't specified, I'll have to assume that their bodies don't obstruct my path unless specified.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan paths that avoid the enemy's head and any potential body parts.\n\nGiven that, I think moving towards (3,8) is a better option because it takes me away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples at X=3.\n\nAfter getting (3,8), I can potentially pick up (3,5) and (3,3) more easily.\n\nAlternatively, going to (9,1) is closer but then I'd have to move back up to get to other apples, which might be less efficient.\n\nAlso, considering the enemy is at (1,2), moving towards (3,8) puts me in a position where the enemy would have to come up to me, which I can try to avoid.\n\nSo, I think the best strategy is to move towards (3,8).\n\nFirst, I need to move left to decrease my X coordinate to 3, then move up to Y=8.\n\nSo, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (8,7), moving left:\n\n(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nThen up to (3,8)\n\nI need to make sure that none of these positions are occupied by the enemy or have apples that might be moving.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,2), which is not in my path.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (3,3), (3,8), (9,1), and (1,4).\n\nNone of these are in my path except for (3,8), which is my target.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter reaching (3,8), I can then plan to move down to (3,5), then to (3,3), and so on.\n\nAlso, after eating an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own body.\n\nBut for now, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nSo, I'll decide to move left.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to control a snake in a multi-apple snake game on a 10x10 grid, collecting apples while avoiding walls, other snakes, and itself.

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is at (3,7), and I need to decide whether to go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (9,1), (3,8), (4,3), and (9,5). So, multiple targets here.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (3,3) with its body at (3,4) and (2,4). So, I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Looking at the distances:\n\n- From (3,7) to (3,8): just one step up.\n\n- To (3,5): down two steps.\n\n- To (9,1): that's way over there, too far.\n\n- To (4,3): down and to the right.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (3,8), just one step up. That seems like a good target.\n\nBut I should check if the way is clear.\n\nIf I go UP from (3,7) to (3,8), is that safe?\n\nWell, I need to make sure that (3,8) isn't occupied by the enemy or anything else.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position: (3,3) with body at (3,4) and (2,4). So, the enemy is below me, and its body is at (3,4) and (2,4).\n\nSo, (3,8) should be clear.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (3,8), my next moves are safe.\n\nAfter eating (3,8), I'll be at (3,8), and I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's see, from (3,8), the next closest apple is (3,5), which is down three steps.\n\nBut between (3,8) and (3,5), there's (3,7), which is where I am now, but after moving, my tail will move forward, so it should be clear.\n\nWait, actually, when I move to (3,8), my tail will move forward, so (3,7) will be free unless my tail is longer.\n\nBut right now, I'm just starting, so my tail is probably just one segment.\n\nWait, in snake games, usually, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment.\n\nSo, initially, my snake is just at (3,7), and if I move to (3,8) and eat the apple, my tail will stay at (3,7).\n\nThen, next move, if I go down to (3,7), my head is at (3,7), and my tail moves to (3,8), since I'm growing.\n\nWait, no. In snake games, the tail grows, so the tail stays where it was unless the snake moves forward.\n\nActually, it's a bit confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nLet's assume that after eating the apple at (3,8), my snake will be at (3,8), and my previous position (3,7) is still part of my body because I've grown.\n\nThen, if I move down to (3,7), my tail will move forward, but since I've grown, the tail will stay, so (3,7) is still part of my body.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nIn most snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your tail segment remains in its last position, and you don't lose length.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating (3,8), my snake will be at (3,8), and (3,7) will still be part of my body.\n\nTherefore, I can't immediately move back to (3,7) because it's part of my body, which would cause me to die.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path accordingly.\n\nTherefore, moving to (3,8) is safe, and then I can move down to (3,7), but then (3,7) is part of my body, so I can't go back.\n\nWait, no. After eating (3,8), my snake is at (3,8), and (3,7) is still part of my body.\n\nIf I move down to (3,7), that's okay because it's part of my body, but I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my head collides with my body.\n\nActually, in snake games, you can move onto your body as long as it's not instantaneous; the tail moves forward.\n\nBut in this turn-based scenario, I need to ensure that my head doesn't end up on any part of my body after the move.\n\nWait, but in reality, in snake games, moving forward onto a part of your body causes death.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating (3,8), if I move down to (3,7), which is part of my body, that would be a collision.\n\nTherefore, I need to plan my path so that I don't immediately double back onto my body.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (3,8), I should move to (3,9), if that's within bounds.\n\nWait, the board is from (0,0) to (9,9), so (3,9) is valid.\n\nBut there's no apple there, as far as I know.\n\nAlternatively, I can stay at (3,8) and look for another apple.\n\nBut I can't stay in the same place; I have to move each turn.\n\nWait, in this game, do I have to move each turn, or can I stay in place?\n\nThe rules say: if you move onto an apple, you grow and gain a point. If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\nThey don't specify what happens if you don't move. Maybe you have to move each turn.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that you must move each turn.\n\nTherefore, after eating (3,8), I need to decide where to go next without colliding with myself.\n\nLet me think ahead.\n\nIf I go to (3,8), then I can go to (3,9), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, I can go to (4,8) or (2,8), but I need to see if there are apples in those directions.\n\nLooking at the board, (4,8) is empty, and (2,8) is also empty.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (3,8), I should move to (3,9), then to (3,10), but (3,10) is out of bounds, so that's a wall.\n\nWait, the board is from (0,0) to (9,9), so (3,10) is outside, which is a wall.\n\nSo, I can't go to (3,9) because that's the edge, and next move, I'd hit the wall.\n\nTherefore, after eating (3,8), moving to (3,9) would be risky because next turn, I'd hit the wall unless there's another apple at (3,9).\n\nBut there isn't, as per the given positions.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider moving to (4,8) or (2,8) after eating (3,8).\n\nLooking at (2,8): is that safe? Is there any enemy there?\n\nThe enemy is at (3,3) with body at (3,4) and (2,4). So, (2,8) should be clear.\n\nBut there's no apple there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,8) seems clear.\n\nBut again, no apple.\n\nSo, maybe I should consider moving to (3,5) next.\n\nTo get from (3,8) to (3,5), I need to move down three steps: to (3,7), then (3,6), then (3,5).\n\nBut, as I move down, I need to ensure that those positions are not occupied by my body or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (3,8), my body is at (3,8) and (3,7).\n\nThen, moving to (3,7): but (3,7) is part of my body, so that would cause a collision.\n\nWait, no. After eating (3,8), my tail is at (3,7), but when I move to (3,7), my tail moves forward to (3,6), assuming I've grown.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nIn snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your body length increases.\n\nSo, after eating (3,8), my head is at (3,8), and my body is at (3,7).\n\nThen, if I move down to (3,7), my head moves to (3,7), and my tail moves to (3,8), since I've grown.\n\nBut (3,7) is already part of my body, so moving there would cause my head to be on my body, which should be fine because the tail is moving forward.\n\nWait, in many snake games, if your head moves to a position where your tail used to be, it's okay because the tail moves forward.\n\nBut in this case, since I"

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation. Our snake is currently at position (4, 3) and we've just moved right. We see that there are several apples available, but the closest one is at (3, 5), which is one position to the left and two positions above us. However, we also notice that Snake #2 is at position (3, 6), which is above the apple at (3, 5). This could be a potential threat.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (1, 0), which is three positions to the left and three positions below us. However, this move would put us in a vulnerable position, as we would be moving away from the center of the board and potentially into a corner.\n\nConsidering the current situation, I think it's best to move towards the apple at (3, 5). However, we should be cautious of Snake #2 and try to avoid a collision. To do this, we can move left first to get closer to the apple, and then reassess the situation.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving left, reassess the situation and decide whether to move up towards the apple at (3, 5) or explore other options.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this snake game. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is at (3,6), and I need to decide whether to go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nThere are apples at (3,5), (9,1), (3,8), (9,5), and (1,0). So, multiple targets here.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (4,3) with its body at (3,3), (3,4), and (2,4). So, I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Looking at the distances:\n\n- From (3,6) to (3,8): just two steps up.\n\n- To (3,5): down one step.\n\n- To (9,1): that's way over there, too far.\n\n- To (9,5): also far.\n\n- To (1,0): pretty far as well.\n\nSo, the closest apples are (3,8) and (3,5), both along the same X coordinate.\n\nLet me consider going for (3,8) first since it's higher up.\n\nBut I should check if the way is clear.\n\nIf I go UP from (3,6) to (3,7), then to (3,8), is that safe?\n\nLooking at the enemy's position: head at (4,3), body at (3,3), (3,4), and (2,4).\n\nSo, the enemy is below me, and its body is at lower Y coordinates.\n\nAt (3,7) and (3,8), there are no enemies, as far as I can tell.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (3,8), my next moves are safe.\n\nAfter eating (3,8), I'll be at (3,8), and I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,8), the next closest apple is (3,5), but that would require moving down three steps: to (3,7), (3,6), and (3,5).\n\nBut I need to ensure that my body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your body length increases by one segment.\n\nSo, after eating (3,8), my body will be at (3,7) and (3,6), assuming I've just eaten and grown.\n\nThen, if I move down to (3,7), my tail will move to (3,8), but (3,7) is already part of my body, which should be fine because the tail is moving forward.\n\nWait, in many snake games, moving your head onto a position where your tail used to be is okay because the tail moves forward in the next move.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my head doesn't end up on any part of my body except the tail tip.\n\nIn this case, after eating (3,8), my body is at (3,8) and (3,7).\n\nIf I move to (3,7), my tail moves to (3,6), assuming I've grown.\n\nSo, my body would then be at (3,7), (3,8), and (3,6).\n\nBut my head is moving to (3,7), and the tail is moving from (3,7) to (3,6).\n\nWait, that might not make sense.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIn snake games, typically, each move advances the head in the chosen direction, and the tail moves forward by one segment, unless the snake has grown by eating an apple.\n\nSo, if I eat an apple at (3,8), my snake grows, meaning my tail stays in place.\n\nThen, when I move to (3,7), my head moves to (3,7), and the tail remains at (3,6), since I've grown.\n\nTherefore, (3,7) is now part of my body, and moving to it would cause my head to be on my body, which should be okay because the tail is moving forward.\n\nBut in reality, in most snake games, if your head moves to a position already occupied by your body, you die, even if the tail is moving forward.\n\nSo, I need to be careful about that.\n\nPerhaps it's better to choose a different path.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (3,8), I could move to (4,8) or (2,8), to get away from my body.\n\nBut there are no apples in those directions.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I should go for the closer apple at (3,5) first.\n\nFrom (3,6), moving down to (3,5), there are no enemies in between.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's see, from (3,5), the next closest apple is at (9,5), which is quite far, or (9,1), which is also far.\n\nBut going for (3,5) first might be simpler.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy's movement.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,3) with body at (3,3), (3,4), and (2,4).\n\nI need to predict where the enemy might go.\n\nIf the enemy is trying to eat apples or come after me, I need to anticipate its moves.\n\nBut for now, since it's several steps away, I can focus on getting to (3,5).\n\nSo, moving from (3,6) to (3,5) is just one step down.\n\nIs that position clear?\n\nLooking at the board, (3,5) is an apple, and surrounding areas seem clear.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I'll be at (3,5), and my tail will be at (3,6).\n\nThen, I can consider moving to (3,4), but there's no apple there, and the enemy is at (3,3), (3,4), and (2,4).\n\nSo, moving down further might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving to (4,5) or (2,5), but there are no apples there.\n\nLooking at the board, (9,5) is an apple, but that's too far to go right now.\n\nMaybe after eating (3,5), I can head towards (9,5), but I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,3), and its body is at (3,3), (3,4), and (2,4).\n\nSo, it's below me, and it might be moving upwards to reach apples or to come after me.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't let my tail get too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (9,1), which is at (9,1).\n\nBut that's quite far, and I'd have to navigate around the enemy.\n\nLet me think about the board layout.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with apples at (3,5), (9,1), (3,8), (9,5), and (1,0).\n\nMy position is (3,6), and the enemy is at (4,3) with body at (3,3), (3,4), and (2,4).\n\nI need a strategy to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nOne approach is to go for the closest apples first and try to create a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples in sequence without trapping myself.\n\nGiven that, going for (3,8) first seems attractive because it's close, and then potentially moving to (9,5) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, the path to (3,8) is straightforward, but after eating it, I need to be careful not to collide with my own body.\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,5) is just one step down, which is even simpler.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider moving towards (9,5), but that's a long way, and I have to cross the board, possibly encountering the enemy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (9,1) first.\n\nFrom (3,6), moving to (9,1) would require moving right to (9,6), then down to (9,1).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I'd have to pass through areas where the enemy might be.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (9,5), which is in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider collecting the apples in a way that allows me to grow sufficiently to defend against the enemy.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nLet me consider a simpler strategy: go for the closest apple, which is (3,5), then proceed to (9,5), then to (9,1), and finally to (1,0).\n\nBut that seems like a lot of ground to cover, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or my own body in the process.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to collect the apples in a more clustered area first.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (3,5) and (3,8) are along the same column, which might be easier to navigate.\n\nAfter eating (3,8), I can move down to (3,5), but as I thought earlier"
