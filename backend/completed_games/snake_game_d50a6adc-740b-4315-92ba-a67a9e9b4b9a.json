As the snake has the chance to turn left and head upwards, this might put me at a risk. \n\nAlternatively, I can go for the apple at (7,9) by heading straight upwards. But, this movement will take me away from the remainder of the apples on the board and potentially limit my future minimal-distance moves to accumulate points.\n\nThe apple at (7, 2) continues to remain an intriguing option as it allows me to stay more centrally positioned on the board. While it is currently far, I can consider starting to head in that direction. \n\nRationale:\n\nConsidering my score and remaining apples, it may be unwise to risk too early in the game by attempting to collect the apple near the rival snake. The best strategy for now seems to be starting to move towards the apple at (7, 2). This requires me to head right for two moves and then down. \n\nI can get to the apple by decreasing my vertical distance first and then covering the horizontal distance. However, covering the horizontal distance first will keep me closer to both rival snake and the apples for longer. Also, in case the rival snake starts moving upwards, we can swiftly change our direction without fear of a head on collision.\n\nTherefore, my next move will be: RIGHT."
