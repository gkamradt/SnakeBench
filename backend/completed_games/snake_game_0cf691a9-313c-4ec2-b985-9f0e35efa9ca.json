There's an enemy snake at (6,6) which I need to avoid\n\nThe most efficient move would be to go DOWN to get the apple at (9,8). This is the safest and most immediate reward. After getting this apple, I can then plan a route to either (8,5) or consider other apples while staying away from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After getting the apple at (9,8), I'll probably want to move left to position myself for getting the apple at (8,5), but I'll need to reassess based on where the enemy snake moves.\n\nDirection: DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nFirst, the board is set up with the snake ID 2 at position (6,6). The board has some apples at positions (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). The snake's body is currently at (6,6), so it's moving towards the right and down. \n\nThe board state shows that the snake is in the middle of the board, and there are apples scattered around. The snake's body is mostly empty, except for the last few positions. The apples are at (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). \n\nThe rules are important here. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. But if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to be careful not to move into any of these areas.\n\nLooking at the current position (6,6), the snake's body is mostly empty except for the last few segments. The snake is moving towards the right and down. The apples are at (5,5), which is to the left and below the snake's current position. The other apples are at (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). \n\nI should check the neighboring cells to see if moving into any of them would cause me to die. The snake's body is at (6,6), so the cells around it are (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,7), (5,4), (5,7), (7,4), (7,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), etc. Wait, maybe I should visualize the board.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . 1\n8 . . . . . . . . . A\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . A . . 2 . . .\n5 . . . . . A . . A .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. Each row represents a y-coordinate, from 9 at the top to 0 at the bottom. Each column is an x-coordinate from 0 at the left to 9 at the right.\n\nSo, the first row is y=9, which is the top row. The snake is at (6,6), which is the middle of the board. The apples are at (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5).\n\nWait, (3,6) is in the same row as the snake's current position (6,6). So, if the snake moves down, it would enter (3,6), which is an apple. But wait, the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving into (3,6) would require the snake to have a body segment there. But the snake's body is mostly empty except for the last few segments. So, if the snake moves down, it would enter (3,6), which is an apple. But wait, the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving down would take it to (7,6), which is empty. Wait, no, the snake's body is at (6,6), so the next position would be (7,6). But (3,6) is to the left of (6,6). So, if the snake moves left, it would enter (5,6), which is empty. But if it moves down, it would enter (7,6), which is empty. Wait, but the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of the snake's current position. So, if the snake moves left, it would enter (5,6), which is empty. But the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of (6,6). So, moving left would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty, but the apple is at (3,6). So, moving left would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty, but the apple is at (3,6). So, moving left would not land on an apple. Wait, but the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving left would take it to (5,6), which is empty. So, no apple there.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of (6,6). So, moving left from (6,6) would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty. So, no apple there. So, moving left would not land on an apple.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is at (6,6), so the next position is (7,6). So, moving down from (6,6) would take the snake to (7,6), which is empty.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nFirst, the board is set up with the snake ID 2 at position (6,6). The board has some apples at positions (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). The snake's body is currently at (6,6), so it's moving towards the right and down. \n\nThe board state shows that the snake is in the middle of the board, and there are apples scattered around. The snake's body is mostly empty, except for the last few positions. The apples are at (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). \n\nThe rules are important here. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. But if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to be careful not to move into any of these areas.\n\nLooking at the current position (6,6), the snake's body is mostly empty except for the last few segments. The snake is moving towards the right and down. The apples are at (5,5), which is to the left and below the snake's current position. The other apples are at (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). \n\nI should check the neighboring cells to see if moving into any of them would cause me to die. The snake's body is at (6,6), so the cells around it are (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,7), (5,4), (5,7), (7,4), (7,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), etc. Wait, maybe I should visualize the board.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . 1\n8 . . . . . . . . . A\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . A . . 2 . . .\n5 . . . . . A . . A .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. Each row represents a y-coordinate, from 9 at the top to 0 at the bottom. Each column is an x-coordinate from 0 at the left to 9 at the right.\n\nSo, the first row is y=9, which is the top row. The snake is at (6,6), which is the middle of the board. The apples are at (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5).\n\nWait, (3,6) is in the same row as the snake's current position (6,6). So, if the snake moves down, it would enter (3,6), which is an apple. But wait, the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving into (3,6) would require the snake to have a body segment there. But the snake's body is mostly empty except for the last few segments. So, if the snake moves down, it would enter (3,6), which is an apple. But wait, the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving down would take it to (7,6), which is empty. Wait, no, the snake's body is at (6,6), so the next position would be (7,6). But (3,6) is to the left of (6,6). So, if the snake moves left, it would enter (5,6), which is empty. But if it moves down, it would enter (7,6), which is empty. Wait, but the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of the snake's current position. So, if the snake moves left, it would enter (5,6), which is empty. But the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of (6,6). So, moving left would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty, but the apple is at (3,6). So, moving left would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty, but the apple is at (3,6). So, moving left would not land on an apple. Wait, but the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving left would take it to (5,6), which is empty. So, no apple there.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of (6,6). So, moving left from (6,6) would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty. So, no apple there. So, moving left would not land on an apple.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is at (6,6), so the next position is (7,6). So, moving down from (6,6) would take the snake to (7,6), which is empty.

There's an enemy snake at (6,6) which I need to avoid\n\nThe most efficient move would be to go DOWN to get the apple at (9,8). This is the safest and most immediate reward. After getting this apple, I can then plan a route to either (8,5) or consider other apples while staying away from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After getting the apple at (9,8), I'll probably want to move left to position myself for getting the apple at (8,5), but I'll need to reassess based on where the enemy snake moves.\n\nDirection: DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nFirst, the board is set up with the snake ID 2 at position (6,6). The board has some apples at positions (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). The snake's body is currently at (6,6), so it's moving towards the right and down. \n\nThe board state shows that the snake is in the middle of the board, and there are apples scattered around. The snake's body is mostly empty, except for the last few positions. The apples are at (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). \n\nThe rules are important here. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. But if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to be careful not to move into any of these areas.\n\nLooking at the current position (6,6), the snake's body is mostly empty except for the last few segments. The snake is moving towards the right and down. The apples are at (5,5), which is to the left and below the snake's current position. The other apples are at (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). \n\nI should check the neighboring cells to see if moving into any of them would cause me to die. The snake's body is at (6,6), so the cells around it are (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,7), (5,4), (5,7), (7,4), (7,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), etc. Wait, maybe I should visualize the board.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . 1\n8 . . . . . . . . . A\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . A . . 2 . . .\n5 . . . . . A . . A .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. Each row represents a y-coordinate, from 9 at the top to 0 at the bottom. Each column is an x-coordinate from 0 at the left to 9 at the right.\n\nSo, the first row is y=9, which is the top row. The snake is at (6,6), which is the middle of the board. The apples are at (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5).\n\nWait, (3,6) is in the same row as the snake's current position (6,6). So, if the snake moves down, it would enter (3,6), which is an apple. But wait, the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving into (3,6) would require the snake to have a body segment there. But the snake's body is mostly empty except for the last few segments. So, if the snake moves down, it would enter (3,6), which is an apple. But wait, the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving down would take it to (7,6), which is empty. Wait, no, the snake's body is at (6,6), so the next position would be (7,6). But (3,6) is to the left of (6,6). So, if the snake moves left, it would enter (5,6), which is empty. But if it moves down, it would enter (7,6), which is empty. Wait, but the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of the snake's current position. So, if the snake moves left, it would enter (5,6), which is empty. But the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of (6,6). So, moving left would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty, but the apple is at (3,6). So, moving left would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty, but the apple is at (3,6). So, moving left would not land on an apple. Wait, but the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving left would take it to (5,6), which is empty. So, no apple there.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of (6,6). So, moving left from (6,6) would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty. So, no apple there. So, moving left would not land on an apple.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is at (6,6), so the next position is (7,6). So, moving down from (6,6) would take the snake to (7,6), which is empty.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nFirst, the board is set up with the snake ID 2 at position (6,6). The board has some apples at positions (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). The snake's body is currently at (6,6), so it's moving towards the right and down. \n\nThe board state shows that the snake is in the middle of the board, and there are apples scattered around. The snake's body is mostly empty, except for the last few positions. The apples are at (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). \n\nThe rules are important here. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. But if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to be careful not to move into any of these areas.\n\nLooking at the current position (6,6), the snake's body is mostly empty except for the last few segments. The snake is moving towards the right and down. The apples are at (5,5), which is to the left and below the snake's current position. The other apples are at (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5). \n\nI should check the neighboring cells to see if moving into any of them would cause me to die. The snake's body is at (6,6), so the cells around it are (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,7), (5,4), (5,7), (7,4), (7,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), etc. Wait, maybe I should visualize the board.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . 1\n8 . . . . . . . . . A\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . A . . 2 . . .\n5 . . . . . A . . A .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. Each row represents a y-coordinate, from 9 at the top to 0 at the bottom. Each column is an x-coordinate from 0 at the left to 9 at the right.\n\nSo, the first row is y=9, which is the top row. The snake is at (6,6), which is the middle of the board. The apples are at (5,5), (9,1), (3,6), (9,8), and (8,5).\n\nWait, (3,6) is in the same row as the snake's current position (6,6). So, if the snake moves down, it would enter (3,6), which is an apple. But wait, the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving into (3,6) would require the snake to have a body segment there. But the snake's body is mostly empty except for the last few segments. So, if the snake moves down, it would enter (3,6), which is an apple. But wait, the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving down would take it to (7,6), which is empty. Wait, no, the snake's body is at (6,6), so the next position would be (7,6). But (3,6) is to the left of (6,6). So, if the snake moves left, it would enter (5,6), which is empty. But if it moves down, it would enter (7,6), which is empty. Wait, but the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of the snake's current position. So, if the snake moves left, it would enter (5,6), which is empty. But the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of (6,6). So, moving left would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty, but the apple is at (3,6). So, moving left would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty, but the apple is at (3,6). So, moving left would not land on an apple. Wait, but the snake's body is at (6,6), so moving left would take it to (5,6), which is empty. So, no apple there.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (3,6), which is to the left of (6,6). So, moving left from (6,6) would take the snake to (5,6), which is empty. So, no apple there.

RIGHT: Would move towards the wall, not advisable\n4. UP: Would move back towards where I came from, not optimal\n\nThe enemy snake at (7, 6) is slightly concerning as it could potentially move to block my path to the apple at (8, 5). However, I still think continuing DOWN is my best option because:\n\n1. The apple at (8, 5) is still the closest and most directly accessible\n2. Even if the enemy snake moves to block me, I can adjust my course to target (6, 4) or (5, 5)\n3. Moving LEFT would take me further from the nearest apple\n\nStrategy for next turn: If the enemy snake moves to block my path to (8, 5), I should consider moving LEFT to target the cluster of apples at (6, 4) and (5, 5).\n\nDirection: DOWN"
