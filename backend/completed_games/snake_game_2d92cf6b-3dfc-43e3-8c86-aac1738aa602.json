This move directly reduces the x-gap by one while keeping us clear of obstacles. The board shows (4,2) is empty, and none of our snake\u2019s own or enemy segments occupy that square. \n\nPlan for the next turn: after moving LEFT, the next move will be to move UP from (4,2) so we can reach the apple at (4,3). This strategy minimizes the Manhattan distance to our target while keeping our move safe.\n\nMy next move: LEFT."

Based on the last information, the second snake seems occupied elsewhere which lessens the threat towards me. The movement of the second snake must always be considered when making decisions, as any collision with it, its path, or the board edges would result in a loss which would be highly unfavorable.\n\nThe location of all other apples are either currently inaccessible or would require going through Snake #2, which is high risk. Therefore, the best strategy is to proceed downwards towards the apple at (4,3),  increasing my length and score, then reassessing the situation.\n\nIn the next turn, after reaching the apple, I'll consider a safe route to the next closest apple, keeping in mind the goal to gain points without dying while avoiding any potential risk.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

Moreover, the apple I originally targeted at (4, 3) has been claimed by Snake #2. Therefore, a change of direction is necessary. Snake #2's body obstructs the path to the lower half of the board, so the best strategy now is to aim for the apples on the upper half. \n\nLet's examine the apple locations again: (2, 8), (6, 9), (1, 7), (0, 7), (5, 8). The closest apple is at (5, 8), and I can snake my way upwards first then right to claim it, as long as Snake #2 doesn't change direction and threaten me. \n\nAfter consuming the apple at (5, 8), the next obvious target would be the apple at (6, 9) so as to maximize the food available in the relatively safe upper region of the board. \n\nGiven the current game state, I need to continuously monitor Snake #2's movements and ensure that I don't get trapped in a position where I can't avoid running into its body, the walls or myself. \n\nDecided next move: UP."

We now have several apples on the board at (2,8), (6,9), (1,7), (0,7) and (5,8). Evaluating distances, the apple at (5,8) is closest (from (4,3) it\u2019s 1 to the right plus 5 up, for a Manhattan distance of 6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\u2022 Our own tail or body occupies cells behind us (for example, (4,2) is no longer safe as it\u2019s part of our body).\n\u2022 The enemy snake (#1) is at (4,5) with a body segment at (4,6). This enemy is above us, so moving upward might run us closer to its head\u2014risking a potential head-to-head collision if that enemy decides to move down or if paths cross.\n\nFrom (4,3) our legal moves are:\n\u2013 UP to (4,4): This brings us one step closer vertically toward the apples, but places us in a path toward the enemy snake that is at (4,5).\n\u2013 LEFT to (3,3): That keeps a safe distance from the enemy, but it diverts us from the direction of our target.\n\u2013 RIGHT to (5,3): This move is safe and immediately aligns us horizontally with the apple at (5,8) while avoiding any immediate proximity with the enemy snake.\n\u2013 DOWN (to (4,2)) is unsafe because that's our own body.\n\nGiven these, moving RIGHT looks like a safe and strategic choice that doesn\u2019t risk coming too near to the enemy snake\u2019s head while still progressing toward the nearest apple.\n\nMy next move is: RIGHT."
