            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). The apples are located at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (1,6) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (2,0), which is on the bottom row, third cell from the left. There's an apple at (4,0), which is two cells to the right of me. Another apple at (7,1), which is a bit diagonally up and to the right. Then there's (5,4), which is up and to the right as well. (5,6) is higher up, and (8,6) is even further to the right.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Going for the closest one might be best to maximize points quickly. The apple at (4,0) is right next to me, only two moves away. But I should consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, there's another snake at (1,6), which is up and to the left. Since its body is empty, it's probably just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into walls or myself. Since I'm at (2,0), moving left would take me to (1,0), and then to (0,0), but I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\n1. Go right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. Alternatively, move up to (2,1), then to (2,2), and so on, to reach other apples.\n\nBut option 1 seems quicker for getting the first apple.\n\nWait, but if I go right to (3,0), then to (4,0), I'll eat the apple at (4,0). After that, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me see the distance to other apples from there.\n\nFrom (4,0), the apple at (7,1) is three right and up one.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is up four and right one.\n\n(5,6) is up six and right one.\n\n(8,6) is up six and right four.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (7,1) next would be logical, since it's closer.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. If it's at (1,6), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or direction.\n\nMaybe I should try to predict its movement. If it's trying to get to an apple, it might go for the one at (5,6) or (8,6), which are both at y=6.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting as many apples as possible without worrying too much about the other snake for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to block the other snake's path to certain apples, but that might be risky.\n\nFor now, I think the best approach is to get the closest apples first and try to maximize my score before worrying about the other snake.\n\nSo, starting by going right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can decide to move up to (4,1), then to (4,2), and so on, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can move up to (4,1), then right to (5,1), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better plan is to move right to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then to (4,1), and then to (5,1), aiming for the apple at (7,1).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should just go straight up from (4,0) towards (4,1), (4,2), and so on.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the order in which to eat the apples to minimize the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at all the apple positions:\n\n(4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), (7,1)\n\nStarting from (2,0), closest is (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nSo, a possible path is (2,0) -> (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 steps right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (7,1): 3 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (5,4): 2 steps left, 3 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 steps right.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + (3+1) + (2+3) + 2 + 3 = 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16 steps.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Maybe if I go to (7,1) directly from (2,0).\n\nLet's see: from (2,0) to (7,1): 5 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nBut I need to go through (4,0) first to eat that apple.\n\nWait, but if I go directly to (7,1), I can eat that apple and then go to (4,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, no. If I go to (7,1) first, then to (4,0), that would be:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,1): 5 right, 1 up.\n\nThen from (7,1) to (4,0): 3 left, 1 down.\n\nTotal: 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10 steps.\n\nThen from (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nThen to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nThen to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nTotal: 10 + (1 + 4) + 2 + 3 = 10 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 20 steps.\n\nWait, that's more than the previous path.\n\nSo, the first path is better with 16 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eat (4,0), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6), then (7,1).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (7,1): 1 left, 5 down.\n\nTotal: 2 + (1+4) + 2 + 3 + (1 + 5) = 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 18 steps.\n\nStill more than 16.\n\nSo, the initial path seems best.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the other snake is at (1,6), and assuming it's moving towards one of the apples at y=6, I need to be cautious when moving up to higher y coordinates.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples at lower y coordinates first, before moving up.\n\nSo, eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nThat way, I'm staying lower on the board initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to eat (4,0), then move up to (5,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the positions more carefully.\n\nLet me try to plot this path step by step.\n\nStarting at (2,0):\n\n1. Right to (3,0)\n\n2. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nNow, my tail is at (2,0).\n\nNext moves:\n\n3. Up to (4,1)\n\n4. Right to (5,1)\n\n5. Up to (5,2)\n\n6. Up to (5,3)\n\n7. Right to (6,3)\n\nWait, this seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Up to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2)\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. My snake is number 2, currently at position (1,0). There are apples at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (2,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, myself, or the other snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. At the bottom row, y=0: there's an apple at (4,0), and I'm at (1,0). At y=1, there's an apple at (7,1). At y=4, there's an apple at (5,4). At y=6, there are apples at (5,6) and (8,6).\n\nSo, the apples are spread out vertically and horizontally. I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple to minimize the moves and time spent. The closest apple is at (4,0), which is straight to the right from my current position at (1,0). It's only three steps to the right.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. Will growing make it harder for me to maneuver? Also, I need to consider the position of the other snake and plan to avoid it.\n\nThe other snake is at (2,6), which is up and to the right from my position. If I go for the apple at (4,0), I'll be moving to the right, away from the other snake initially.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,0), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves.\n\nStarting at (1,0):\n\n1. Right to (2,0)\n\n2. Right to (3,0)\n\n3. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nNow, from (4,0), I can look for the next apple. The closest one would be (7,1), which is three steps right and one step up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear. Let's see:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Right to (6,0)\n\n- Right to (7,0)\n\n- Up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nBut wait, at (7,0), is there any obstacle? From the board, it seems clear, but I need to confirm.\n\nAlso, I need to keep an eye on the other snake's position. If it's moving down towards me, I need to adjust my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (5,4) next, which is up and to the right.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (5,4) from (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nComparing that to going to (7,1), which is four moves from (4,0).\n\nSo, going to (7,1) is quicker.\n\nAfter eating (7,1), I can then aim for (5,4), which is two left and three up from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves in total from (7,1) to (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could go to (8,1), then (8,2), and so on to (8,6), but that seems farther.\n\nI think the initial plan is better: (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. From (1,0) to (4,0): 3 rights\n\n2. From (4,0) to (7,1): 3 rights, 1 up\n\n3. From (7,1) to (5,4): 2 lefts, 3 ups\n\n4. From (5,4) to (5,6): 2 ups\n\n5. From (5,6) to (8,6): 3 rights\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 17 moves.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nAlso, considering the other snake is at (2,6), and assuming it's moving down towards me, I need to be careful when I'm moving up.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the lower apples first and then moving up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to eat the apple at (5,4) directly after (4,0), instead of (7,1).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (5,4) to (7,1):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Down to (7,3)\n\n- Down to (7,2)\n\n- Down to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nThat's five more moves.\n\nTotal: 3 (to (4,0)) + 5 + 5 = 13 moves.\n\nWait, that seems better than the previous plan.\n\nBut actually, in the previous plan, it was 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 moves to get to (5,4) via (7,1), but in this plan, it's 3 + 5 + 5 = 13 moves.\n\nSo, the first plan is better in terms of moves.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the risk of running into the other snake.\n\nIf I move up to higher y coordinates, I might encounter the other snake.\n\nMaybe it's safer to stay lower on the board for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to eat the apple at (7,1) first, then (5,4), then (5,6), and so on.\n\nLet me think about the positions of the apples and the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (2,6), and if it's trying to get to the apples at y=6, it might be moving towards (5,6) or (8,6).\n\nIf I can stay away from y=6 until the other snake has eaten one of those apples, maybe I can sneak in and get the other one.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to eat the apples at y=6 first before the other snake can get to them.\n\nBut that might be risky.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's better to focus on the lower apples first.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Eat the apple at (4,0)\n\n2. Then eat the apple at (7,1)\n\n3. Then eat the apple at (5,4)\n\n4. Then eat the apple at (5,6)\n\n5. Finally, eat the apple at (8,6)\n\nLet me think about the moves again.\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so I need to be careful not to turn back onto my tail.\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Up to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\n- Right to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nNow, my snake has grown again.\n\nFrom (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Up to (5,6) - eat apple\n\nFrom (5,6):\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6) - eat apple\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 17 moves.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into the other snake.\n\nLet me consider the other snake's possible movements.\n\nAssuming the other snake at (2,6) is also trying to eat the apples at y=6, it might move towards (5,6) or (8,6).\n\nIf it moves towards (5,6), it would need to move left"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). The apples are located at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (1,6) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (2,0), which is on the bottom row, third cell from the left. There's an apple at (4,0), which is two cells to the right of me. Another apple at (7,1), which is a bit diagonally up and to the right. Then there's (5,4), which is up and to the right as well. (5,6) is higher up, and (8,6) is even further to the right.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Going for the closest one might be best to maximize points quickly. The apple at (4,0) is right next to me, only two moves away. But I should consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, there's another snake at (1,6), which is up and to the left. Since its body is empty, it's probably just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into walls or myself. Since I'm at (2,0), moving left would take me to (1,0), and then to (0,0), but I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\n1. Go right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. Alternatively, move up to (2,1), then to (2,2), and so on, to reach other apples.\n\nBut option 1 seems quicker for getting the first apple.\n\nWait, but if I go right to (3,0), then to (4,0), I'll eat the apple at (4,0). After that, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me see the distance to other apples from there.\n\nFrom (4,0), the apple at (7,1) is three right and up one.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is up four and right one.\n\n(5,6) is up six and right one.\n\n(8,6) is up six and right four.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (7,1) next would be logical, since it's closer.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. If it's at (1,6), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or direction.\n\nMaybe I should try to predict its movement. If it's trying to get to an apple, it might go for the one at (5,6) or (8,6), which are both at y=6.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting as many apples as possible without worrying too much about the other snake for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to block the other snake's path to certain apples, but that might be risky.\n\nFor now, I think the best approach is to get the closest apples first and try to maximize my score before worrying about the other snake.\n\nSo, starting by going right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can decide to move up to (4,1), then to (4,2), and so on, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can move up to (4,1), then right to (5,1), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better plan is to move right to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then to (4,1), and then to (5,1), aiming for the apple at (7,1).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should just go straight up from (4,0) towards (4,1), (4,2), and so on.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the order in which to eat the apples to minimize the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at all the apple positions:\n\n(4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), (7,1)\n\nStarting from (2,0), closest is (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nSo, a possible path is (2,0) -> (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 steps right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (7,1): 3 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (5,4): 2 steps left, 3 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 steps right.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + (3+1) + (2+3) + 2 + 3 = 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16 steps.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Maybe if I go to (7,1) directly from (2,0).\n\nLet's see: from (2,0) to (7,1): 5 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nBut I need to go through (4,0) first to eat that apple.\n\nWait, but if I go directly to (7,1), I can eat that apple and then go to (4,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, no. If I go to (7,1) first, then to (4,0), that would be:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,1): 5 right, 1 up.\n\nThen from (7,1) to (4,0): 3 left, 1 down.\n\nTotal: 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10 steps.\n\nThen from (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nThen to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nThen to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nTotal: 10 + (1 + 4) + 2 + 3 = 10 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 20 steps.\n\nWait, that's more than the previous path.\n\nSo, the first path is better with 16 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eat (4,0), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6), then (7,1).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (7,1): 1 left, 5 down.\n\nTotal: 2 + (1+4) + 2 + 3 + (1 + 5) = 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 18 steps.\n\nStill more than 16.\n\nSo, the initial path seems best.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the other snake is at (1,6), and assuming it's moving towards one of the apples at y=6, I need to be cautious when moving up to higher y coordinates.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples at lower y coordinates first, before moving up.\n\nSo, eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nThat way, I'm staying lower on the board initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to eat (4,0), then move up to (5,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the positions more carefully.\n\nLet me try to plot this path step by step.\n\nStarting at (2,0):\n\n1.

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. My snake is number 2, currently at position (0,0). There are apples at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (3,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, myself, or the other snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. At the bottom row, y=0: there's an apple at (4,0), and I'm at (0,0). At y=1, there's an apple at (7,1). At y=4, there's an apple at (5,4). At y=6, there are apples at (5,6) and (8,6).\n\nSo, the apples are spread out vertically and horizontally. I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple to minimize the moves and time spent. The closest apple is at (4,0), which is straight to the right from my current position at (0,0). It's four steps to the right.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. Will growing make it harder for me to maneuver? Also, I need to consider the position of the other snake and plan to avoid it.\n\nThe other snake is at (3,6), which is up and to the right from my position. If I go for the apple at (4,0), I'll be moving to the right, away from the other snake initially.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,0), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. Right to (1,0)\n\n2. Right to (2,0)\n\n3. Right to (3,0)\n\n4. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nNow, from (4,0), I can look for the next apple.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). The apples are located at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (1,6) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (2,0), which is on the bottom row, third cell from the left. There's an apple at (4,0), which is two cells to the right of me. Another apple at (7,1), which is a bit diagonally up and to the right. Then there's (5,4), which is up and to the right as well. (5,6) is higher up, and (8,6) is even further to the right.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Going for the closest one might be best to maximize points quickly. The apple at (4,0) is right next to me, only two moves away. But I should consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, there's another snake at (1,6), which is up and to the left. Since its body is empty, it's probably just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into walls or myself. Since I'm at (2,0), moving left would take me to (1,0), and then to (0,0), but I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\n1. Go right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. Alternatively, move up to (2,1), then to (2,2), and so on, to reach other apples.\n\nBut option 1 seems quicker for getting the first apple.\n\nWait, but if I go right to (3,0), then to (4,0), I'll eat the apple at (4,0). After that, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me see the distance to other apples from there.\n\nFrom (4,0), the apple at (7,1) is three right and up one.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is up four and right one.\n\n(5,6) is up six and right one.\n\n(8,6) is up six and right four.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (7,1) next would be logical, since it's closer.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. If it's at (1,6), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or direction.\n\nMaybe I should try to predict its movement. If it's trying to get to an apple, it might go for the one at (5,6) or (8,6), which are both at y=6.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting as many apples as possible without worrying too much about the other snake for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to block the other snake's path to certain apples, but that might be risky.\n\nFor now, I think the best approach is to get the closest apples first and try to maximize my score before worrying about the other snake.\n\nSo, starting by going right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can decide to move up to (4,1), then to (4,2), and so on, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can move up to (4,1), then right to (5,1), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better plan is to move right to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then to (4,1), and then to (5,1), aiming for the apple at (7,1).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should just go straight up from (4,0) towards (4,1), (4,2), and so on.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the order in which to eat the apples to minimize the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at all the apple positions:\n\n(4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), (7,1)\n\nStarting from (2,0), closest is (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nSo, a possible path is (2,0) -> (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 steps right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (7,1): 3 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (5,4): 2 steps left, 3 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 steps right.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + (3+1) + (2+3) + 2 + 3 = 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16 steps.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Maybe if I go to (7,1) directly from (2,0).\n\nLet's see: from (2,0) to (7,1): 5 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nBut I need to go through (4,0) first to eat that apple.\n\nWait, but if I go directly to (7,1), I can eat that apple and then go to (4,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, no. If I go to (7,1) first, then to (4,0), that would be:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,1): 5 right, 1 up.\n\nThen from (7,1) to (4,0): 3 left, 1 down.\n\nTotal: 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10 steps.\n\nThen from (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nThen to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nThen to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nTotal: 10 + (1 + 4) + 2 + 3 = 10 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 20 steps.\n\nWait, that's more than the previous path.\n\nSo, the first path is better with 16 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eat (4,0), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6), then (7,1).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (7,1): 1 left, 5 down.\n\nTotal: 2 + (1+4) + 2 + 3 + (1 + 5) = 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 18 steps.\n\nStill more than 16.\n\nSo, the initial path seems best.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the other snake is at (1,6), and assuming it's moving towards one of the apples at y=6, I need to be cautious when moving up to higher y coordinates.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples at lower y coordinates first, before moving up.\n\nSo, eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nThat way, I'm staying lower on the board initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to eat (4,0), then move up to (5,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the positions more carefully.\n\nLet me try to plot this path step by step.\n\nStarting at (2,0):\n\n1.

If I go to (5,4), I'm moving up to y=4, and the other snake is at y=6.\n\nAssuming the other snake moves down towards the apples at y=6, I might be safe for now.\n\nThen, from (5,4) to (5,6), I'm moving up to y=6, where the other snake is.\n\nThis could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to eat (5,4), then go to (8,6), skipping (5,6).\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (5,6), so I don't want to skip it.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (8,6), then (5,6), then (5,4).\n\nWait, but that seems farther.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to prioritize apples from bottom to top, left to right.\n\nSo, eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nThis way, I'm moving upwards and to the right gradually, avoiding the other snake.\n\nBut earlier calculations show that it's more moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should eat (4,0), then (5,4), then (7,1), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nWait, that might not be better.\n\nI need to find the optimal path that minimizes the total moves while avoiding the other snake.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just stick with the initial plan: eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nSo, for now, my immediate goal is to move to (4,0).\n\nFrom (1,0), I need to move right three times.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, from (1,0) to (4,0):\n\n- (1,0) to (2,0): clear\n\n- (2,0) to (3,0): clear\n\n- (3,0) to (4,0): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter eating (4,0), I need to move to (7,1).\n\nFrom (4,0), move right to (5,0), then (6,0), then (7,0), then up to (7,1).\n\nAgain, checking the path:\n\n- (4,0) to (5,0): clear\n\n- (5,0) to (6,0): clear\n\n- (6,0) to (7,0): clear\n\n- (7,0) to (7,1): apple\n\nLooks good.\n\nThen, from (7,1), I need to move to (5,4).\n\nFrom (7,1), left to (6,1), left to (5,1), up to (5,2), up to (5,3), up to (5,4).\n\nChecking the path:\n\n- (7,1) to (6,1): clear\n\n- (6,1) to"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). The apples are located at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (1,6) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (2,0), which is on the bottom row, third cell from the left. There's an apple at (4,0), which is two cells to the right of me. Another apple at (7,1), which is a bit diagonally up and to the right. Then there's (5,4), which is up and to the right as well. (5,6) is higher up, and (8,6) is even further to the right.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Going for the closest one might be best to maximize points quickly. The apple at (4,0) is right next to me, only two moves away. But I should consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, there's another snake at (1,6), which is up and to the left. Since its body is empty, it's probably just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into walls or myself. Since I'm at (2,0), moving left would take me to (1,0), and then to (0,0), but I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\n1. Go right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. Alternatively, move up to (2,1), then to (2,2), and so on, to reach other apples.\n\nBut option 1 seems quicker for getting the first apple.\n\nWait, but if I go right to (3,0), then to (4,0), I'll eat the apple at (4,0). After that, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me see the distance to other apples from there.\n\nFrom (4,0), the apple at (7,1) is three right and up one.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is up four and right one.\n\n(5,6) is up six and right one.\n\n(8,6) is up six and right four.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (7,1) next would be logical, since it's closer.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. If it's at (1,6), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or direction.\n\nMaybe I should try to predict its movement. If it's trying to get to an apple, it might go for the one at (5,6) or (8,6), which are both at y=6.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting as many apples as possible without worrying too much about the other snake for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to block the other snake's path to certain apples, but that might be risky.\n\nFor now, I think the best approach is to get the closest apples first and try to maximize my score before worrying about the other snake.\n\nSo, starting by going right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can decide to move up to (4,1), then to (4,2), and so on, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can move up to (4,1), then right to (5,1), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better plan is to move right to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then to (4,1), and then to (5,1), aiming for the apple at (7,1).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should just go straight up from (4,0) towards (4,1), (4,2), and so on.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the order in which to eat the apples to minimize the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at all the apple positions:\n\n(4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), (7,1)\n\nStarting from (2,0), closest is (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nSo, a possible path is (2,0) -> (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 steps right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (7,1): 3 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (5,4): 2 steps left, 3 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 steps right.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + (3+1) + (2+3) + 2 + 3 = 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16 steps.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Maybe if I go to (7,1) directly from (2,0).\n\nLet's see: from (2,0) to (7,1): 5 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nBut I need to go through (4,0) first to eat that apple.\n\nWait, but if I go directly to (7,1), I can eat that apple and then go to (4,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, no. If I go to (7,1) first, then to (4,0), that would be:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,1): 5 right, 1 up.\n\nThen from (7,1) to (4,0): 3 left, 1 down.\n\nTotal: 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10 steps.\n\nThen from (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nThen to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nThen to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nTotal: 10 + (1 + 4) + 2 + 3 = 10 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 20 steps.\n\nWait, that's more than the previous path.\n\nSo, the first path is better with 16 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eat (4,0), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6), then (7,1).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (7,1): 1 left, 5 down.\n\nTotal: 2 + (1+4) + 2 + 3 + (1 + 5) = 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 18 steps.\n\nStill more than 16.\n\nSo, the initial path seems best.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the other snake is at (1,6), and assuming it's moving towards one of the apples at y=6, I need to be cautious when moving up to higher y coordinates.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples at lower y coordinates first, before moving up.\n\nSo, eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nThat way, I'm staying lower on the board initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to eat (4,0), then move up to (5,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the positions more carefully.\n\nLet me try to plot this path step by step.\n\nStarting at (2,0):\n\n1. Right to (3,0)\n\n2. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nNow, my tail is at (2,0).\n\nNext moves:\n\n3. Up to (4,1)\n\n4. Right to (5,1)\n\n5. Up to (5,2)\n\n6. Up to (5,3)\n\n7. Right to (6,3)\n\nWait, this seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Up to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2)\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. My snake is number 2, currently at position (1,0). There are apples at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (2,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, myself, or the other snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. At the bottom row, y=0: there's an apple at (4,0), and I'm at (1,0). At y=1, there's an apple at (7,1). At y=4, there's an apple at (5,4). At y=6, there are apples at (5,6) and (8,6).\n\nSo, the apples are spread out vertically and horizontally. I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple to minimize the moves and time spent. The closest apple is at (4,0), which is straight to the right from my current position at (1,0). It's only three steps to the right.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. Will growing make it harder for me to maneuver? Also, I need to consider the position of the other snake and plan to avoid it.\n\nThe other snake is at (2,6), which is up and to the right from my position. If I go for the apple at (4,0), I'll be moving to the right, away from the other snake initially.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,0), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves.\n\nStarting at (1,0):\n\n1.

From the board, it seems clear, but I need to confirm.\n\nAlso, I need to keep an eye on the other snake's position. If it's moving down towards me, I need to adjust my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (5,4) next, which is up and to the right.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (5,4) from (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nComparing that to going to (7,1), which is four moves from (4,0).\n\nSo, going to (7,1) is quicker.\n\nAfter eating (7,1), I can then aim for (5,4), which is two left and three up from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves in total from (7,1) to (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could go to (8,1), then (8,2), and so on to (8,6), but that seems farther.\n\nI think the initial plan is better: (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

There are apples at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (3,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, myself, or the other snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. At the bottom row, y=0: there's an apple at (4,0), and I'm at (0,0). At y=1, there's an apple at (7,1). At y=4, there's an apple at (5,4). At y=6, there are apples at (5,6) and (8,6).\n\nSo, the apples are spread out vertically and horizontally. I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple to minimize the moves and time spent. The closest apple is at (4,0), which is straight to the right from my current position at (0,0). It's four steps to the right.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. Will growing make it harder for me to maneuver? Also, I need to consider the position of the other snake and plan to avoid it.\n\nThe other snake is at (3,6), which is up and to the right from my position. If I go for the apple at (4,0), I'll be moving to the right, away from the other snake initially.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,0), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. Right to (1,0)\n\n2. Right to (2,0)\n\n3. Right to (3,0)\n\n4. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nNow, from (4,0), I can look for the next apple. The closest one would be (7,1), which is three steps right and one step up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.

From the board, it seems clear, but I need to confirm.\n\nAlso, I need to keep an eye on the other snake's position. If it's moving down towards me, I need to adjust my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (5,4) next, which is up and to the right.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (5,4) from (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nComparing that to going to (7,1), which is four moves from (4,0).\n\nSo, going to (7,1) is quicker.\n\nAfter eating (7,1), I can then aim for (5,4), which is two left and three up from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves in total from (7,1) to (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could go to (8,1), then (8,2), and so on to (8,6), but that seems farther.\n\nI think the initial plan is better: (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

Move up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\n9. Move left to (6,1)\n\n10. Move left to (5,1)\n\n11. Move up to (5,2)\n\n12. Move up to (5,3)\n\n13. Move up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\n14. Move up to (5,5)\n\n15. Move up to (5,6) - eat apple\n\n16. Move right to (6,6)\n\n17. Move right to (7,6)\n\n18. Move right to (8,6) - eat apple\n\nThat seems like a lot of moves, but it should cover all the apples.\n\nI need to make sure that the path is clear and that the other snake doesn't block my way.\n\nLet's think about the other snake's possible movements.\n\nIt's at (4,6), and it might try to go for (5,6) or (8,6).\n\nIf I can eat (5,6) before it does, that would be ideal.\n\nBut to get to (5,6), I need to go through (5,4), which is another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should prioritize eating (5,4) earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (8,6) first, but that's farther away.\n\nWait, let's consider the distances.\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- to (4,0): 3 right\n\n- to (7,1): 6 right, 1 up\n\n- to (5,4): 4 right, 4 up\n\n- to (5,6): 4 right, 6 up\n\n- to (8,6): 7 right, 6 up\n\nIf I go for (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6), that seems logical.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Right to (6,0)\n\n- Right to (7,0)\n\n- Up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nThen from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThen from (5,4):\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Up to (5,6) - eat apple\n\nThen from (5,6):\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6) - eat apple\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nNow, regarding the other snake at (4,6). If I can eat (5,6) before it gets there, that would be great.\n\nAlternatively, if it's trying to get to (8,6), I might need to race it there.\n\nBut for now, I'll stick with my initial plan.\n\nSo, my immediate goal is to move to (4,0).\n\nFrom (1,0), I need to move right three times.\n\nLet me confirm the path:\n\n- (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (4,0)\n\nLooks clear.\n\nAfter eating (4,0), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nProbably to (7,1), as it's the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (4,0), move right to (5,0), right to (6,0), right to (7,0), up to (7,1).\n\nThen proceed to (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nI should also keep an eye on the other snake's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nFor now, my first move should be to the right, towards (2,0).\n\nSo, I'll choose to move right.\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). The apples are located at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (1,6) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (2,0), which is on the bottom row, third cell from the left. There's an apple at (4,0), which is two cells to the right of me. Another apple at (7,1), which is a bit diagonally up and to the right. Then there's (5,4), which is up and to the right as well. (5,6) is higher up, and (8,6) is even further to the right.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Going for the closest one might be best to maximize points quickly. The apple at (4,0) is right next to me, only two moves away. But I should consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, there's another snake at (1,6), which is up and to the left. Since its body is empty, it's probably just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into walls or myself. Since I'm at (2,0), moving left would take me to (1,0), and then to (0,0), but I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\n1. Go right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. Alternatively, move up to (2,1), then to (2,2), and so on, to reach other apples.\n\nBut option 1 seems quicker for getting the first apple.\n\nWait, but if I go right to (3,0), then to (4,0), I'll eat the apple at (4,0). After that, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me see the distance to other apples from there.\n\nFrom (4,0), the apple at (7,1) is three right and up one.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is up four and right one.\n\n(5,6) is up six and right one.\n\n(8,6) is up six and right four.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (7,1) next would be logical, since it's closer.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. If it's at (1,6), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or direction.\n\nMaybe I should try to predict its movement. If it's trying to get to an apple, it might go for the one at (5,6) or (8,6), which are both at y=6.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting as many apples as possible without worrying too much about the other snake for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to block the other snake's path to certain apples, but that might be risky.\n\nFor now, I think the best approach is to get the closest apples first and try to maximize my score before worrying about the other snake.\n\nSo, starting by going right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can decide to move up to (4,1), then to (4,2), and so on, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can move up to (4,1), then right to (5,1), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better plan is to move right to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then to (4,1), and then to (5,1), aiming for the apple at (7,1).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should just go straight up from (4,0) towards (4,1), (4,2), and so on.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the order in which to eat the apples to minimize the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at all the apple positions:\n\n(4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), (7,1)\n\nStarting from (2,0), closest is (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nSo, a possible path is (2,0) -> (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 steps right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (7,1): 3 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (5,4): 2 steps left, 3 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 steps right.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + (3+1) + (2+3) + 2 + 3 = 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16 steps.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Maybe if I go to (7,1) directly from (2,0).\n\nLet's see: from (2,0) to (7,1): 5 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nBut I need to go through (4,0) first to eat that apple.\n\nWait, but if I go directly to (7,1), I can eat that apple and then go to (4,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, no. If I go to (7,1) first, then to (4,0), that would be:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,1): 5 right, 1 up.\n\nThen from (7,1) to (4,0): 3 left, 1 down.\n\nTotal: 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10 steps.\n\nThen from (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nThen to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nThen to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nTotal: 10 + (1 + 4) + 2 + 3 = 10 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 20 steps.\n\nWait, that's more than the previous path.\n\nSo, the first path is better with 16 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eat (4,0), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6), then (7,1).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (7,1): 1 left, 5 down.\n\nTotal: 2 + (1+4) + 2 + 3 + (1 + 5) = 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 18 steps.\n\nStill more than 16.\n\nSo, the initial path seems best.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the other snake is at (1,6), and assuming it's moving towards one of the apples at y=6, I need to be cautious when moving up to higher y coordinates.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples at lower y coordinates first, before moving up.\n\nSo, eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nThat way, I'm staying lower on the board initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to eat (4,0), then move up to (5,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the positions more carefully.\n\nLet me try to plot this path step by step.\n\nStarting at (2,0):\n\n1. Right to (3,0)\n\n2. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nNow, my tail is at (2,0).\n\nNext moves:\n\n3. Up to (4,1)\n\n4. Right to (5,1)\n\n5. Up to (5,2)\n\n6. Up to (5,3)\n\n7. Right to (6,3)\n\nWait, this seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Up to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2)\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)"

There are apples at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1).

At the bottom row, y=0: there's an apple at (4,0), and I'm at (1,0). At y=1, there's an apple at (7,1). At y=4, there's an apple at (5,4). At y=6, there are apples at (5,6) and (8,6).\n\nSo, the apples are spread out vertically and horizontally.

Will growing make it harder for me to maneuver? Also, I need to consider the position of the other snake and plan to avoid it.\n\nThe other snake is at (2,6), which is up and to the right from my position. If I go for the apple at (4,0), I'll be moving to the right, away from the other snake initially.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,0), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves.\n\nStarting at (1,0):\n\n1.

From the board, it seems clear, but I need to confirm.\n\nAlso, I need to keep an eye on the other snake's position. If it's moving down towards me, I need to adjust my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (5,4) next, which is up and to the right.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (5,4) from (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nComparing that to going to (7,1), which is four moves from (4,0).\n\nSo, going to (7,1) is quicker.\n\nAfter eating (7,1), I can then aim for (5,4), which is two left and three up from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves in total from (7,1) to (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could go to (8,1), then (8,2), and so on to (8,6), but that seems farther.\n\nI think the initial plan is better: (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

From (5,6) to (8,6): 3 rights\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 17 moves.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nAlso, considering the other snake is at (2,6), and assuming it's moving down towards me, I need to be careful when I'm moving up.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the lower apples first and then moving up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to eat the apple at (5,4) directly after (4,0), instead of (7,1).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (5,4) to (7,1):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Down to (7,3)\n\n- Down to (7,2)\n\n- Down to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nThat's five more moves.\n\nTotal: 3 (to (4,0)) + 5 + 5 = 13 moves.\n\nWait, that seems better than the previous plan.\n\nBut actually, in the previous plan, it was 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 moves to get to (5,4) via (7,1), but in this plan, it's 3 + 5 + 5 = 13 moves.\n\nSo, the first plan is better in terms of moves.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the risk of running into the other snake.\n\nIf I move up to higher y coordinates, I might encounter the other snake.\n\nMaybe it's safer to stay lower on the board for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to eat the apple at (7,1) first, then (5,4), then (5,6), and so on.\n\nLet me think about the positions of the apples and the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (2,6), and if it's trying to get to the apples at y=6, it might be moving towards (5,6) or (8,6).\n\nIf I can stay away from y=6 until the other snake has eaten one of those apples, maybe I can sneak in and get the other one.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to eat the apples at y=6 first before the other snake can get to them.\n\nBut that might be risky.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's better to focus on the lower apples first.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1.

At y=6, there are apples at (5,6) and (8,6).\n\nSo, the apples are spread out vertically and horizontally. I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple to minimize the moves and time spent. The closest apple is at (4,0), which is straight to the right from my current position at (0,0). It's four steps to the right.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. Will growing make it harder for me to maneuver? Also, I need to consider the position of the other snake and plan to avoid it.\n\nThe other snake is at (3,6), which is up and to the right from my position. If I go for the apple at (4,0), I'll be moving to the right, away from the other snake initially.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,0), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. Right to (1,0)\n\n2. Right to (2,0)\n\n3. Right to (3,0)\n\n4. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nNow, from (4,0), I can look for the next apple. The closest one would be (7,1), which is three steps right and one step up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear. Let's see:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Right to (6,0)\n\n- Right to (7,0)\n\n- Up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nBut wait, at (7,0), is there any obstacle? From the board, it seems clear, but I need to confirm.\n\nAlso, I need to keep an eye on the other snake's position. If it's moving down towards me, I need to adjust my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (5,4) next, which is up and to the right.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (5,4) from (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nComparing that to going to (7,1), which is four moves from (4,0).\n\nSo, going to (7,1) is quicker.\n\nAfter eating (7,1), I can then aim for (5,4), which is two left and three up from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves in total from (7,1) to (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could go to (8,1), then (8,2), and so on to (8,6), but that seems farther.\n\nI think the initial plan is better: (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. From (0,0) to (4,0): 4 rights\n\n2. From (4,0) to (7,1): 3 rights, 1 up\n\n3. From (7,1) to (5,4): 2 lefts, 3 ups\n\n4. From (5,4) to (5,6): 2 ups\n\n5. From (5,6) to (8,6): 3 rights\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 18 moves.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nAlso, considering the other snake is at (3,6), and assuming it's moving down towards me, I need to be careful when I'm moving up.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the lower apples first and then moving up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to eat the apple at (5,4) directly after (4,0), instead of (7,1).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Up to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (5,4) to (7,1):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Down to (7,3)\n\n- Down to (7,2)\n\n- Down to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nThat's five more moves.\n\nTotal: 4 (to (4,0)) + 5 + 5 = 14 moves.\n\nWait, that seems better than the previous plan.\n\nBut actually, in the previous plan, it was 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 moves to get to (5,4) via (7,1), but in this plan, it's 4 + 5 + 5 = 14 moves.\n\nSo, the first plan is better in terms of moves.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the risk of running into the other snake.\n\nIf I move up to higher y coordinates, I might encounter the other snake.\n\nMaybe it's safer to stay lower on the board for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to eat the apple at (7,1) first, then (5,4), then (5,6), and so on.\n\nLet me think about the positions of the apples and the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (3,6), and if it's trying to get to the apples at y=6, it might be moving towards (5,6) or (8,6).\n\nIf I can stay away from y=6 until the other snake has eaten one of those apples, maybe I can sneak in and get the other one.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to eat the apples at y=6 first before the other snake can get to them.\n\nBut that might be risky.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's better to focus on the lower apples first.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Eat the apple at (4,0)\n\n2. Then eat the apple at (7,1)\n\n3. Then eat the apple at (5,4)\n\n4. Then eat the apple at (5,6)\n\n5. Finally, eat the apple at (8,6)\n\nLet me think about the moves again.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n- Right to (1,0)\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so I need to be careful not to turn back onto my tail.\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Up to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\n- Right to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nNow, my snake has grown again.\n\nFrom (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Up to (5,6) - eat apple\n\nFrom (5,6):\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6) - eat apple\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 18 moves.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into the other snake.\n\nLet me consider the other snake's possible movements.\n\nAssuming the other snake at (3,6) is also trying to eat the apples at y=6, it might move towards (5,6) or (8,6"

Let's think about the path to the next apple.\n\nFrom (4,0), I can move right to (5,0), then (6,0), (7,0), and up to (7,1).\n\nThen from (7,1), I can move left to (5,1), up to (5,4), then to (5,6), and finally to (8,6).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake, which is at (4,6).\n\nLet me think about the other snake's possible moves. Since it's snake 1, and it's at (4,6), it might be trying to go for the apples at (5,6) or (8,6).\n\nIf I can eat the lower apples first, like (4,0) and (7,1), before going up to higher y coordinates, I might be able to avoid confrontation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for (5,4) after (4,0), then (5,6), and so on.\n\nLet me try to plan a path:\n\n1. Start at (1,0)\n\n2. Move right to (2,0)\n\n3. Move right to (3,0)\n\n4. Move right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\n5. Move right to (5,0)\n\n6. Move right to (6,0)\n\n7. Move right to (7,0)\n\n8. Move up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\n9. Move left to (6,1)\n\n10. Move left to (5,1)\n\n11. Move up to (5,2)\n\n12. Move up to (5,3)\n\n13. Move up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\n14. Move up to (5,5)\n\n15. Move up to (5,6) - eat apple\n\n16. Move right to (6,6)\n\n17. Move right to (7,6)\n\n18. Move right to (8,6) - eat apple\n\nThat seems like a lot of moves, but it should cover all the apples.\n\nI need to make sure that the path is clear and that the other snake doesn't block my way.\n\nLet's think about the other snake's possible movements.\n\nIt's at (4,6), and it might try to go for (5,6) or (8,6).\n\nIf I can eat (5,6) before it does, that would be ideal.\n\nBut to get to (5,6), I need to go through (5,4), which is another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should prioritize eating (5,4) earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (8,6) first, but that's farther away.\n\nWait, let's consider the distances.\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- to (4,0): 3 right\n\n- to (7,1): 6 right, 1 up\n\n- to (5,4): 4 right, 4 up\n\n- to (5,6): 4 right, 6 up\n\n- to (8,6): 7 right, 6 up\n\nIf I go for (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6), that seems logical.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Right to (6,0)\n\n- Right to (7,0)\n\n- Up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nThen from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\nThen from (5,4):\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Up to (5,6) - eat apple\n\nThen from (5,6):\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6) - eat apple\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nNow, regarding the other snake at (4,6). If I can eat (5,6) before it gets there, that would be great.\n\nAlternatively, if it's trying to get to (8,6), I might need to race it there.\n\nBut for now, I'll stick with my initial plan.\n\nSo, my immediate goal is to move to (4,0).\n\nFrom (1,0), I need to move right three times.\n\nLet me confirm the path:\n\n- (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (4,0)\n\nLooks clear.\n\nAfter eating (4,0), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nProbably to (7,1), as it's the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (4,0), move right to (5,0), right to (6,0), right to (7,0), up to (7,1).\n\nThen proceed to (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nI should also keep an eye on the other snake's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nFor now, my first move should be to the right, towards (2,0).\n\nSo, I'll choose to move right.\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**Current State:**\n\n- Snake 2 is at (2,0)\n\n- Apples remain at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), (7,1)\n\n- Enemy snake 1 is at (4,6)\n\n**Your Move:**\n\nI need to decide my next move. I previously moved right from (1,0) to (2,0), and my plan is to continue moving right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nCurrently, the board shows:\n\nRow 0: . 2 . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . 1 A . . A .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (2,0), moving right to (3,0) should be safe. There are no snakes or walls in that direction.\n\nAfter reaching (4,0), I'll eat the apple and grow in length. Then, I'll proceed to (7,1), which is the next closest apple.\n\nI need to make sure that while moving to (7,1), I don't run into snake 1, which is at (4,6). If snake 1 moves down to (4,5), then to (4,4), it might intercept my path if I go up to (5,4). So, I need to be cautious.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating (7,1) before going up to higher y coordinates.\n\nLet me think about the path again:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Right to (6,0)\n\n- Right to (7,0)\n\n- Up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nThen, from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Up to (5,6) - eat apple\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6) - eat apple\n\nThis seems"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,0). The apples are located at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (1,6) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (2,0), which is on the bottom row, third cell from the left. There's an apple at (4,0), which is two cells to the right of me. Another apple at (7,1), which is a bit diagonally up and to the right. Then there's (5,4), which is up and to the right as well. (5,6) is higher up, and (8,6) is even further to the right.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Going for the closest one might be best to maximize points quickly. The apple at (4,0) is right next to me, only two moves away. But I should consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, there's another snake at (1,6), which is up and to the left. Since its body is empty, it's probably just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, I need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into walls or myself. Since I'm at (2,0), moving left would take me to (1,0), and then to (0,0), but I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\n1. Go right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\n2. Alternatively, move up to (2,1), then to (2,2), and so on, to reach other apples.\n\nBut option 1 seems quicker for getting the first apple.\n\nWait, but if I go right to (3,0), then to (4,0), I'll eat the apple at (4,0). After that, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me see the distance to other apples from there.\n\nFrom (4,0), the apple at (7,1) is three right and up one.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is up four and right one.\n\n(5,6) is up six and right one.\n\n(8,6) is up six and right four.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (7,1) next would be logical, since it's closer.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. If it's at (1,6), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or direction.\n\nMaybe I should try to predict its movement. If it's trying to get to an apple, it might go for the one at (5,6) or (8,6), which are both at y=6.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting as many apples as possible without worrying too much about the other snake for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to block the other snake's path to certain apples, but that might be risky.\n\nFor now, I think the best approach is to get the closest apples first and try to maximize my score before worrying about the other snake.\n\nSo, starting by going right to (3,0), then to (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (2,0).\n\nThen, I can decide to move up to (4,1), then to (4,2), and so on, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can move up to (4,1), then right to (5,1), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better plan is to move right to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then to (4,1), and then to (5,1), aiming for the apple at (7,1).\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I should just go straight up from (4,0) towards (4,1), (4,2), and so on.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the order in which to eat the apples to minimize the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at all the apple positions:\n\n(4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), (7,1)\n\nStarting from (2,0), closest is (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nSo, a possible path is (2,0) -> (4,0) -> (7,1) -> (5,4) -> (5,6) -> (8,6).\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 steps right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (7,1): 3 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (5,4): 2 steps left, 3 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 steps up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 steps right.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + (3+1) + (2+3) + 2 + 3 = 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16 steps.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Maybe if I go to (7,1) directly from (2,0).\n\nLet's see: from (2,0) to (7,1): 5 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nBut I need to go through (4,0) first to eat that apple.\n\nWait, but if I go directly to (7,1), I can eat that apple and then go to (4,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, no. If I go to (7,1) first, then to (4,0), that would be:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,1): 5 right, 1 up.\n\nThen from (7,1) to (4,0): 3 left, 1 down.\n\nTotal: 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10 steps.\n\nThen from (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nThen to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nThen to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nTotal: 10 + (1 + 4) + 2 + 3 = 10 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 20 steps.\n\nWait, that's more than the previous path.\n\nSo, the first path is better with 16 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eat (4,0), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6), then (7,1).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (4,0): 2 right.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,4): 1 right, 4 up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,6): 2 up.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (8,6): 3 right.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (7,1): 1 left, 5 down.\n\nTotal: 2 + (1+4) + 2 + 3 + (1 + 5) = 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 18 steps.\n\nStill more than 16.\n\nSo, the initial path seems best.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or myself.\n\nGiven that the other snake is at (1,6), and assuming it's moving towards one of the apples at y=6, I need to be cautious when moving up to higher y coordinates.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples at lower y coordinates first, before moving up.\n\nSo, eat (4,0), then (7,1), then (5,4), then (5,6), then (8,6).\n\nThat way, I'm staying lower on the board initially.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to eat (4,0), then move up to (5,0), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the positions more carefully.\n\nLet me try to plot this path step by step.\n\nStarting at (2,0):\n\n1. Right to (3,0)\n\n2. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nNow, my tail is at (2,0).\n\nNext moves:\n\n3. Up to (4,1)\n\n4. Right to (5,1)\n\n5. Up to (5,2)\n\n6. Up to (5,3)\n\n7. Right to (6,3)\n\nWait, this seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Up to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\n- Up to (6,2)\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. My snake is number 2, currently at position (1,0). There are apples at (4,0), (8,6), (5,4), (5,6), and (7,1). There's also another snake, number 1, at (2,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat as many apples as possible without hitting walls, myself, or the other snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. At the bottom row, y=0: there's an apple at (4,0), and I'm at (1,0). At y=1, there's an apple at (7,1). At y=4, there's an apple at (5,4). At y=6, there are apples at (5,6) and (8,6).\n\nSo, the apples are spread out vertically and horizontally. I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple to minimize the moves and time spent. The closest apple is at (4,0), which is straight to the right from my current position at (1,0). It's only three steps to the right.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple. Will growing make it harder for me to maneuver? Also, I need to consider the position of the other snake and plan to avoid it.\n\nThe other snake is at (2,6), which is up and to the right from my position. If I go for the apple at (4,0), I'll be moving to the right, away from the other snake initially.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,0), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves.\n\nStarting at (1,0):\n\n1. Right to (2,0)\n\n2. Right to (3,0)\n\n3. Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nNow, from (4,0), I can look for the next apple. The closest one would be (7,1), which is three steps right and one step up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear. Let's see:\n\nFrom (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Right to (6,0)\n\n- Right to (7,0)\n\n- Up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nBut wait, at (7,0), is there any obstacle? From the board, it seems clear, but I need to confirm.\n\nAlso, I need to keep an eye on the other snake's position.

At the bottom row, y=0: there's an apple at (4,0), and I'm at (0,0). At y=1, there's an apple at (7,1). At y=4, there's an apple at (5,4).

According to the board, I'm at (1,0), not (3,1) as initially stated. Maybe there was a confusion in coordinates.\n\nAssuming (0,0) is bottom-left, increasing y goes up.\n\nSo, from (1,0), I can move right to (2,0), then (3,0), (4,0) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating (4,0), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next. The closest ones would be (5,4) or (7,1).\n\nBut (7,1) is further up the board, and enemy snake 1 is at (5,4). I need to consider its movement.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (5,4), with its body at (5,5). It might be trying to reach apples above it.\n\nI should try to eat apples in an order that allows me to grow faster and block the enemy's path if possible.\n\nLet me consider a sequence:\n\n1. Eat (4,0)\n\n2. Move towards (7,1)\n\n3. Then to (5,4)\n\n4. Then to (5,6)\n\n5. Finally to (8,6)\n\nThis seems logical, as it progresses from lower to higher y coordinates, potentially staying away from the enemy initially.\n\nFrom (1,0):\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go after eating (4,0). The closest apples are (5,4) and (7,1).\n\nLet's look at the distances:\n\n- To (7,1): 3 right and 1 up from (4,0)\n\n- To (5,4): 1 right and 4 up from (4,0)\n\nSo, (7,1) is closer in terms of total moves (4 moves vs. 5 moves).\n\nBut, (5,4) is where the enemy is located. It might be better to go for (7,1) first to avoid confrontation.\n\nSo, from (4,0):\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Right to (6,0)\n\n- Right to (7,0)\n\n- Up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\nThen, from (7,1):\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3)\n\n- Up to (5,4) - eat apple\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Up to (5,6) - eat apple\n\n- Right to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6) - eat apple\n\nThis seems a logical path, but I need to consider the enemy's movements.\n\nEnemy is at (5,4), and its body is at (5,5). It might be trying to go upwards or sidewards.\n\nIf I can eat (5,4) before the enemy reaches it, that would be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,1) first, the enemy might move towards (5,6) or (8,6).\n\nI need to predict the enemy's movements based on its current position and possible strategies.\n\nAssuming the enemy is also trying to eat apples, it might go for the nearest one, which could be (5,6).\n\nSo, if I eat (5,4) first, I might block its path to (5,6).\n\nBut to get to (5,4), I need to go through (5,1) to (5,4), which is a vertical move.\n\nHowever, to reach (5,1) from (7,1), I need to move left to (5,1), which is feasible.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to eat (7,1) first to secure that apple and then proceed to (5,4).\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nAnother approach could be to eat (4,0), then move up to (4,1), then right to (5,1), up to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut that might take more moves and put me closer to the enemy sooner.\n\nI think going to (7,1) first is better, as it allows me to cover more ground and potentially avoid the enemy.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. From (1,0):\n\n- Right to (2,0)\n\n- Right to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,0) - eat apple\n\n- Right to (5,0)\n\n- Right to (6,0)\n\n- Right to (7,0)\n\n- Up to (7,1) - eat apple\n\n2.
