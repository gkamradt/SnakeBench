This move takes you directly to the apple at (2, 5), allowing you to gain a point. It\u2019s also a safe move as it doesn\u2019t bring you closer to the enemy snake.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nAfter moving RIGHT and eating the apple at (2, 5), consider moving towards the next closest apple, such as (3, 1) or (4, 1).
