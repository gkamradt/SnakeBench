My current position is (8, 0), and there are several apples within reach.\n\nLooking at the positions of the other snakes, I can see that Snake #1 is at (2, 9) with its body at (2, 8), and Snake #3 is at (4, 8) with its body at (3, 8). These snakes are positioned in a way that could potentially block my movement or put me at risk if I'm not careful.\n\nThe apple at (10, 1) is the closest to my current position, so moving DOWN would allow me to reach it. However, I need to be mindful of the other snakes and avoid getting too close to them.\n\nMoving LEFT would put me in closer proximity to Snake #1, which could be risky. Moving RIGHT would take me away from the other snakes, but it would also move me farther from the closest apple.\n\nConsidering the overall board state and the positions of the other snakes, I believe the safest option is to move DOWN. This will allow me to collect the apple at (10, 1) while keeping me relatively far from the other snakes. In the next turn, I may choose to move RIGHT or UP, depending on the positions of the apples and the other snakes.\n\nMy next move: DOWN."

            "rationale": "Looking at our current head at (4,8), let\u2019s quickly survey our immediate options. We cannot go LEFT since that would be reversing into the space we just left. That leaves us with UP to (4,9), RIGHT to (5,8), and DOWN to (4,7).\n\nIf we step UP to (4,9) we\u2019re moving toward the board\u2019s top. There is an apple at (11,9), but that\u2019s still a few moves away and puts us closer to enemy snake #1 (whose head is at (2,9)). Going DOWN takes us toward the lower part of the board, which might eventually lead us to apples like (7,4) or (5,3), but it might also force extra turns to balance our x and y coordinates.\n\nOn the other hand, moving RIGHT to (5,8) increases our x coordinate and brings us closer to the apple at (7,4) and even the apple at (5,3) (by narrowing the gap on the x\u2011axis). From (5,8) we\u2019ll still have plenty of room to adjust our path safely without approaching the enemy snakes too quickly. Plus, it keeps an open route forward.\n\nThus, our strategy for this turn is to head RIGHT, gradually moving toward the cluster of apples while staying clear of enemy zones.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
