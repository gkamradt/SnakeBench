Since you just moved DOWN and now need to make another move, let\u2019s evaluate the new state:\n\n- You are currently at (4, 2)\u2014you\u2019ve consumed an apple and thus moved downward.\n- The next closest apple after the one at (3, 1) is the ones at (2,6), (2,7), or increasing Y from current position up.\n- The enemy snake at (7, 4) is not a direct threat at the moment and there are no other snakes currently visible besides Snake #1 and yourself.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Move:\n1. **Point Gathering**: Go towards the closest apples. Now that the closest apple is at (3, 3).\n2. **Avoiding Obstacles**: Ensure you don\u2019t move into a wall or towards the enemy snake.\n3. **Prolonging Survival**: Continue to head towards safer zones on the board, avoiding immediate threats and keeping an eye on the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\nPossible moves from (4, 2):\n1. **RIGHT**: Not helpful since it does not lead directly to the nearest apple.\n2. **DOWN**: Out of bounds (below the board).\n3. **UP**: Towards the apple at (3, 3), immediate apple gain.\n4. **LEFT**: Might be moving in the path to reach apples at (2, 6), and (2, 7).\n\nGiven these considerations, moving UP or LEFT both seems good for the next positions:\n1. **UP**: Move towards the apple at (3, 3).\n2. **LEFT**: Will position the snake to potentially other apples at (2, 6), and (2, 7).\n\nTrying to keep near apple leads:\n**Current**:\n\t* Building up to next position.\n\nFor now, the strategy will be to move UP to the nearest apple.
