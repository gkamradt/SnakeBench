(5, 6)\n\n### Closest Apples:\n- The apple at (1, 1) is directly below me, three steps away.\n- The apple at (6, 1) requires more steps but seems less contested initially.\n\n### Opponent Snake:\n- Snake #2 is at (1, 8), currently not in immediate threat range but is near the apple at (0, 8).\n\n### Strategy & Moves:\n- **Move towards the closest apple at (1, 1):** This requires me to go DOWN three times.\n  \n  Since I'm starting from (1, 4), I need to move:\n  - DOWN to (1, 3)\n  - DOWN to (1, 2)\n  - DOWN to (1, 1) to eat the apple.\n\n1. **Safety Check**: Moving DOWN is safe for now since there's no immediate obstacle and it doesn't involve moving towards another snake.\n  \n2. **Commit to Route**: I'll start by moving DOWN. The single apple at (1, 1) is relatively uncontested and accessible within three moves.\n\n### Future Strategy:\n- After collecting the apple at (1, 1), I need to consider another direction, possibly towards the apple at (6, 1), given there are no immediate snakes or walls in that direction. However, I should reassess on the next turn based on the opponents' moves.\n\n### Decided Move:\n- **Next Move: DOWN**"
