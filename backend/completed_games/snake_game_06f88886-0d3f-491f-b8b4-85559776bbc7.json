However, moving left positions the snake near the left edge with no immediate apples nearby, potentially limiting options for point collection in the near future.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (2, 9):**\n   - **Reversing Direction:** Moving right would reverse the snake's last move (LEFT), which could lead to a collision with itself if the game enforces non-reversing movement rules.\n\n4. **DOWN to (1, 8):**\n   - **Apple Present:** No.\n   - **Safety:** The space at (1, 8) is open.
