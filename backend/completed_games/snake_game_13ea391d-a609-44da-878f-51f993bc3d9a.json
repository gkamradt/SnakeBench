Securing this apple will provide nourishment and increase my size, which could also increase my strategic options in upcoming turns.\n- Enemy Snake #2 at (5, 7) does not pose an immediate threat to reaching my target, as it is significantly far in the vertical direction and has no body parts that could hinder my path.\n- After consuming the apple at (5, 2), the next course of action would be to consider the apples at (7, 2) and (7, 7). The best choice among these will depend on my updated position and the enemy's maneuvers in the next turn.\n\nNext Round Strategy:\n- Depending on the position and potential movement of enemy Snake #2, I need to strategize whether to head towards apple (7, 2) directly or to orient towards the center of the board to possibly contest for apple (7, 7) while maintaining flexibility in movement.\n\nDecided Next Move: RIGHT\nThis will bring me to the position (5, 2) to consume the apple."

This strategy is directed towards approaching the other apples, especially (7, 7), which positions me in the center and provides competitive advantage over more apples or strategic control of the board.\n\n- However, considering immediate obstacles is crucial. After eating the apple at (5, 2), continuing UP without changing horizontal position positions me towards (7, 7), albeit indirectly.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**\n\nThis will allow me to consume the apple at (5, 2) and subsequently consider the best path toward either the apple at (7, 2) or heading further north for more strategic positioning."
