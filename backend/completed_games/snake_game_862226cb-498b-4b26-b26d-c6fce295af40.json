However, we must also consider the long-term strategy and the positions of the other apples.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (4, 9), moving left to (2, 9) and then down to (2, 2) to collect the next apple is a good plan. However, we should also be aware of the apple at (6, 7), which is in the vicinity of Snake #2. It would be beneficial to position ourselves to collect this apple after (2, 2), without getting too close to Snake #2.\n\nTherefore, after collecting the apple at (4, 9), instead of moving all the way to (2, 9), we should consider moving to (4, 8) or (5, 8) to be in a better position to collect the apple at (6, 7) after visiting (2, 2). This would also keep us at a safe distance from Snake #2, which is currently at (5, 8).\n\nWith this strategy in mind, the next move should be: UP to collect the apple at (4, 9).\n\nFor the subsequent move after collecting the apple at (4, 9), we should evaluate the position of Snake #2 again and decide whether to move left towards (2, 9) or right towards (5, 8) to position ourselves for the next apples at (2, 2) and (6, 7), while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #2.\n\nNext turn strategy: After collecting the apple at (4, 9), assess the position of Snake #2 to determine whether to move left or right, with the aim of collecting the apple at (2, 2) next and then positioning for the apple at (6, 7) while avoiding Snake #2.\n\nNext move: UP"

Since Snake #2 is at (4, 8), moving left towards (2, 9) would be risky as it would bring us closer to Snake #2's trajectory. Instead, it would be safer and more strategic to move towards the right side of the board to position for the apple at (6, 7) after collecting the one at (2, 2).\n\nTo do this, we should move right to (5, 9) or (6, 9), which would allow us to turn down towards (2, 2) after ensuring that Snake #2 is not in the vicinity of (6, 7).
