Moving right allows me to collect this apple immediately, increasing my score by 1.\n     - **Proximity to Another Apple:** After collecting the apple at **(5, 8)**, I'll be closer to the apple at **(8, 8)**, facilitating quicker access in subsequent moves.\n     - **Open Path Forward:** The space to the right remains open, providing flexibility for future maneuvers.\n\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Potential Tail Collision:** Need to ensure that moving right doesn't lead to a collision with my own tail. However, since collecting an apple will extend my length, the tail will adjust accordingly, mitigating this risk.\n\n2. **UP to (4, 9):**\n   \n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Open Space:** Moving upwards opens up more space, reducing the risk of getting trapped.\n   \n   - **Cons:**\n     - **No Immediate Apple:** This move doesn't allow me to collect an apple on this turn.\n     - **Distance from Apples:** Moving up takes me away from the nearest apples, potentially slowing down score accumulation.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n   \n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Alternative Pathways:** Moving left could open up pathways towards other apples, such as the one at **(2, 4)**.\n   \n   - **Cons:**\n     - **No Immediate Apples:** There's no apple in this direction, which could hinder quick scoring.\n     - **Proximity to Enemy Snake:** Need to be cautious of the enemy snake's position to avoid potential collisions in future moves.\n\n4. **DOWN to (4, 7):**\n   \n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Retreating Safely:** Moving down moves me away from crowded areas, potentially avoiding immediate threats.\n   \n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Risk of Collision with Tail:** Moving down into **(4, 7)** may result in a collision with my own tail, especially if the tail hasn't moved forward yet.\n     - **Moving Away from Apples:** This move takes me further from the nearest apples, reducing scoring opportunities.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nMy primary objective is to maximize apple collection while minimizing the risk of collisions. Moving **RIGHT** to **(5, 8)** offers the best immediate advantage by allowing me to collect an apple and positioning me closer to another one. Additionally, the path forward remains open, providing ample opportunities for maneuvering in subsequent turns.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

Moving right allows me to collect this apple immediately, increasing my score by 1.\n     - **Proximity to Another Apple:** After collecting the apple at **(5, 8)**, I'll be closer to the apple at **(8, 8)**, facilitating quicker access in subsequent moves.\n     - **Open Path Forward:** The space to the right remains open, providing flexibility for future maneuvers.\n\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Potential Tail Collision:** Need to ensure that moving right doesn't lead to a collision with my own tail. However, since collecting an apple will extend my length, the tail will adjust accordingly, mitigating this risk.\n\n2. **UP to (4, 9):**\n   \n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Open Space:** Moving upwards opens up more space, reducing the risk of getting trapped.\n   \n   - **Cons:**\n     - **No Immediate Apple:** This move doesn't allow me to collect an apple on this turn.\n     - **Distance from Apples:** Moving up takes me away from the nearest apples, potentially slowing down score accumulation.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n   \n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Alternative Pathways:** Moving left could open up pathways towards other apples, such as the one at **(2, 4)**.\n   \n   - **Cons:**\n     - **No Immediate Apples:** There's no apple in this direction, which could hinder quick scoring.\n     - **Proximity to Enemy Snake:** Need to be cautious of the enemy snake's position to avoid potential collisions in future moves.\n\n4. **DOWN to (4, 7):**\n   \n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Retreating Safely:** Moving down moves me away from crowded areas, potentially avoiding immediate threats.\n   \n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Risk of Collision with Tail:** Moving down into **(4, 7)** may result in a collision with my own tail, especially if the tail hasn't moved forward yet.\n     - **Moving Away from Apples:** This move takes me further from the nearest apples, reducing scoring opportunities.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nMy primary objective is to maximize apple collection while minimizing the risk of collisions. Moving **RIGHT** to **(5, 8)** offers the best immediate advantage by allowing me to collect an apple and positioning me closer to another one. Additionally, the path forward remains open, providing ample opportunities for maneuvering in subsequent turns.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"
