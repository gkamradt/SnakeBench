After consuming that apple, I will reassess my options for the next apple.\n\nAt this point, I have successfully collected the apple at (8, 1) without colliding with Snake #1. Now, I need to decide which apple to go for next. I have two viable options: the apple at (6, 9) or the apple at (9, 4).\n\nThe apple at (6, 9) is closer, but going for it would mean moving towards Snake #1, which could be risky. On the other hand, the apple at (9, 4) is further away, but it might be safer to get since I can go around Snake #1.\n\nConsidering the potential risk of moving towards Snake #1, I believe it would be wiser to go for the apple at (9, 4). Although it is further away, it reduces the chance of a collision with Snake #1.\n\nStrategy: Focus on safely navigating towards the apple at (9, 4) while avoiding Snake #1.\n\nNext move: RIGHT. This move will take me closer to the apple at (9, 4) while avoiding Snake #1."

I'll need to move left to get there.\n\nHowever, I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's movement. It's currently at (0, 0) with its body at (1, 0), so it's not an immediate threat. But I should be prepared to adjust my strategy if it starts moving towards me.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving left towards the apple at (0, 7) while keeping an eye on Snake #2's movement.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "Thinking out loud: After moving LEFT again, my new position would be (-1, 0). This is not a valid position since the coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9). I should avoid moving up for now since that would take me even closer to the edge. Moving down would take me away from the apple at (0, 7), so that's not an ideal option either. I can still move left to get closer to the apple, but I need to be cautious about Snake #1's position.\n\nCurrent situation: I'm one step away from the apple at (0, 7) and two steps away from the edge of the board. Snake #1 is at position (4, 6) with its body at [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. I'm three steps away from Snake #1's head and two steps away from its body.\n\nConsidering the board edge and Snake #1's position, I will move down to get away from the edge while ensuring I don't get too close to Snake #1's body.\n\nNext move: DOWN.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving down, I'll be one step closer to the apple at (0, 7) and further away from the edge. I should then consider moving left to get even closer to the apple while keeping an eye on Snake #1's position."
