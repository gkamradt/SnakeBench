            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,1). There are apples at (9,5), (2,1), (9,4), (3,7), and (8,7). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (3,1), which is somewhere near the bottom. There's an apple at (2,1), which is directly left of me, and another at (3,7), which is above me.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apple at (2,1) is right next to me, so it's the closest. But if I eat that one, I'll grow, which might make it harder to maneuver. Also, there's another snake on the board, so I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nLet me look at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . A\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A 2 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, from this, I can see that:\n\n- At (9,4): A\n\n- At (9,5): 1 (enemy snake head)\n\n- At (8,7): A\n\n- At (3,7): A\n\n- At (2,1): A\n\n- At (3,1): 2 (my head)\n\n- At (3,9): 1 (enemy snake head)\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 9 has a 1 at column 4, which should be (9,4), but it's listed as A in the apples list. Maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (9,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (8,7)\n\nBut in the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nThis would be columns 0 to 9:\n\n0: . 1: . 2: . 3: . 4: 1 5: . 6: . 7: . 8: . 9: . .\n\nSo, (9,4) is 1, which is the enemy snake head. But apples are at (9,4) and (9,5). Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the board state or the apple positions.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 has three apples:\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . A\n\nSo, columns 3 and 9 have apples.\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nRow 7:\n\n0: . 1: . 2: . 3: A 4: . 5: . 6: . 7: . 8: . 9: A\n\nSo, (7,3) and (7,9) have apples, but according to the list, apples are at (3,7), which should be row 7, column 3. So that matches.\n\nSimilarly, (8,7) should be row 7, column 8, which is not marked as A in the board state. Wait, row 7 only has A at columns 3 and 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the board state is not fully updated, or there's a mismatch between the list and the board state.\n\nAnyway, I need to proceed with the information given.\n\nMy position is (3,1), and I need to decide which apple to go for.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (2,1), which is directly left of me.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's the closest apple; I can eat it immediately by moving left.\n\n- Minimal movement required.\n\nCons:\n\n- After eating it, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nOption 2: Aim for a different apple, maybe (3,7), which is above me.\n\nPros:\n\n- Avoids immediate growth, maybe giving me more flexibility.\n\nCons:\n\n- It's farther away; I need to navigate upwards, watching out for the enemy snake at (3,9).\n\nWait, but (3,9) is the enemy snake's head. If I go upwards to (3,7), I need to make sure the enemy isn't coming down towards me.\n\nBut the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other apples and plan a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- (2,1): immediate left\n\n- (3,7): above\n\n- (9,4): top-right, but that's where the enemy is.\n\n- (9,5): top-right, near the enemy.\n\n- (8,7): above and to the right.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (3,9), and assuming it will try to protect its area, maybe I should avoid going up too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for the apple at (2,1), grow, and then position myself to go after another apple.\n\nLet me consider the board boundaries. The grid is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nIf I move left from (3,1) to (2,1), I need to make sure that my tail doesn't cause me to hit it.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, my tail grows, so my previous position remains part of my body.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my head moves to (2,1), and my previous position (3,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, next move, I need to make sure not to move back to (3,1).\n\nWait, but in snake games, you can't usually move backwards immediately, as your head would collide with your own body.\n\nBut in this variant, it seems like you can move in any direction except directly back, depending on the implementation.\n\nI need to be careful not to move into my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closest apple is the safest option for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to position myself to cut off the enemy snake or something, but that might be too aggressive for the first move.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to aim for the apple at (3,7), which is above me, while keeping an eye on the enemy.\n\nBut to get to (3,7) from (3,1), I need to move up 6 rows, to y=7.\n\nThat's a long way up, and with the enemy at (3,9), I need to be careful not to\u649e\u4e0a\u5b83\u3002\n\nMaybe I should consider moving diagonally or sideways to avoid direct confrontation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for the apple at (2,1), grow, and then decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me consider the immediate move.\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), I eat the apple, grow, and my body now occupies (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nThen, on the next move, I need to choose between moving up to (2,2), down to (2,0), or left to (1,1).\n\nBut moving left to (1,1) might be another step towards the apple at (3,7), but it's not directly upwards.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,2) would be towards (3,7).\n\nWait, but I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the Manhattan distance to each apple and prioritize accordingly.\n\nThe Manhattan distance from (3,1) to each apple:\n\n- (2,1): distance = |3-2| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (3,7): |3-3| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (9,4): |3-9| + |1-4| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (9,5): |3-9| + |1-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (8,7): |3-8| + |1-7| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the closest apple is (2,1), followed by (3,7), then the rest.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for (2,"

So, position (x,y) corresponds to column x, row y.\n\nGiven that, my head is at (3,1), which is column 3, row 1.\n\nOkay, that makes sense now.\n\nNow, there are apples at:\n\n- (9,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (8,7)\n\nAnd there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,9), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nAlright, so I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the distances:\n\nFrom (3,1):\n\n- To (2,1): distance of 1 (left)\n\n- To (3,7): distance of 6 (up)\n\n- To (9,4): distance of 6 in x and 3 in y, so total of 9\n\n- To (9,5): distance of 6 in x and 4 in y, so total of 10\n\n- To (8,7): distance of 5 in x and 6 in y, so total of 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,1), just to the left of me.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (3,9). If I go for the apple at (2,1), I'll be moving left, which might not put me in direct conflict with the enemy, at least not immediately.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (2,1), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail afterward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can aim for the apple at (3,7), which is directly above me, but it's farther away, and the enemy is also above me at (3,9). I need to be careful not to run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (3,9), which is higher up in the Y direction. If I go up towards (3,7), I'll be moving closer to the enemy, which might not be ideal.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (2,1) first, since it's closest, and then decide my next move based on where the enemy goes.\n\nAlso, considering that when I eat an apple, I grow, which could make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces. But in this open board, that might not be a big issue yet.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,1) to eat the apple there.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's the closest apple.\n\n- Quick point gain.\n\nCons:\n\n- I'll grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\n- Not sure if the enemy is moving.\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,7).\n\nPros:\n\n- Avoids immediate growth.\n\n- Might be able to position myself for better access to other apples.\n\nCons:\n\n- Farther distance.\n\n- Enemy is above me, potential for conflict.\n\nOption 3: Move right towards (4,1).\n\nPros:\n\n- Moves away from the enemy.\n\n- Doesn't immediately eat an apple, so no growth yet.\n\nCons:\n\n- No immediate point gain.\n\n- Further from any apple.\n\nHmm, maybe moving left to eat the closest apple is the way to go for now.\n\nLet me consider the board again.\n\nAt (3,1), I can move:\n\n- Left to (2,1): eat apple, grow\n\n- Up to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), I eat the apple, grow, and my tail will extend. So, my new head is at (2,1), and my previous position (3,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, on the next move, I need to make sure not to move back to (3,1), as that's now part of my body.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (3,2), I don't eat any apple, and I'm moving towards (3,7).\n\nBut (3,2) isn't particularly strategic; it's just one step up.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (3,0) might not be useful, as there are no apples down there, and it might limit my options.\n\nMoving right to (4,1) also doesn't seem particularly helpful, as it moves me away from the closest apple and doesn't bring me closer to any other apples immediately.\n\nSo, again, moving left to (2,1) seems like the best option for now.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,1), I'll be at (2,1), and my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, I can:\n\n- Move left to (1,1)\n\n- Move up to (2,2)\n\n- Move down to (2,0)\n\n- Move right back to (3,1), but that's now my tail, which I can't collide with.\n\nSo, I can't move right back to (3,1).\n\nTherefore, I need to choose between left, up, or down.\n\nAt that point, I need to consider which direction takes me closer to another apple without putting me in harm's way.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (3,7) is above me, at (2,2) would be moving towards it.\n\n- (9,4) is top-right.\n\n- (9,5) is top-right.\n\n- (8,7) is also top-right.\n\nSo, moving up seems like it could lead me towards multiple apples.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (2,1), moving up to (2,2) would be a good next step.\n\nThen, I can continue moving up towards (3,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't blocking my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (3,9), and assuming it stays put or moves in a certain direction, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nHowever, since this is a turn-based game, and I don't know the enemy's movement yet, I'll have to assume it might move towards me or away from me.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps moving left to (1,1) after eating the apple at (2,1) could be a safer option, allowing me to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut then I'd be moving away from the cluster of apples at higher Y positions.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan: move left to eat the closest apple, then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (3,9), which is at the top-middle of the board.\n\nI'm at (3,1), directly below the enemy.\n\nIf I move up towards (3,2), I'm moving closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (2,1), I'm moving sideways, away from the enemy somewhat.\n\nBut the enemy could potentially move down towards me.\n\nIn snake games, often the best strategy is to try to control the center or key positions on the board.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim to control the central area, maybe moving towards (5,5) or something like that, but that's not immediately obvious.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are multiple apples clustered at higher Y positions, like (9,5), (9,4), (8,7),"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,1). There are apples at (9,5), (2,1), (9,4), (3,7), and (8,7). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (3,1), which is somewhere near the bottom. There's an apple at (2,1), which is directly left of me, and another at (3,7), which is above me.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apple at (2,1) is right next to me, so it's the closest. But if I eat that one, I'll grow, which might make it harder to maneuver. Also, there's another snake on the board, so I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nLet me look at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . A\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A 2 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, from this, I can see that:\n\n- At (9,4): A\n\n- At (9,5): 1 (enemy snake head)\n\n- At (8,7): A\n\n- At (3,7): A\n\n- At (2,1): A\n\n- At (3,1): 2 (my head)\n\n- At (3,9): 1 (enemy snake head)\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 9 has a 1 at column 4, which should be (9,4), but it's listed as A in the apples list. Maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (9,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (8,7)\n\nBut in the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nThis would be columns 0 to 9:\n\n0: . 1: . 2: . 3: . 4: 1 5: . 6: . 7: . 8: . 9: . .\n\nSo, (9,4) is 1, which is the enemy snake head. But apples are at (9,4) and (9,5). Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the board state or the apple positions.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 has three apples:\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . A\n\nSo, columns 3 and 9 have apples.\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nRow 7:\n\n0: . 1: . 2: . 3: A 4: . 5: . 6: . 7: . 8: . 9: A\n\nSo, (7,3) and (7,9) have apples, but according to the list, apples are at (3,7), which should be row 7, column 3. So that matches.\n\nSimilarly, (8,7) should be row 7, column 8, which is not marked as A in the board state. Wait, row 7 only has A at columns 3 and 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the board state is not fully updated, or there's a mismatch between the list and the board state.\n\nAnyway, I need to proceed with the information given.\n\nMy position is (3,1), and I need to decide which apple to go for.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (2,1), which is directly left of me.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's the closest apple; I can eat it immediately by moving left.\n\n- Minimal movement required.\n\nCons:\n\n- After eating it, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nOption 2: Aim for a different apple, maybe (3,7), which is above me.\n\nPros:\n\n- Avoids immediate growth, maybe giving me more flexibility.\n\nCons:\n\n- It's farther away; I need to navigate upwards, watching out for the enemy snake at (3,9).\n\nWait, but (3,9) is the enemy snake's head. If I go upwards to (3,7), I need to make sure the enemy isn't coming down towards me.\n\nBut the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other apples and plan a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- (2,1): immediate left\n\n- (3,7): above\n\n- (9,4): top-right, but that's where the enemy is.\n\n- (9,5): top-right, near the enemy.\n\n- (8,7): above and to the right.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (3,9), and assuming it will try to protect its area, maybe I should avoid going up too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for the apple at (2,1), grow, and then position myself to go after another apple.\n\nLet me consider the board boundaries. The grid is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nIf I move left from (3,1) to (2,1), I need to make sure that my tail doesn't cause me to hit it.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, my tail grows, so my previous position remains part of my body.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my head moves to (2,1), and my previous position (3,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, next move, I need to make sure not to move back to (3,1).\n\nWait, but in snake games, you can't usually move backwards immediately, as your head would collide with your own body.\n\nBut in this variant, it seems like you can move in any direction except directly back, depending on the implementation.\n\nI need to be careful not to move into my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closest apple is the safest option for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to position myself to cut off the enemy snake or something, but that might be too aggressive for the first move.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to aim for the apple at (3,7), which is above me, while keeping an eye on the enemy.\n\nBut to get to (3,7) from (3,1), I need to move up 6 rows, to y=7.\n\nThat's a long way up, and with the enemy at (3,9), I need to be careful not to\u649e\u4e0a\u5b83\u3002\n\nMaybe I should consider moving diagonally or sideways to avoid direct confrontation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for the apple at (2,1), grow, and then decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me consider the immediate move.\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), I eat the apple, grow, and my body now occupies (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nThen, on the next move, I need to choose between moving up to (2,2), down to (2,0), or left to (1,1).\n\nBut moving left to (1,1) might be another step towards the apple at (3,7), but it's not directly upwards.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,2) would be towards (3,7).\n\nWait, but I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the Manhattan distance to each apple and prioritize accordingly.\n\nThe Manhattan distance from (3,1) to each apple:\n\n- (2,1): distance = |3-2| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (3,7): |3-3| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (9,4): |3-9| + |1-4| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (9,5): |3-9| + |1-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (8,7): |3-8| + |1-7| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the closest apple is (2,1), followed by (3,7), then the rest.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for (2,"

Let me check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . A\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A 2 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, at row 1, column 3, there's a 2, which is me. So, my head is at (3,1). But in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,2). Hmm, maybe there's a mix-up in row and column ordering. I need to clarify this.\n\nAssuming that the board state has rows listed from 0 to 9, with row 0 at the bottom, and columns from 0 to 9. So, position (x,y) corresponds to column x, row y.\n\nGiven that, my head is at (3,1), which is column 3, row 1.\n\nOkay, that makes sense now.\n\nNow, there are apples at:\n\n- (9,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (8,7)\n\nAnd there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,9), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nAlright, so I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the distances:\n\nFrom (3,1):\n\n- To (2,1): distance of 1 (left)\n\n- To (3,7): distance of 6 (up)\n\n- To (9,4): distance of 6 in x and 3 in y, so total of 9\n\n- To (9,5): distance of 6 in x and 4 in y, so total of 10\n\n- To (8,7): distance of 5 in x and 6 in y, so total of 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,1), just to the left of me.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (3,9). If I go for the apple at (2,1), I'll be moving left, which might not put me in direct conflict with the enemy, at least not immediately.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (2,1), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail afterward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can aim for the apple at (3,7), which is directly above me, but it's farther away, and the enemy is also above me at (3,9). I need to be careful not to run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (3,9), which is higher up in the Y direction. If I go up towards (3,7), I'll be moving closer to the enemy, which might not be ideal.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (2,1) first, since it's closest, and then decide my next move based on where the enemy goes.\n\nAlso, considering that when I eat an apple, I grow, which could make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces. But in this open board, that might not be a big issue yet.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,1) to eat the apple there.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's the closest apple.\n\n- Quick point gain.\n\nCons:\n\n- I'll grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\n- Not sure if the enemy is moving.\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,7).\n\nPros:\n\n- Avoids immediate growth.\n\n- Might be able to position myself for better access to other apples.\n\nCons:\n\n- Farther distance.\n\n- Enemy is above me, potential for conflict.\n\nOption 3: Move right towards (4,1).\n\nPros:\n\n- Moves away from the enemy.\n\n- Doesn't immediately eat an apple, so no growth yet.\n\nCons:\n\n- No immediate point gain.\n\n- Further from any apple.\n\nHmm, maybe moving left to eat the closest apple is the way to go for now.\n\nLet me consider the board again.\n\nAt (3,1), I can move:\n\n- Left to (2,1): eat apple, grow\n\n- Up to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), I eat the apple, grow, and my tail will extend. So, my new head is at (2,1), and my previous position (3,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, on the next move, I need to make sure not to move back to (3,1), as that's now part of my body.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (3,2), I don't eat any apple, and I'm moving towards (3,7).\n\nBut (3,2) isn't particularly strategic; it's just one step up.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (3,0) might not be useful, as there are no apples down there, and it might limit my options.\n\nMoving right to (4,1) also doesn't seem particularly helpful, as it moves me away from the closest apple and doesn't bring me closer to any other apples immediately.\n\nSo, again, moving left to (2,1) seems like the best option for now.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,1), I'll be at (2,1), and my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, I can:\n\n- Move left to (1,1)\n\n- Move up to (2,2)\n\n- Move down to (2,0)\n\n- Move right back to (3,1), but that's now my tail, which I can't collide with.\n\nSo, I can't move right back to (3,1).\n\nTherefore, I need to choose between left, up, or down.\n\nAt that point, I need to consider which direction takes me closer to another apple without putting me in harm's way.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (3,7) is above me, at (2,2) would be moving towards it.\n\n- (9,4) is top-right.\n\n- (9,5) is top-right.\n\n- (8,7) is also top-right.\n\nSo, moving up seems like it could lead me towards multiple apples.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (2,1), moving up to (2,2) would be a good next step.\n\nThen, I can continue moving up towards (3,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't blocking my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (3,9), and assuming it stays put or moves in a certain direction, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nHowever, since this is a turn-based game, and I don't know the enemy's movement yet, I'll have to assume it might move towards me or away from me.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps moving left to (1,1) after eating the apple at (2,1) could be a safer option, allowing me to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut then I'd be moving away from the cluster of apples at higher Y positions.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan: move left to eat the closest apple, then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (3,9), which is at the top-middle of the board.\n\nI'm at (3,1), directly below the enemy.\n\nIf I move up towards (3,2), I'm moving closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (2,1), I'm moving sideways, away from the enemy somewhat.\n\nBut the enemy could potentially move down towards me.\n\nIn snake games, often the best strategy is to try to control the center or key positions on the board.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim to control the central area, maybe moving towards (5,5) or something like that, but that's not immediately obvious.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are multiple apples clustered at higher Y positions, like (9,5), (9,4), (8,7),"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,1). There are apples at (9,5), (2,1), (9,4), (3,7), and (8,7). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position is (3,1), which is somewhere near the bottom. There's an apple at (2,1), which is directly left of me, and another at (3,7), which is above me.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apple at (2,1) is right next to me, so it's the closest. But if I eat that one, I'll grow, which might make it harder to maneuver. Also, there's another snake on the board, so I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nLet me look at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . A\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A 2 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, from this, I can see that:\n\n- At (9,4): A\n\n- At (9,5): 1 (enemy snake head)\n\n- At (8,7): A\n\n- At (3,7): A\n\n- At (2,1): A\n\n- At (3,1): 2 (my head)\n\n- At (3,9): 1 (enemy snake head)\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 9 has a 1 at column 4, which should be (9,4), but it's listed as A in the apples list. Maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (9,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (8,7)\n\nBut in the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nThis would be columns 0 to 9:\n\n0: . 1: . 2: . 3: . 4: 1 5: . 6: . 7: . 8: . 9: . .\n\nSo, (9,4) is 1, which is the enemy snake head. But apples are at (9,4) and (9,5). Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the board state or the apple positions.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 has three apples:\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . A\n\nSo, columns 3 and 9 have apples.\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nRow 7:\n\n0: . 1: . 2: . 3: A 4: . 5: . 6: . 7: . 8: . 9: A\n\nSo, (7,3) and (7,9) have apples, but according to the list, apples are at (3,7), which should be row 7, column 3. So that matches.\n\nSimilarly, (8,7) should be row 7, column 8, which is not marked as A in the board state. Wait, row 7 only has A at columns 3 and 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the board state is not fully updated, or there's a mismatch between the list and the board state.\n\nAnyway, I need to proceed with the information given.\n\nMy position is (3,1), and I need to decide which apple to go for.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (2,1), which is directly left of me.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's the closest apple; I can eat it immediately by moving left.\n\n- Minimal movement required.\n\nCons:\n\n- After eating it, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nOption 2: Aim for a different apple, maybe (3,7), which is above me.\n\nPros:\n\n- Avoids immediate growth, maybe giving me more flexibility.\n\nCons:\n\n- It's farther away; I need to navigate upwards, watching out for the enemy snake at (3,9).\n\nWait, but (3,9) is the enemy snake's head. If I go upwards to (3,7), I need to make sure the enemy isn't coming down towards me.\n\nBut the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other apples and plan a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- (2,1): immediate left\n\n- (3,7): above\n\n- (9,4): top-right, but that's where the enemy is.\n\n- (9,5): top-right, near the enemy.\n\n- (8,7): above and to the right.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (3,9), and assuming it will try to protect its area, maybe I should avoid going up too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for the apple at (2,1), grow, and then position myself to go after another apple.\n\nLet me consider the board boundaries. The grid is 10x10, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nIf I move left from (3,1) to (2,1), I need to make sure that my tail doesn't cause me to hit it.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, my tail grows, so my previous position remains part of my body.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my head moves to (2,1), and my previous position (3,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, next move, I need to make sure not to move back to (3,1).\n\nWait, but in snake games, you can't usually move backwards immediately, as your head would collide with your own body.\n\nBut in this variant, it seems like you can move in any direction except directly back, depending on the implementation.\n\nI need to be careful not to move into my own body or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closest apple is the safest option for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to position myself to cut off the enemy snake or something, but that might be too aggressive for the first move.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to aim for the apple at (3,7), which is above me, while keeping an eye on the enemy.\n\nBut to get to (3,7) from (3,1), I need to move up 6 rows, to y=7.\n\nThat's a long way up, and with the enemy at (3,9), I need to be careful not to\u649e\u4e0a\u5b83\u3002\n\nMaybe I should consider moving diagonally or sideways to avoid direct confrontation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for the apple at (2,1), grow, and then decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me consider the immediate move.\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), I eat the apple, grow, and my body now occupies (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nThen, on the next move, I need to choose between moving up to (2,2), down to (2,0), or left to (1,1).\n\nBut moving left to (1,1) might be another step towards the apple at (3,7), but it's not directly upwards.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,2) would be towards (3,7).\n\nWait, but I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the Manhattan distance to each apple and prioritize accordingly.\n\nThe Manhattan distance from (3,1) to each apple:\n\n- (2,1): distance = |3-2| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (3,7): |3-3| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (9,4): |3-9| + |1-4| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- (9,5): |3-9| + |1-5| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- (8,7): |3-8| + |1-7| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the closest apple is (2,1), followed by (3,7), then the rest.\n\nGiven that, it makes sense to go for (2,"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, which is a bit counterintuitive for me, but I'll have to keep that in mind.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,1). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,2), but in the board state, it's shown at (3,1). There might be a confusion here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . A\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A 2 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, at row 1, column 3, there's a 2, which is me. So, my head is at (3,1). But in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,2). Hmm, maybe there's a mix-up in row and column ordering. I need to clarify this.\n\nAssuming that the board state has rows listed from 0 to 9, with row 0 at the bottom, and columns from 0 to 9. So, position (x,y) corresponds to column x, row y.\n\nGiven that, my head is at (3,1), which is column 3, row 1.\n\nOkay, that makes sense now.\n\nNow, there are apples at:\n\n- (9,5)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (8,7)\n\nAnd there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,9), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nAlright, so I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the distances:\n\nFrom (3,1):\n\n- To (2,1): distance of 1 (left)\n\n- To (3,7): distance of 6 (up)\n\n- To (9,4): distance of 6 in x and 3 in y, so total of 9\n\n- To (9,5): distance of 6 in x and 4 in y, so total of 10\n\n- To (8,7): distance of 5 in x and 6 in y, so total of 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,1), just to the left of me.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (3,9). If I go for the apple at (2,1), I'll be moving left, which might not put me in direct conflict with the enemy, at least not immediately.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (2,1), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail afterward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can aim for the apple at (3,7), which is directly above me, but it's farther away, and the enemy is also above me at (3,9). I need to be careful not to run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (3,9), which is higher up in the Y direction. If I go up towards (3,7), I'll be moving closer to the enemy, which might not be ideal.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (2,1) first, since it's closest, and then decide my next move based on where the enemy goes.\n\nAlso, considering that when I eat an apple, I grow, which could make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces. But in this open board, that might not be a big issue yet.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,1) to eat the apple there.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's the closest apple.\n\n- Quick point gain.\n\nCons:\n\n- I'll grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\n- Not sure if the enemy is moving.\n\nOption 2: Move up towards (3,7).\n\nPros:\n\n- Avoids immediate growth.\n\n- Might be able to position myself for better access to other apples.\n\nCons:\n\n- Farther distance.\n\n- Enemy is above me, potential for conflict.\n\nOption 3: Move right towards (4,1).\n\nPros:\n\n- Moves away from the enemy.\n\n- Doesn't immediately eat an apple, so no growth yet.\n\nCons:\n\n- No immediate point gain.\n\n- Further from any apple.\n\nHmm, maybe moving left to eat the closest apple is the way to go for now.\n\nLet me consider the board again.\n\nAt (3,1), I can move:\n\n- Left to (2,1): eat apple, grow\n\n- Up to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,0)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), I eat the apple, grow, and my tail will extend. So, my new head is at (2,1), and my previous position (3,1) becomes part of my body.\n\nThen, on the next move, I need to make sure not to move back to (3,1), as that's now part of my body.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (3,2), I don't eat any apple, and I'm moving towards (3,7).\n\nBut (3,2) isn't particularly strategic; it's just one step up.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (3,0) might not be useful, as there are no apples down there, and it might limit my options.\n\nMoving right to (4,1) also doesn't seem particularly helpful, as it moves me away from the closest apple and doesn't bring me closer to any other apples immediately.\n\nSo, again, moving left to (2,1) seems like the best option for now.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,1), I'll be at (2,1), and my tail will be at (3,1).\n\nThen, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, I can:\n\n- Move left to (1,1)\n\n- Move up to (2,2)\n\n- Move down to (2,0)\n\n- Move right back to (3,1), but that's now my tail, which I can't collide with.\n\nSo, I can't move right back to (3,1).\n\nTherefore, I need to choose between left, up, or down.\n\nAt that point, I need to consider which direction takes me closer to another apple without putting me in harm's way.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (3,7) is above me, at (2,2) would be moving towards it.\n\n- (9,4) is top-right.\n\n- (9,5) is top-right.\n\n- (8,7) is also top-right.\n\nSo, moving up seems like it could lead me towards multiple apples.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (2,1), moving up to (2,2) would be a good next step.\n\nThen, I can continue moving up towards (3,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't blocking my path.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (3,9), and assuming it stays put or moves in a certain direction, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nHowever, since this is a turn-based game, and I don't know the enemy's movement yet, I'll have to assume it might move towards me or away from me.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps moving left to (1,1) after eating the apple at (2,1) could be a safer option, allowing me to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut then I'd be moving away from the cluster of apples at higher Y positions.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should just stick to the initial plan: move left to eat the closest apple, then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (3,9), which is at the top-middle of the board.\n\nI'm at (3,1), directly below the enemy.\n\nIf I move up towards (3,2), I'm moving closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (2,1), I'm moving sideways, away from the enemy somewhat.\n\nBut the enemy could potentially move down towards me.\n\nIn snake games, often the best strategy is to try to control the center or key positions on the board.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should aim to control the central area, maybe moving towards (5,5) or something like that, but that's not immediately obvious.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are multiple apples clustered at higher Y positions, like (9,5), (9,4), (8,7),"
