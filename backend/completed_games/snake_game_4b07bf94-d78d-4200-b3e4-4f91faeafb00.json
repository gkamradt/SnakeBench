Therefore, it might be a good idea to continue moving RIGHT towards the apple at (7, 7) while maintaining some distance from the enemy snake and keeping an eye on its movements.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards the apple at (7, 7) while monitoring the enemy snake's movements.
