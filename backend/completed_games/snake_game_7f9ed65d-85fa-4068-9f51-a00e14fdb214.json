The apple at (3, 6) seems to be the safest bet as it's relatively close and collecting it would not put me at immediate risk of running into Snake #1 or the walls.\n\nHowever, before making any long-term plans, I need to ensure my immediate safety and collect the apple below me. Snake #1 is currently not in a position to threaten me directly, but I must remain vigilant of its movements.\n\nTherefore, my next move is:\n\nNext move: DOWN to collect the apple at (8, 5).\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I will reassess the situation. If Snake #1 continues to move horizontally or downwards, I will aim for the apple at (3, 6). If Snake #1 starts moving upwards, I may need to reconsider and potentially go for the apple at (2, 3) or find a safe path to the apple at (6, 0). My strategy will be flexible and based on the movements of Snake #1 and the apples' positions.\n\nEnd of response. Next move: DOWN."

Therefore, I should avoid moving down for now.\n\nThe next closest apple is at (8, 5), which is a safer target since it doesn't put me in immediate danger of a collision with Snake #1.

This will start my journey towards the apple at (8, 5) without any immediate risks.\n\nTherefore, the next move is: RIGHT.\n\nFor the next turn, I should continue to monitor Snake #1's position and adjust my route to the apple at (8, 5) if necessary, while also looking out for opportunities to collect other apples that may become safer to reach based on the dynamic positions of the snakes and apples."

Before I do that, I need to ensure that Snake #1 is not going to move in a way that could cut off my path or collide with me. Since Snake #1's head is at (2, 5), it has limited movement options and cannot immediately interfere with my planned path.\n\nTherefore, I will start moving down towards the apple at (8, 5), while keeping an eye on Snake #1's movements. If Snake #1 moves left or up, I will have a clear path to the apple. If it moves down, I may need to reconsider my strategy to avoid a collision.\n\nFor the next move, I will move down to position (8, 7), which is the first step towards collecting the apple at (8, 5). This move also keeps me at a safe distance from the enemy snake and the wall.\n\nNext move: DOWN to position (8, 7).\n\nFor the next turn, I should continue to monitor Snake #1's position and adjust my strategy accordingly to collect the apple and avoid a collision. If Snake #1 continues to move away from me, I can safely move down twice more to collect the apple. If Snake #1's movements become unpredictable or threatening, I may need to adjust my path to ensure safety."
