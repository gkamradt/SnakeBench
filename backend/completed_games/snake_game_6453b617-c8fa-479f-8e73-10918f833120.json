Snake #2 is at (4, 1) with no body.\n\nI just finished a move in the UP direction. Now, I want to make sure that the next move I make is a smart one that will keep me safe and also help me score points, either by growing through eating apples or out-maneuvering the competition for future scoring opportunities.\n\nPossible next moves:\n\n 1. UP: This would move me from (3, 8) to (3, 9). This move will not bring me closer to any apple and it's risky as it's getting closer to the top wall. Also, there's no guarantee I will have the opportunity to go back down and eat the apple at (4, 8).\n 2. DOWN: Moving down to (3, 7) would position me near the middle of the board. While it's not the best move to score points, it could provide a strategic advantage by giving more options and avoiding getting boxed in.\n 3. LEFT: Moving to the left to (2, 8) puts me near Snake #2. This move might not be the safest as getting head-to-head with the enemy (especially since Snake #2 has a body) could be risky. But it could be effective by blocking Snake #2 and potentially forcing it into a corner.\n 4. RIGHT: Moving to the right to (4, 8) would allow me to immediately reach an apple and gain a point. This would increase my size, giving me an advantage. It's a clear opportunity to score.\n\nGiven the available options, the best move right now is to head right to (4, 8). This will allow me to grow, as I will be immediately next to an apple, and increasing my size will provide several advantages in terms of survival and future moves.\n\nNext move suggested: RIGHT.\n\nI'll remember that if I successfully eat the apple, I'll need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid running into the walls or the other snake while adjusting to my increased size."

Snake #2 is at (4, 2) with body at [(4, 1)].\n\nI just finished a move in the RIGHT direction towards the apple at (4, 8).

DOWN: Moving to (4, 7) is still a useful move since it keeps me in the middle of the board, providing more options for future moves and avoiding getting boxed in.\n 3.

LEFT: Moving to the left to (2, 8) puts me near Snake #2. This move might not be the safest as getting head-to-head with the enemy (especially since Snake #2 has a body) could be risky.

Snake #2 is at (4, 1) with no body.\n\nI just finished a move in the UP direction. Now, I want to make sure that the next move I make is a smart one that will keep me safe and also help me score points, either by growing through eating apples or out-maneuvering the competition for future scoring opportunities.\n\nPossible next moves:\n\n 1. UP: This would move me from (3, 8) to (3, 9). This move will not bring me closer to any apple and it's risky as it's getting closer to the top wall. Also, there's no guarantee I will have the opportunity to go back down and eat the apple at (4, 8).\n 2. DOWN: Moving down to (3, 7) would position me near the middle of the board. While it's not the best move to score points, it could provide a strategic advantage by giving more options and avoiding getting boxed in.\n 3. LEFT: Moving to the left to (2, 8) puts me near Snake #2. This move might not be the safest as getting head-to-head with the enemy (especially since Snake #2 has a body) could be risky. But it could be effective by blocking Snake #2 and potentially forcing it into a corner.\n 4. RIGHT: Moving to the right to (4, 8) would allow me to immediately reach an apple and gain a point. This would increase my size, giving me an advantage. It's a clear opportunity to score.\n\nGiven the available options, the best move right now is to head right to (4, 8). This will allow me to grow, as I will be immediately next to an apple, and increasing my size will provide several advantages in terms of survival and future moves.\n\nNext move suggested: RIGHT.\n\nI'll remember that if I successfully eat the apple, I'll need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid running into the walls or the other snake while adjusting to my increased size."

Snake #2 is at (4, 2) with body at [(4, 1)].\n\nI just finished a move in the RIGHT direction towards the apple at (4, 8). Since I've successfully eaten the apple, my size has increased, and I now have to carefully consider my next move.\n\nConsiderations for next move:\n\n 1. UP: Moving forward to (4, 9) would not lead to an apple and would put me in the upper-right corner of the board, a potentially risky move given the proximity to the wall and less room for maneuver.\n 2. DOWN: Moving to (4, 7) is still a useful move since it keeps me in the middle of the board, providing more options for future moves and avoiding getting boxed in.\n 3. LEFT: Moving to (3, 8) might put me in a position where I need to navigate around Snake #2, which is not ideal given their head at (4, 2).\n 4. RIGHT: Since I am already at column 8, moving right (increasing the x-coordinate) is not possible as it would be out of bounds.\n\nGiven these options, the best choice is to move down to (4, 7). This move keeps me in the middle of the board, allows for maneuverability, and does not put me at an immediate risk of going out of bounds or running into the enemy.\n\nStrategy to tell myself next turn: Prioritize safety and position on the board while also considering proximity to apples. Be aware of the soon-to-be increasing size and need for more apples to continue growing.\n\nNext move: DOWN.\n\nFor the next turn, I will need to watch out for the position of Snake #2 and make sure not to box in. I will aim to strategically position myself near the remaining apples while keeping an eye on enemy movement."
