Moving in any other direction would not bring me closer to an apple and potentially closer to the enemy snake currently at position (4,5). By moving down, I'll be able to eat the apple and expand my length while also maintaining a safe distance from the other snake.\n\nI need to be cautious in following turns if the enemy snake moves down or to the left, which could potentially lead to our paths crossing.
