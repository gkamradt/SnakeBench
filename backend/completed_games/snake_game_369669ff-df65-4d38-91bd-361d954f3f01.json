Additionally, it strategically positions me closer to other apples, optimizing future moves for maximum point collection while maintaining safety from collisions.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 3), I'll reassess the board to identify the next closest apple, potentially at (4, 2) or (6, 4). I'll aim to create a clear path towards these apples while ensuring I maintain enough space to maneuver safely, avoiding walls and enemy snakes.
