I also see an apple at (4, 3) which is a bit farther away, but still within reach. I'll prioritize getting to the closer apple first.\n\nI'll also keep in mind that I need to avoid running into the enemy snake #2, which is at (5, 9). I don't want to get too close to it, so I'll try to stay away from that area for now.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the apple at (3, 2) and try to get as close as possible. I'll then reassess the situation and decide my next move.\n\nMy decided next move is: DOWN."

Moving directly towards it is not possible without hitting the wall or the enemy snake.\n3. **Avoid Enemy Snake**: The enemy snake is at (6, 0), which is not an immediate threat, but it's good to keep an eye on it.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Short-Term**: Move UP to avoid the wall and gain some vertical space.\n- **Long-Term**: Once you have more vertical space, you can start moving towards the apples, especially the one at (5, 3).\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the immediate need to avoid the wall, the best move is to go UP.\n\nNext move: UP"
