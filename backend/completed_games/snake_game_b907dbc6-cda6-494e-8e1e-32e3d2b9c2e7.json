It is unlikely to interfere with the apples we are considering.\n\n4. **Safe Movement Options**:\n   - **UP**: Moving up to (0, 4) allows me to immediately consume the apple at this location.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves me towards the apple at (1, 3) and could be a viable option once the apple at (0, 4) is consumed.\n   - **LEFT**: Not possible as I am at the left edge.\n   - **DOWN**: Would move me away from both apples and would not be advantageous.\n\n### Strategy and Decision\n\n- My immediate goal should be to collect the apple at (0, 4), as it is directly accessible with a single move. This allows me to maintain a strategic advantage by quickly scoring points.\n\n- **Future Consideration**: After collecting the apple at (0, 4), I should evaluate the situation again. Depending on what the board looks like, heading right towards (1, 3) could be a good next step, or pursuing another apple if it becomes more favorable.\n\n- For now, the safest and most strategic move is to proceed **UP**.
