Let's analyze the current board state again at this new position and determine my next best move.\n\n### Current Position:\n- My snake is now at (2, 5) with body segments at [(1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)] and is currently heading upwards.\n\n### Apples Nearby:\n- **(1, 6)** is reachable in one move by going UP to (2, 6).\n- **(2, 8)** is still far away.\n- **(8, 0)** and **(8, 3)**: Too far.\n- **(1, 2)**: Also too far.\n\n### Immediate Surrounding Analysis:\n1. **Up to (2, 6)**: This positions me directly next to (1, 6) and allows me to potentially take the apple on the next turn.\n2. **Down to (2, 4)**: This is where I just came from, so it's invalid.\n3. **Left to (1, 5)**: This position is free; however, it does not lead immediately to an apple.\n4. **Right to (3, 5)**: This position is also free and keeps my options open.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves:\n- The two best options are **UP to (2, 6)** or **LEFT to (1, 5)**.\n- Moving to **UP (2, 6)** positions me closer to (1, 6) and gets me one step nearer to potentially scoring points on my next turn.\n- Moving **LEFT to (1, 5)** keeps me safe, but there are no immediate advantages towards scoring. \n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n1. **UP to (2, 6)** allows me to access (1, 6) in my next turn, which would give me points, and it keeps advancing towards apples.\n2. The direct move UP seems more strategic since I can continue a forward motion that increases my chances of accessing more apples while incentivizing enemy snakes to react rather than just following my path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will choose to move **UP** to (2, 6). This move is vital for gaining an advantage by placing me right next to an apple on the following turn.\n\n### Next Move:\nUP"

This puts me right next to the apple located at (1, 6), which is just one move away to my left. \n\n### Immediate Surrounding Analysis:\n- **Up to (2, 7)**: This position is occupied by the enemy snake (Snake ID #1) at (2, 8), so I cannot go there.\n- **Down to (2, 5)**: This returns me to my previous position, which is not a viable option.\n- **Left to (1, 6)**: This is the apple location and allows me to gain points by moving here.\n- **Right to (3, 6)**: This position is free, but it doesn\u2019t lead me directly to an apple.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- **Going Left (1, 6)** clearly provides the immediate benefit of scoring points by eating the apple.\n- Meanwhile, the other options do not lead to immediate scoring opportunities and either move me backward or into a blocked position.\n\nGiven that I can score points by moving left, it is the optimal move here. \n\n### Next Move Strategy:\nFor the next turn, I will aim to remain focused on getting more apples and considering the movement of enemy snakes so that I maintain my position safely while trying to collect more points. \n\n### Conclusion:\nI will choose to move **LEFT** to (1, 6) to collect the apple.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nLEFT"
