Getting to (6, 9) would set a better angle to approach both apples in subsequent moves.\n\n**Movement Options and Safety:**\n- Moving UP is not an option as it leads to the boundary.\n- Moving LEFT would keep you at the same y-coordinate but wouldn't advance towards any nearby apples.\n- Moving DOWN allows you to start descending towards (6, 7) and (6, 8), but a potentially better initial move would be RIGHT, aiming to get to vertical alignment with these apples.\n\n**Obstacles to Consider:**\n- No immediate threats from Snake #2, as it is positioned far from your immediate vicinity.\n- The board's edges to the north limit upward movement, so planning to move in other directions is essential.\n\n**Future Strategic Considerations:**\n- By shifting RIGHT to (6, 9), you set a straight path downwards to collect the apples at (6, 7) and (6, 8), without any deviation needed, maximizing efficiency.\n- Ensure navigational options remain open after the next few moves, avoiding entrapment by the board's edges or other snakes.\n\n**Next Move:**\nMoving RIGHT to (6,9). This position places me directly aligned with the column of two apples below, offering the most direct route to them in the following turns.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
