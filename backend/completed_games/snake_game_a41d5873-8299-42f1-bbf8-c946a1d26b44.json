However, it's also moving towards the enemy snake #2 who might move downwards.\n  - Moving LEFT: This would move the snake to (3, 0). It would be a step towards moving up towards the apple at (3, 2) while offering a clearer path avoiding other snakes.\n  - Moving UP or DOWN: Since the board is 10x10 and my position is at the bottom (0,Y), moving DOWN is not an option as it will collide with the wall. Moving UP will take the snake towards (4, 1), putting it in a better position longitudinally for future turns, though not nearer to any apple on the next move.\n\n- Strategic Considerations:\n  - Collecting the apple at (5, 2) or at (3, 2) should be a priority for growth and points.\n  - It's beneficial to choose a move that keeps options open for future turns and keeps away from enemy paths as much as possible.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Moving UP looks like the safest and most strategic move right now. It keeps the snake away from the enemy snake, avoids immediate walls or self-collision threats, and aligns towards a vertical path where apples are visible for subsequent moves. \n\n**Decided Next Move:**\nMoving UP."

I'm not directly threatened by snake 1.  I should move up.  \n\nStrategy for next turn:  Continue moving up until I reach an apple or hit a wall.  If I hit a wall, I'll need to change direction.\n\nNext move: UP"
