Depending on the enemy snake's movement and potential new apples appearing, I might decide between moving RIGHT toward (8, 9) or navigating strategically to avoid any conflicts while looking to capture more apples.\n\n**Possible Next Move Thoughts:**\n- If I collect the apple at (7, 4), and considering the enemy snake's position, moving RIGHT to target the apple at (8, 9) should be considered while closely monitoring any enemy movement that might cut off this path.\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**\n\nThis move directly enables apple collection at (7, 4), contributing to the victory objectives and aiding our strategic growth on the board.

This will allow me gradual approach while maintaining options to either go DOWN or adjust my path based on new developments like enemy position or new apples. \n\n**Strategy Reminder for Next Turn:**\n- Continue assessing the enemy's movements particularly.

This will cause me to grow.\n- The nearest threats are not close enough to affect an immediate decision, and other apple positions on the board are generally far from my current location.\n\n**Possible Strategy for Current Move:**\n1. **Navigate to Additional Food Sources:** After consuming the apple at (7, 4), the next closest accessible apple from my current position is at (5, 2). To reach this apple from (7, 5), which will be my position after the growth, I would need to move LEFT first and then plan a path downwards.\n  \n2. **Avoid Conflicts:** The enemy snake's head is at (5, 9) which is far above my position. As long as I move within the lower half of the board, I should be safe from immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n3. **Plan for Future Growth:** Apples at (8, 9) and (9, 0) remain options for further growth after securing more immediate food sources. Depending on the enemy's movement, choosing a path towards these apples will need careful plotting to avoid any collisions or being cornered.\n\n**Immediate Next Steps:**\n- Since I will grow to occupy the apple spot at (7, 5) after consuming the apple at (7, 4), I should decide the best route to the next nearest apple at (5, 2). From (7, 5), the optimal direction to begin this journey would be LEFT. This decision is strictly towards enabling my path to future apples while minimizing risk from enemy contact.\n\n**Decided Next Move: LEFT**\n\nBy moving LEFT, I will start navigating my snake towards the next apple at (5, 2), keeping within the safer lower mid-range of the board. This will allow me gradual approach while maintaining options to either go DOWN or adjust my path based on new developments like enemy position or new apples. \n\n**Strategy Reminder for Next Turn:**\n- Continue assessing the enemy's movements particularly. If they start heading downward, consider shifting my route to potentially target different apples either by moving further DOWN or possibly changing direction to target the upper right apple at (8, 9) if safe passage becomes a possibility."

Assuming a RIGHT move was just made, location now is nominally at (9, 4).\n- **Immediate Options:** Directly being adjacent to the right wall on the board with x-coordinate 9, the immediate possibility of moving to the right is eliminated.\n- **Safety Assessment:** No immediate threats from snake #2 as it is located primarily in the top left, with considerable distance from my present location.\n- **Future Objective:** Both (8, 9) and (5, 2) apples are crucial future goals. The nearest apple (5, 2) requires navigating towards the left and downwards.\n\n**Decision-Making:**\n- **Moving UP** does not yield immediate strategic advantages, especially since it moves away from the nearest apple.\n- **Moving DOWN** from (9, 4) makes an initial approach towards the lower-lying apple at (5, 2) but keeps options open to easily adjust laterally due to being far from the wall on the bottom.\n- **Moving LEFT** to (8, 4) is also reasonable as it makes a direct approach towards the apple at (5, 2), aligning more closely with necessary lateral movement next, while avoiding any unnecessary vertical adjustments.\n\n**Selected Strategy:**\n- To secure the path towards the apple at (5, 2), as well as maintain operational flexibility in navigating the board safely while evading potential future threats from the enemy snake, the best strategic movement now is to start shifting leftward, balancing between approach to resource locations and avoiding walls along the top and right sides.\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**"
