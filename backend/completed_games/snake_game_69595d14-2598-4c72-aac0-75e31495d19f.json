            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, lower Y values are towards the bottom, and higher Y values are upwards. X increases to the right and decreases to the left.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: an apple at (0,7), which is the bottom-left corner of row 7.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: enemy snake 1 at (3,5).\n\nRow 4: apples at (4,4) and (5,4); snake 2 at (8,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: apple at (3,2).\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: apple at (6,0).\n\nOkay, so I'm at (8,4), which is towards the right side of row 4. There are apples at (4,4) and (5,4) on my row, and I need to think about how to approach them without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, I'm at (8,4), and there are apples at (4,4) and (5,4). That means there's an apple immediately to my left at (7,4), then (6,4), then (5,4), and another at (4,4). But looking at the board state you provided, it shows \"A A\" at (4,4) and (5,4), both on row 4.\n\nI need to think about the path to get to these apples. Also, there's an enemy snake at (3,5), which is above me, on row 5, column 3.\n\nI need to consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y, so up the board.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y, down the board.\n\n- Left: decrease X, left on the board.\n\n- Right: increase X, right on the board.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer and gain a point. If I run into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSince I'm at (8,4), and there are apples to my left on the same row, maybe I should move left to collect them.\n\nBut I need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (3,5). I don't know its length or direction, but since its body is listed as empty, it might just be the head at (3,5).\n\nI should also consider the other apples on the board, like at (0,7), (6,0), and (3,2).\n\nHowever, my immediate options are to move left, up, down, or right.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,4), which is the edge of the board. But since the coordinates range from 0 to 9, moving right from (9,4) would be out of bounds and cause me to die. So, right is not a safe move.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,4), which is towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,5), which is above my current position.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,3), below my current position.\n\nLet me think about moving left towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), I can eat the apple there. But I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't in my way or won't intercept me.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5), which is above me. If it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (4,4). But I don't know its movement patterns.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to maneuver around the enemy snake.\n\nWait, another apple is at (0,7), which is all the way to the bottom-left corner. That might be too far to reach without risking running into walls or other snakes.\n\nSimilarly, there's an apple at (6,0), which is at the bottom, near the left side.\n\nAnd an apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the apples that are closer to my current position, which are at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo, moving left seems like a reasonable option.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), eating the apple there, and then continue to (4,4) to eat another apple.\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves down to (3,4), it might block my path or intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,5), which is above my current position, there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom there, I could potentially move left towards (7,5), then down to (7,4), and then continue left towards the apples.\n\nBut that might be too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (8,3), then left towards the apple at (5,4).\n\nWait, but (5,4) is on row 4, so to get there from (8,3), I'd need to move left to (7,3), then (6,3), then (5,3), and then up to (5,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems inefficient and risky.\n\nPerhaps it's better to just move left directly towards (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n1. Move left to (7,4)\n\n2. Move left to (6,4)\n\n3. Move left to (5,4), eat the apple\n\n4. Move left to (4,4), eat another apple\n\n5. Then decide where to go next\n\nBut I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, down to (3,2).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples on my current row is the best approach.\n\nLet me think about the sequence again.\n\nI'm at (8,4).\n\nMove left to (7,4)\n\nThen left to (6,4)\n\nThen left to (5,4), eat apple\n\nThen left to (4,4), eat apple\n\nThen decide whether to go for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during this path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider growing longer by eating the apples, which would make me harder to be boxed in by the enemy snake.\n\nBut also, a longer snake means more squares to manage, which could be risky.\n\nWait, in this game, when you eat an apple, you grow longer. So, if I eat the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, and then eating another apple at (4,4) will make me even longer.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, as I move, my body extends to cover the new positions where I've been, up to the length gained from eating apples.\n\nIn this game, since multiple apples are on the board, I need to plan my path to collect as many as possible without running into myself or others.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first.\n\nI'm at (8,4), and the apples at (5,4) and (4,4) are directly to my left on the same row.\n\nSo, moving left seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves step by step.\n\nTurn 1: Move left to (7,4)\n\nTurn 2: Move left to (6,4)\n\nTurn 3: Move left to (5,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nTurn 4: Move left to (4,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nThen, I can assess the situation and decide where to go next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (3,5), and it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (3,4).\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's movement patterns or intentions.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that the enemy snake will try to block me or intercept"

I'm at (7,4), and there are apples at (5,4) and (4,4) on the same row. There's also an apple at (0,7), which is towards the bottom-left, and at (6,0), which is at the bottom, near the left side, and another at (3,2).\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are at (5,4) and (4,4), directly to my left. The enemy snake is at (4,5), which is above me.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for these close apples or aim for others. If I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4) to eat the apple, and then to (4,4) for another apple, that seems straightforward. But I have to worry about the enemy snake moving into my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (0,7), but that's pretty far away, and I might run into the enemy or make mistakes along the way.\n\nSimilarly, going for the apple at (6,0) would require moving down and left quite a bit, which could be risky.\n\nI think the best approach is to focus on the immediate apples to my left, at (5,4) and (4,4). They're close, and I can get to them without crossing too much of the board.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. If it's at (4,5), and it decides to move down to (4,4), where there's an apple, that could block my path or lead to a collision.\n\nMaybe I should try to eat the apple at (5,4) first, since it's closer, and then see what the enemy does. If I eat that apple, I'll grow longer, which might make it harder for the enemy to catch me.\n\nWait, but if I eat the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, meaning my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail as I move.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might try to intercept me as I go for the apples.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,4).\n\nThen, move left to (5,4) and eat the apple.\n\nThen, move left to (4,4) and eat that apple.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the situation and decide whether to go for another apple.\n\nBut I need to anticipate the enemy's movements. If the enemy is at (4,5), and it moves down to (4,4), where I'm going, that could be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I can eat the apple at (5,4), grow longer, and position myself in a way that makes it hard for the enemy to approach, that might be better.\n\nWait, another strategy could be to try to box the enemy snake if possible. But I'm not sure if that's feasible right now.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should just focus on collecting as many apples as I can quickly without worrying too much about the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to position myself between the enemy and the apples, perhaps forcing it to take a less optimal path.\n\nBut that might be too risky, especially since I don't know the enemy's behavior.\n\nI think the safest approach is to go for the closest apples and try to minimize the time spent exposed to the enemy.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,4), then to (5,4), eat the apple, then to (4,4), eat another apple.\n\nAfter that, I can look at the board again and decide whether to go for another apple or retreat to a safer area.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's position and adjust my path accordingly.\n\nGiven all that, I think my next move should be to move left to (6,4).\n\nThat way, I'm progressing towards the apples and not exposing myself unnecessarily to the enemy.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, lower Y values are towards the bottom, and higher Y values are upwards. X increases to the right and decreases to the left.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: an apple at (0,7), which is the bottom-left corner of row 7.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: enemy snake 1 at (3,5).\n\nRow 4: apples at (4,4) and (5,4); snake 2 at (8,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: apple at (3,2).\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: apple at (6,0).\n\nOkay, so I'm at (8,4), which is towards the right side of row 4. There are apples at (4,4) and (5,4) on my row, and I need to think about how to approach them without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, I'm at (8,4), and there are apples at (4,4) and (5,4). That means there's an apple immediately to my left at (7,4), then (6,4), then (5,4), and another at (4,4). But looking at the board state you provided, it shows \"A A\" at (4,4) and (5,4), both on row 4.\n\nI need to think about the path to get to these apples. Also, there's an enemy snake at (3,5), which is above me, on row 5, column 3.\n\nI need to consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y, so up the board.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y, down the board.\n\n- Left: decrease X, left on the board.\n\n- Right: increase X, right on the board.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer and gain a point. If I run into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSince I'm at (8,4), and there are apples to my left on the same row, maybe I should move left to collect them.\n\nBut I need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (3,5). I don't know its length or direction, but since its body is listed as empty, it might just be the head at (3,5).\n\nI should also consider the other apples on the board, like at (0,7), (6,0), and (3,2).\n\nHowever, my immediate options are to move left, up, down, or right.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,4), which is the edge of the board. But since the coordinates range from 0 to 9, moving right from (9,4) would be out of bounds and cause me to die. So, right is not a safe move.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,4), which is towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,5), which is above my current position.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,3), below my current position.\n\nLet me think about moving left towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), I can eat the apple there. But I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't in my way or won't intercept me.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5), which is above me. If it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (4,4). But I don't know its movement patterns.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to maneuver around the enemy snake.\n\nWait, another apple is at (0,7), which is all the way to the bottom-left corner. That might be too far to reach without risking running into walls or other snakes.\n\nSimilarly, there's an apple at (6,0), which is at the bottom, near the left side.\n\nAnd an apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the apples that are closer to my current position, which are at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo, moving left seems like a reasonable option.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), eating the apple there, and then continue to (4,4) to eat another apple.\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves down to (3,4), it might block my path or intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,5), which is above my current position, there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom there, I could potentially move left towards (7,5), then down to (7,4), and then continue left towards the apples.\n\nBut that might be too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (8,3), then left towards the apple at (5,4).\n\nWait, but (5,4) is on row 4, so to get there from (8,3), I'd need to move left to (7,3), then (6,3), then (5,3), and then up to (5,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems inefficient and risky.\n\nPerhaps it's better to just move left directly towards (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n1. Move left to (7,4)\n\n2. Move left to (6,4)\n\n3. Move left to (5,4), eat the apple\n\n4. Move left to (4,4), eat another apple\n\n5. Then decide where to go next\n\nBut I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, down to (3,2).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples on my current row is the best approach.\n\nLet me think about the sequence again.\n\nI'm at (8,4).\n\nMove left to (7,4)\n\nThen left to (6,4)\n\nThen left to (5,4), eat apple\n\nThen left to (4,4), eat apple\n\nThen decide whether to go for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during this path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider growing longer by eating the apples, which would make me harder to be boxed in by the enemy snake.\n\nBut also, a longer snake means more squares to manage, which could be risky.\n\nWait, in this game, when you eat an apple, you grow longer. So, if I eat the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, and then eating another apple at (4,4) will make me even longer.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, as I move, my body extends to cover the new positions where I've been, up to the length gained from eating apples.\n\nIn this game, since multiple apples are on the board, I need to plan my path to collect as many as possible without running into myself or others.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first.\n\nI'm at (8,4), and the apples at (5,4) and (4,4) are directly to my left on the same row.\n\nSo, moving left seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves step by step.\n\nTurn 1: Move left to (7,4)\n\nTurn 2: Move left to (6,4)\n\nTurn 3: Move left to (5,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nTurn 4: Move left to (4,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nThen, I can assess the situation and decide where to go next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (3,5), and it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (3,4).\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's movement patterns or intentions.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that the enemy snake will try to block me or intercept"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. My snake is at (6,4), which is actually (6,4), not (7,4) as I thought earlier. There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). The enemy snake is at (5,5) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to correct my understanding of the coordinates. If the board has Y increasing upwards, then (6,4) is my position, with (6,5) being above me, (6,3) below, (5,4) to the left, and (7,4) to the right.\n\nSo, from (6,4), moving left would be to (5,4), which has an apple. That's promising because eating it will make me grow and gain a point.\n\nLet me think about the enemy snake at (5,5). If I move to (5,4), which has an apple, the enemy might try to move to (5,4) as well to get the apple, but since I'm already there, I'll get it first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't bump into my own tail as I move.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (5,4), my snake will grow, so I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), perhaps I can move to (4,4), which also has an apple. Then, I can consider moving to (4,3) or elsewhere, depending on the board state.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy's position. If the enemy is at (5,5), it could potentially move down to (5,4), but since I'm already there, it can't.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might try to move left to (4,5) or up to (5,6), depending on its strategy.\n\nI should consider not only my moves but also anticipate possible moves of the enemy.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the board has multiple apples, so I need to prioritize which ones to go for first.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2).\n\n- My position: (6,4)\n\n- Enemy position: (5,5)\n\nFirst, the closest apples are at (5,4) and (4,4). Both are on my row, y=4.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), eat the apple, then move left again to (4,4) to eat another apple, that seems efficient.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down or up to go for other apples, but that might be riskier because it exposes me more to the enemy.\n\nWait, let's look at the positions again.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), eat the apple, then move left to (4,4), eat that apple.\n\nAt that point, I would have two apples, gaining two points.\n\nThen, I could consider moving to another apple, like (3,2) or (6,0), but those are relatively far.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (0,7), which is at the bottom-left, but that would require moving down to y=0, which is a long way.\n\nGiven that, it might be better to focus on the nearby apples to minimize exposure.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is at (5,5), which is just above me.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), the enemy could move down to (5,4), but since I'm already there, it can't.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might move left to (4,5) or up to (5,6).\n\nI need to consider the possible moves of the enemy and plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (5,4), eat the apple.\n\n2. Move left to (4,4), eat the apple.\n\n3. Then, perhaps move to (3,4), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,4), I could move down to (4,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,2), which is down and left.\n\nBut that seems a bit far, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (4,4) to (4,5), but the enemy is there.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (5,5), so if I'm at (4,4), the enemy is at (5,5), which is diagonally up-right from me.\n\nIn that case, moving up to (4,5) might bring me closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving down from (4,4) to (4,3) might be safer, but there's no apple there.\n\nI need to balance between gaining points by eating apples and avoiding the enemy.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat more apples, I grow longer, which makes it harder to maneuver and increases the chance of hitting my own tail.\n\nTherefore, I need to be careful not to get too long without a clear path.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apples first, which are at (5,4) and (4,4), and then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, I can consider moving to another apple, but I need to choose wisely to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to position myself in a way that the enemy can't easily approach me.\n\nBut predicting the enemy's moves is tricky, so I should focus on getting as many apples as possible quickly.\n\nLet me consider the possible paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Then what? Move to (3,4)? No apple there.\n\n- Or move down to (4,3)? No apple.\n\n- Maybe up to (4,5), but enemy is there.\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Up to (5,5), where the enemy is.\n\nBut the enemy is there, so that's not safe.\n\nPath 3:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\n- Then to (5,2), but no apple there.\n\nNot optimal.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,2), so maybe after eating (5,4) and (4,4), I can move down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's a bit convoluted and exposes me to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,4) and (4,4), I could move up to (4,5), but the enemy is there.\n\nThat doesn't seem safe.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (6,0), which is directly below me.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move down to (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's a long path, and I might be exposed to the enemy during that time.\n\nAlso, the enemy could move down and intercept me.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,0), I would be even longer, making it harder to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (0,7), which is at the bottom-left.\n\nFrom (6,4), I would need to move left to (5,4), eat the apple, then left to (4,4), eat that apple, then maybe down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), eat the apple, then try to make my way to (0,7).\n\nThis seems too complicated and time-consuming, with too many opportunities for mistakes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the immediate area around me.\n\nLet me consider just going for the apples at (5,4) and (4,4), eating them, and then deciding based on the enemy's position.\n\nIf the enemy moves away, I can consider going for another apple.\n\nIf the enemy comes closer, I might need to retreat or find a way to escape.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat more apples, I grow longer, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.\n\nIt's an advantage because I can block the enemy's path, but a disadvantage because I have to manage a longer tail and avoid hitting it.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best first move is to go left to (5,4), eat the apple, and then plan the next move based on the enemy's response.\n\nSo, for now, I'll decide to move left.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, lower Y values are towards the bottom, and higher Y values are upwards. X increases to the right and decreases to the left.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: an apple at (0,7), which is the bottom-left corner of row 7.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: enemy snake 1 at (3,5).\n\nRow 4: apples at (4,4) and (5,4); snake 2 at (8,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: apple at (3,2).\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: apple at (6,0).\n\nOkay, so I'm at (8,4), which is towards the right side of row 4. There are apples at (4,4) and (5,4) on my row, and I need to think about how to approach them without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, I'm at (8,4), and there are apples at (4,4) and (5,4). That means there's an apple immediately to my left at (7,4), then (6,4), then (5,4), and another at (4,4). But looking at the board state you provided, it shows \"A A\" at (4,4) and (5,4), both on row 4.\n\nI need to think about the path to get to these apples. Also, there's an enemy snake at (3,5), which is above me, on row 5, column 3.\n\nI need to consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y, so up the board.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y, down the board.\n\n- Left: decrease X, left on the board.\n\n- Right: increase X, right on the board.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer and gain a point. If I run into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSince I'm at (8,4), and there are apples to my left on the same row, maybe I should move left to collect them.\n\nBut I need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (3,5). I don't know its length or direction, but since its body is listed as empty, it might just be the head at (3,5).\n\nI should also consider the other apples on the board, like at (0,7), (6,0), and (3,2).\n\nHowever, my immediate options are to move left, up, down, or right.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,4), which is the edge of the board. But since the coordinates range from 0 to 9, moving right from (9,4) would be out of bounds and cause me to die. So, right is not a safe move.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,4), which is towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,5), which is above my current position.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,3), below my current position.\n\nLet me think about moving left towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), I can eat the apple there. But I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't in my way or won't intercept me.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5), which is above me. If it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (4,4). But I don't know its movement patterns.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to maneuver around the enemy snake.\n\nWait, another apple is at (0,7), which is all the way to the bottom-left corner. That might be too far to reach without risking running into walls or other snakes.\n\nSimilarly, there's an apple at (6,0), which is at the bottom, near the left side.\n\nAnd an apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the apples that are closer to my current position, which are at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo, moving left seems like a reasonable option.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), eating the apple there, and then continue to (4,4) to eat another apple.\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves down to (3,4), it might block my path or intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,5), which is above my current position, there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom there, I could potentially move left towards (7,5), then down to (7,4), and then continue left towards the apples.\n\nBut that might be too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (8,3), then left towards the apple at (5,4).\n\nWait, but (5,4) is on row 4, so to get there from (8,3), I'd need to move left to (7,3), then (6,3), then (5,3), and then up to (5,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems inefficient and risky.\n\nPerhaps it's better to just move left directly towards (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n1. Move left to (7,4)\n\n2. Move left to (6,4)\n\n3. Move left to (5,4), eat the apple\n\n4. Move left to (4,4), eat another apple\n\n5. Then decide where to go next\n\nBut I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, down to (3,2).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples on my current row is the best approach.\n\nLet me think about the sequence again.\n\nI'm at (8,4).\n\nMove left to (7,4)\n\nThen left to (6,4)\n\nThen left to (5,4), eat apple\n\nThen left to (4,4), eat apple\n\nThen decide whether to go for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during this path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider growing longer by eating the apples, which would make me harder to be boxed in by the enemy snake.\n\nBut also, a longer snake means more squares to manage, which could be risky.\n\nWait, in this game, when you eat an apple, you grow longer. So, if I eat the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, and then eating another apple at (4,4) will make me even longer.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, as I move, my body extends to cover the new positions where I've been, up to the length gained from eating apples.\n\nIn this game, since multiple apples are on the board, I need to plan my path to collect as many as possible without running into myself or others.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first.\n\nI'm at (8,4), and the apples at (5,4) and (4,4) are directly to my left on the same row.\n\nSo, moving left seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves step by step.\n\nTurn 1: Move left to (7,4)\n\nTurn 2: Move left to (6,4)\n\nTurn 3: Move left to (5,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nTurn 4: Move left to (4,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nThen, I can assess the situation and decide where to go next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (3,5), and it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (3,4).\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's movement patterns or intentions.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that the enemy snake will try to block me or intercept"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. My snake is at (6,4), which is actually (6,4), not (7,4) as I thought earlier. There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). The enemy snake is at (5,5) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to correct my understanding of the coordinates. If the board has Y increasing upwards, then (6,4) is my position, with (6,5) being above me, (6,3) below, (5,4) to the left, and (7,4) to the right.\n\nSo, from (6,4), moving left would be to (5,4), which has an apple. That's promising because eating it will make me grow and gain a point.\n\nLet me think about the enemy snake at (5,5).

Then, I can consider moving to (4,3) or elsewhere, depending on the board state.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy's position.

Then, perhaps move to (3,4), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,4), I could move down to (4,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,2), which is down and left.\n\nBut that seems a bit far, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (4,4) to (4,5), but the enemy is there.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (5,5), so if I'm at (4,4), the enemy is at (5,5), which is diagonally up-right from me.\n\nIn that case, moving up to (4,5) might bring me closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving down from (4,4) to (4,3) might be safer, but there's no apple there.\n\nI need to balance between gaining points by eating apples and avoiding the enemy.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat more apples, I grow longer, which makes it harder to maneuver and increases the chance of hitting my own tail.\n\nTherefore, I need to be careful not to get too long without a clear path.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apples first, which are at (5,4) and (4,4), and then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, I can consider moving to another apple, but I need to choose wisely to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to position myself in a way that the enemy can't easily approach me.\n\nBut predicting the enemy's moves is tricky, so I should focus on getting as many apples as possible quickly.\n\nLet me consider the possible paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Then what? Move to (3,4)? No apple there.\n\n- Or move down to (4,3)? No apple.\n\n- Maybe up to (4,5), but enemy is there.\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Up to (5,5), where the enemy is.\n\nBut the enemy is there, so that's not safe.\n\nPath 3:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\n- Then to (5,2), but no apple there.\n\nNot optimal.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,2), so maybe after eating (5,4) and (4,4), I can move down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's a bit convoluted and exposes me to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,4) and (4,4), I could move up to (4,5), but the enemy is there.\n\nThat doesn't seem safe.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (6,0), which is directly below me.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move down to (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's a long path, and I might be exposed to the enemy during that time.\n\nAlso, the enemy could move down and intercept me.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,0), I would be even longer, making it harder to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (0,7), which is at the bottom-left.\n\nFrom (6,4), I would need to move left to (5,4), eat the apple, then left to (4,4), eat that apple, then maybe down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), eat the apple, then try to make my way to (0,7).\n\nThis seems too complicated and time-consuming, with too many opportunities for mistakes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the immediate area around me.\n\nLet me consider just going for the apples at (5,4) and (4,4), eating them, and then deciding based on the enemy's position.\n\nIf the enemy moves away, I can consider going for another apple.\n\nIf the enemy comes closer, I might need to retreat or find a way to escape.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat more apples, I grow longer, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.\n\nIt's an advantage because I can block the enemy's path, but a disadvantage because I have to manage a longer tail and avoid hitting it.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best first move is to go left to (5,4), eat the apple, and then plan the next move based on the enemy's response.\n\nSo, for now, I'll decide to move left.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. My snake is at (5,4), not (6,4) as I thought earlier. There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). The enemy snake is at (5,6) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to correct my understanding of the coordinates. If the board has Y increasing upwards, then (5,4) is my position, with (5,5) being above me, (5,3) below, (4,4) to the left, and (6,4) to the right.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving left would be to (4,4), which has an apple. That's promising because eating it will make me grow and gain a point.\n\nLet me think about the enemy snake at (5,6). If I move to (4,4), which has an apple, the enemy might try to move down to (5,5), but since I'm moving left, I should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,4), I'll grow longer, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that I don't bump into my own tail as I move.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (4,4), my snake will grow, so I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAfter eating (4,4), perhaps I can move to (3,4), which doesn't have an apple, but it's a direction to explore.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up to (4,5), but there's no apple there, and the enemy is at (5,6), which is above and to the right of my current position.\n\nI need to be cautious of the enemy's position. If the enemy is at (5,6), it could potentially move down to (5,5), then to (5,4), but since I'm at (4,4) after moving left, it would have to move left to (4,4), but I'm already there.\n\nWait, no. If I move to (4,4), and the enemy moves down to (5,5), then to (5,4), but I'm at (4,4), so it can't occupy the same space.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the possible moves step by step.\n\nLet me outline a plan:\n\n1. Move left to (4,4), eat the apple.\n\n2. From (4,4), check the surroundings:\n\n- Left: (3,4) no apple\n\n- Right: (5,4) occupied by me or enemy?\n\n- Up: (4,5) no apple\n\n- Down: (4,3) no apple\n\n3. Depending on the enemy's position, choose the next move.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider moving right to (6,4), which has an apple, instead of left.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,0), but that's a long way down.\n\nLet me compare the options:\n\nOption A: Move left to (4,4), eat apple.\n\n- Advantage: immediate apple, closer apples at (3,2)\n\n- Disadvantage: enemy might maneuver to block my path\n\nOption B: Move right to (6,4), eat apple.\n\n- Advantage: immediate apple, closer to (6,0)\n\n- Disadvantage: closer to the enemy, which is at (5,6)\n\nOption C: Move up to (5,5), but there's no apple there, and the enemy is there.\n\n- Not a good idea.\n\nOption D: Move down to (5,3), no apple.\n\n- Not attractive.\n\nGiven that, Option A and Option B are the main choices.\n\nOption A: Move left to (4,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving to (3,4), then to (3,3), then to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\n- This path seems feasible, and I can avoid the enemy if it stays at (5,6).\n\nOption B: Move right to (6,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving down to (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then (6,0) to eat the apple at (6,0).\n\n- However, this path is longer and keeps me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think Option A is better.\n\nSo, my decision is to move left to (4,4), eat the apple, and then plan the next moves based on the enemy's position.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, lower Y values are towards the bottom, and higher Y values are upwards. X increases to the right and decreases to the left.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: an apple at (0,7), which is the bottom-left corner of row 7.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: enemy snake 1 at (3,5).\n\nRow 4: apples at (4,4) and (5,4); snake 2 at (8,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: apple at (3,2).\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: apple at (6,0).\n\nOkay, so I'm at (8,4), which is towards the right side of row 4. There are apples at (4,4) and (5,4) on my row, and I need to think about how to approach them without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, I'm at (8,4), and there are apples at (4,4) and (5,4). That means there's an apple immediately to my left at (7,4), then (6,4), then (5,4), and another at (4,4). But looking at the board state you provided, it shows \"A A\" at (4,4) and (5,4), both on row 4.\n\nI need to think about the path to get to these apples. Also, there's an enemy snake at (3,5), which is above me, on row 5, column 3.\n\nI need to consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y, so up the board.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y, down the board.\n\n- Left: decrease X, left on the board.\n\n- Right: increase X, right on the board.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer and gain a point. If I run into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSince I'm at (8,4), and there are apples to my left on the same row, maybe I should move left to collect them.\n\nBut I need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (3,5). I don't know its length or direction, but since its body is listed as empty, it might just be the head at (3,5).\n\nI should also consider the other apples on the board, like at (0,7), (6,0), and (3,2).\n\nHowever, my immediate options are to move left, up, down, or right.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,4), which is the edge of the board. But since the coordinates range from 0 to 9, moving right from (9,4) would be out of bounds and cause me to die. So, right is not a safe move.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,4), which is towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,5), which is above my current position.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,3), below my current position.\n\nLet me think about moving left towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), I can eat the apple there. But I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't in my way or won't intercept me.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5), which is above me. If it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (4,4). But I don't know its movement patterns.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to maneuver around the enemy snake.\n\nWait, another apple is at (0,7), which is all the way to the bottom-left corner. That might be too far to reach without risking running into walls or other snakes.\n\nSimilarly, there's an apple at (6,0), which is at the bottom, near the left side.\n\nAnd an apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the apples that are closer to my current position, which are at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo, moving left seems like a reasonable option.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), eating the apple there, and then continue to (4,4) to eat another apple.\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves down to (3,4), it might block my path or intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,5), which is above my current position, there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom there, I could potentially move left towards (7,5), then down to (7,4), and then continue left towards the apples.\n\nBut that might be too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (8,3), then left towards the apple at (5,4).\n\nWait, but (5,4) is on row 4, so to get there from (8,3), I'd need to move left to (7,3), then (6,3), then (5,3), and then up to (5,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems inefficient and risky.\n\nPerhaps it's better to just move left directly towards (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n1. Move left to (7,4)\n\n2. Move left to (6,4)\n\n3. Move left to (5,4), eat the apple\n\n4. Move left to (4,4), eat another apple\n\n5. Then decide where to go next\n\nBut I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, down to (3,2).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples on my current row is the best approach.\n\nLet me think about the sequence again.\n\nI'm at (8,4).\n\nMove left to (7,4)\n\nThen left to (6,4)\n\nThen left to (5,4), eat apple\n\nThen left to (4,4), eat apple\n\nThen decide whether to go for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during this path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider growing longer by eating the apples, which would make me harder to be boxed in by the enemy snake.\n\nBut also, a longer snake means more squares to manage, which could be risky.\n\nWait, in this game, when you eat an apple, you grow longer. So, if I eat the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, and then eating another apple at (4,4) will make me even longer.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, as I move, my body extends to cover the new positions where I've been, up to the length gained from eating apples.\n\nIn this game, since multiple apples are on the board, I need to plan my path to collect as many as possible without running into myself or others.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first.\n\nI'm at (8,4), and the apples at (5,4) and (4,4) are directly to my left on the same row.\n\nSo, moving left seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves step by step.\n\nTurn 1: Move left to (7,4)\n\nTurn 2: Move left to (6,4)\n\nTurn 3: Move left to (5,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nTurn 4: Move left to (4,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nThen, I can assess the situation and decide where to go next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (3,5), and it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (3,4).\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's movement patterns or intentions.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that the enemy snake will try to block me or intercept"

But I'm not sure if that's feasible right now.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should just focus on collecting as many apples as I can quickly without worrying too much about the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to position myself between the enemy and the apples, perhaps forcing it to take a less optimal path.\n\nBut that might be too risky, especially since I don't know the enemy's behavior.\n\nI think the safest approach is to go for the closest apples and try to minimize the time spent exposed to the enemy.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,4), then to (5,4), eat the apple, then to (4,4), eat another apple.\n\nAfter that, I can look at the board again and decide whether to go for another apple or retreat to a safer area.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's position and adjust my path accordingly.\n\nGiven all that, I think my next move should be to move left to (6,4).\n\nThat way, I'm progressing towards the apples and not exposing myself unnecessarily to the enemy.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. My snake is at (6,4), which is actually (6,4), not (7,4) as I thought earlier. There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). The enemy snake is at (5,5) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to correct my understanding of the coordinates.

I need to make sure that I don't bump into my own tail as I move.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (5,4), my snake will grow, so I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting my own tail.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), perhaps I can move to (4,4), which also has an apple. Then, I can consider moving to (4,3) or elsewhere, depending on the board state.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy's position. If the enemy is at (5,5), it could potentially move down to (5,4), but since I'm already there, it can't.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might try to move left to (4,5) or up to (5,6), depending on its strategy.\n\nI should consider not only my moves but also anticipate possible moves of the enemy.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the board has multiple apples, so I need to prioritize which ones to go for first.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2).\n\n- My position: (6,4)\n\n- Enemy position: (5,5)\n\nFirst, the closest apples are at (5,4) and (4,4). Both are on my row, y=4.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), eat the apple, then move left again to (4,4) to eat another apple, that seems efficient.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down or up to go for other apples, but that might be riskier because it exposes me more to the enemy.\n\nWait, let's look at the positions again.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), eat the apple, then move left to (4,4), eat that apple.\n\nAt that point, I would have two apples, gaining two points.\n\nThen, I could consider moving to another apple, like (3,2) or (6,0), but those are relatively far.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (0,7), which is at the bottom-left, but that would require moving down to y=0, which is a long way.\n\nGiven that, it might be better to focus on the nearby apples to minimize exposure.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is at (5,5), which is just above me.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), the enemy could move down to (5,4), but since I'm already there, it can't.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might move left to (4,5) or up to (5,6).\n\nI need to consider the possible moves of the enemy and plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

Then, perhaps move to (3,4), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,4), I could move down to (4,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,2), which is down and left.\n\nBut that seems a bit far, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up from (4,4) to (4,5), but the enemy is there.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (5,5), so if I'm at (4,4), the enemy is at (5,5), which is diagonally up-right from me.\n\nIn that case, moving up to (4,5) might bring me closer to the enemy, which could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving down from (4,4) to (4,3) might be safer, but there's no apple there.\n\nI need to balance between gaining points by eating apples and avoiding the enemy.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat more apples, I grow longer, which makes it harder to maneuver and increases the chance of hitting my own tail.\n\nTherefore, I need to be careful not to get too long without a clear path.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apples first, which are at (5,4) and (4,4), and then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, I can consider moving to another apple, but I need to choose wisely to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to position myself in a way that the enemy can't easily approach me.\n\nBut predicting the enemy's moves is tricky, so I should focus on getting as many apples as possible quickly.\n\nLet me consider the possible paths.\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Then what? Move to (3,4)? No apple there.\n\n- Or move down to (4,3)? No apple.\n\n- Maybe up to (4,5), but enemy is there.\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Up to (5,5), where the enemy is.\n\nBut the enemy is there, so that's not safe.\n\nPath 3:\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\n- Then to (5,2), but no apple there.\n\nNot optimal.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (3,2), so maybe after eating (5,4) and (4,4), I can move down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's a bit convoluted and exposes me to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,4) and (4,4), I could move up to (4,5), but the enemy is there.\n\nThat doesn't seem safe.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (6,0), which is directly below me.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move down to (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's a long path, and I might be exposed to the enemy during that time.\n\nAlso, the enemy could move down and intercept me.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,0), I would be even longer, making it harder to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (0,7), which is at the bottom-left.\n\nFrom (6,4), I would need to move left to (5,4), eat the apple, then left to (4,4), eat that apple, then maybe down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), eat the apple, then try to make my way to (0,7).\n\nThis seems too complicated and time-consuming, with too many opportunities for mistakes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the immediate area around me.\n\nLet me consider just going for the apples at (5,4) and (4,4), eating them, and then deciding based on the enemy's position.\n\nIf the enemy moves away, I can consider going for another apple.\n\nIf the enemy comes closer, I might need to retreat or find a way to escape.\n\nAnother consideration is that as I eat more apples, I grow longer, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.\n\nIt's an advantage because I can block the enemy's path, but a disadvantage because I have to manage a longer tail and avoid hitting it.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best first move is to go left to (5,4), eat the apple, and then plan the next move based on the enemy's response.\n\nSo, for now, I'll decide to move left.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. My snake is at (4,4), not (5,4) as I thought earlier. There are apples at (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), and (7,8). The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to correct my understanding of the coordinates. If the board has Y increasing upwards, then (4,4) is my position, with (4,5) being above me, (4,3) below, (3,4) to the left, and (5,4) to the right.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving left would be to (3,4), which doesn't have an apple. Wait, earlier I thought there was an apple at (4,4), but looking at the apple positions, there's an apple at (3,2), not at (4,4). Hmm, I must have misread that.\n\nLet me double-check the apple positions: (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), (7,8). So, no apple at (4,4). That changes things.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose a direction to move in, considering there's no apple at my immediate left. So, moving left to (3,4) wouldn't give me an apple.\n\nLet me consider other directions:\n\n- Right: (5,4) \u2013 no apple there either, based on the list.\n\n- Up: (4,5) \u2013 no apple.\n\n- Down: (4,3) \u2013 no apple.\n\nSo, none of the adjacent squares have apples. I need to decide which direction to move in to best position myself to get to an apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- Apples at: (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), (7,8)\n\n- Enemy snake at: (5,7)\n\n- My position: (4,4)\n\nI should consider which apple is closest to me and plan a path to it, while being aware of the enemy's position.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- To (0,7): |4-0| + |4-7| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- To (6,0): |4-6| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (3,2): |4-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (2,5): |4-2| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |4-8| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,2) and (2,5), both with a distance of 3.\n\nLet me see the paths to these apples.\n\nFirst, to (3,2):\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2). That's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,4), down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2). Also three moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (2,5):\n\nFrom (4,4), up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then left to (2,5). Three moves.\n\nAlternatively, left to (3,4), then up to (3,5), then left to (2,5). Also three moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy's position at (5,7). The enemy is relatively far from me, and its possible movements might not immediately affect me.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious not to put myself in a position where the enemy can cut off my path or box me in.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (3,2):\n\nIf I move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), the enemy is at (5,7), which is up and to the right of me.\n\nIt would have to move down and to the left to intercept me, but it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (2,5):\n\nIf I move up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then left to (2,5), the enemy is at (5,7), so it's below and to the left relative to the enemy.\n\nAgain, the enemy would need to move down and to the left to intercept me, which might take some time.\n\nBetween (3,2) and (2,5), both are equally distant, but perhaps (2,5) is a better choice because it's closer to the top left corner, where there's another apple at (0,7).\n\nAlternatively, going to (6,0) is also an option, but it's farther away with a distance of 6.\n\nConsidering that, perhaps focusing on (2,5) first, then moving to (0,7) would be a better strategy.\n\nBut, I need to make a decision for the next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving up to (4,5) would be a good starting point towards (2,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (3,4) would put me closer to both (3,2) and (2,5).\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then to (3,2), the enemy is at (5,7), and it might try to move down to block my path, but it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (4,5), the enemy is at (5,7), and it can move down to (5,6), then (5,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't let the enemy box me in.\n\nPerhaps the safest initial move is to move left to (3,4), as it moves me away from the enemy and towards the closest apples.\n\nAdditionally, moving left doesn't bring me closer to any walls, which is good for maneuverability.\n\nLet me consider the possible enemy movements.\n\nIf the enemy moves down from (5,7) to (5,6), I can continue moving left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), and so on.\n\nThe enemy would have to make a series of moves to intercept me, and I can adjust my path accordingly.\n\nMoreover, by moving left, I'm also positioning myself to potentially go towards (2,5) or (3,2), depending on which one is less threatened by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (4,5), I'm moving closer to the enemy's row, which might not be ideal.\n\nTherefore, moving left seems like a safer and more strategic choice for now.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, lower Y values are towards the bottom, and higher Y values are upwards. X increases to the right and decreases to the left.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: an apple at (0,7), which is the bottom-left corner of row 7.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: enemy snake 1 at (3,5).\n\nRow 4: apples at (4,4) and (5,4); snake 2 at (8,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: apple at (3,2).\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: apple at (6,0).\n\nOkay, so I'm at (8,4), which is towards the right side of row 4. There are apples at (4,4) and (5,4) on my row, and I need to think about how to approach them without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, I'm at (8,4), and there are apples at (4,4) and (5,4). That means there's an apple immediately to my left at (7,4), then (6,4), then (5,4), and another at (4,4). But looking at the board state you provided, it shows \"A A\" at (4,4) and (5,4), both on row 4.\n\nI need to think about the path to get to these apples. Also, there's an enemy snake at (3,5), which is above me, on row 5, column 3.\n\nI need to consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y, so up the board.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y, down the board.\n\n- Left: decrease X, left on the board.\n\n- Right: increase X, right on the board.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer and gain a point. If I run into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSince I'm at (8,4), and there are apples to my left on the same row, maybe I should move left to collect them.\n\nBut I need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (3,5). I don't know its length or direction, but since its body is listed as empty, it might just be the head at (3,5).\n\nI should also consider the other apples on the board, like at (0,7), (6,0), and (3,2).\n\nHowever, my immediate options are to move left, up, down, or right.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,4), which is the edge of the board. But since the coordinates range from 0 to 9, moving right from (9,4) would be out of bounds and cause me to die. So, right is not a safe move.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,4), which is towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,5), which is above my current position.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,3), below my current position.\n\nLet me think about moving left towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), I can eat the apple there. But I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't in my way or won't intercept me.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5), which is above me. If it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (4,4). But I don't know its movement patterns.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to maneuver around the enemy snake.\n\nWait, another apple is at (0,7), which is all the way to the bottom-left corner. That might be too far to reach without risking running into walls or other snakes.\n\nSimilarly, there's an apple at (6,0), which is at the bottom, near the left side.\n\nAnd an apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the apples that are closer to my current position, which are at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo, moving left seems like a reasonable option.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), eating the apple there, and then continue to (4,4) to eat another apple.\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves down to (3,4), it might block my path or intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,5), which is above my current position, there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom there, I could potentially move left towards (7,5), then down to (7,4), and then continue left towards the apples.\n\nBut that might be too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (8,3), then left towards the apple at (5,4).\n\nWait, but (5,4) is on row 4, so to get there from (8,3), I'd need to move left to (7,3), then (6,3), then (5,3), and then up to (5,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems inefficient and risky.\n\nPerhaps it's better to just move left directly towards (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n1. Move left to (7,4)\n\n2. Move left to (6,4)\n\n3. Move left to (5,4), eat the apple\n\n4. Move left to (4,4), eat another apple\n\n5. Then decide where to go next\n\nBut I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, down to (3,2).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples on my current row is the best approach.\n\nLet me think about the sequence again.\n\nI'm at (8,4).\n\nMove left to (7,4)\n\nThen left to (6,4)\n\nThen left to (5,4), eat apple\n\nThen left to (4,4), eat apple\n\nThen decide whether to go for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during this path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider growing longer by eating the apples, which would make me harder to be boxed in by the enemy snake.\n\nBut also, a longer snake means more squares to manage, which could be risky.\n\nWait, in this game, when you eat an apple, you grow longer. So, if I eat the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, and then eating another apple at (4,4) will make me even longer.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, as I move, my body extends to cover the new positions where I've been, up to the length gained from eating apples.\n\nIn this game, since multiple apples are on the board, I need to plan my path to collect as many as possible without running into myself or others.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first.\n\nI'm at (8,4), and the apples at (5,4) and (4,4) are directly to my left on the same row.\n\nSo, moving left seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves step by step.\n\nTurn 1: Move left to (7,4)\n\nTurn 2: Move left to (6,4)\n\nTurn 3: Move left to (5,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nTurn 4: Move left to (4,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nThen, I can assess the situation and decide where to go next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (3,5), and it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (3,4).\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's movement patterns or intentions.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that the enemy snake will try to block me or intercept"

If I move to (4,4), and the enemy moves down to (5,5), then to (5,4), but I'm at (4,4), so it can't occupy the same space.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the possible moves step by step.\n\nLet me outline a plan:\n\n1. Move left to (4,4), eat the apple.\n\n2. From (4,4), check the surroundings:\n\n- Left: (3,4) no apple\n\n- Right: (5,4) occupied by me or enemy?\n\n- Up: (4,5) no apple\n\n- Down: (4,3) no apple\n\n3. Depending on the enemy's position, choose the next move.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider moving right to (6,4), which has an apple, instead of left.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,0), but that's a long way down.\n\nLet me compare the options:\n\nOption A: Move left to (4,4), eat apple.\n\n- Advantage: immediate apple, closer apples at (3,2)\n\n- Disadvantage: enemy might maneuver to block my path\n\nOption B: Move right to (6,4), eat apple.\n\n- Advantage: immediate apple, closer to (6,0)\n\n- Disadvantage: closer to the enemy, which is at (5,6)\n\nOption C: Move up to (5,5), but there's no apple there, and the enemy is there.\n\n- Not a good idea.\n\nOption D: Move down to (5,3), no apple.\n\n- Not attractive.\n\nGiven that, Option A and Option B are the main choices.\n\nOption A: Move left to (4,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving to (3,4), then to (3,3), then to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\n- This path seems feasible, and I can avoid the enemy if it stays at (5,6).\n\nOption B: Move right to (6,4)\n\n- After eating the apple, I can consider moving down to (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then (6,0) to eat the apple at (6,0).\n\n- However, this path is longer and keeps me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think Option A is better.\n\nSo, my decision is to move left to (4,4), eat the apple, and then plan the next moves based on the enemy's position.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this snake game. Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. My snake is at (4,4), not (5,4) as I thought earlier. There are apples at (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), and (7,8). The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to correct my understanding of the coordinates. If the board has Y increasing upwards, then (4,4) is my position, with (4,5) being above me, (4,3) below, (3,4) to the left, and (5,4) to the right.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving left would be to (3,4), which doesn't have an apple. Wait, earlier I thought there was an apple at (4,4), but looking at the apple positions, there's an apple at (3,2), not at (4,4). Hmm, I must have misread that.\n\nLet me double-check the apple positions: (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), (7,8). So, no apple at (4,4). That changes things.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose a direction to move in, considering there's no apple at my immediate left. So, moving left to (3,4) wouldn't give me an apple.\n\nLet me consider other directions:\n\n- Right: (5,4) \u2013 no apple there either, based on the list.\n\n- Up: (4,5) \u2013 no apple.\n\n- Down: (4,3) \u2013 no apple.\n\nSo, none of the adjacent squares have apples. I need to decide which direction to move in to best position myself to get to an apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- Apples at: (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), (7,8)\n\n- Enemy snake at: (5,7)\n\n- My position: (4,4)\n\nI should consider which apple is closest to me and plan a path to it, while being aware of the enemy's position.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- To (0,7): |4-0| + |4-7| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- To (6,0): |4-6| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (3,2): |4-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (2,5): |4-2| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |4-8| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,2) and (2,5), both with a distance of 3.\n\nLet me see the paths to these apples.\n\nFirst, to (3,2):\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2). That's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,4), down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2). Also three moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (2,5):\n\nFrom (4,4), up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then left to (2,5). Three moves.\n\nAlternatively, left to (3,4), then up to (3,5), then left to (2,5). Also three moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy's position at (5,7). The enemy is relatively far from me, and its possible movements might not immediately affect me.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious not to put myself in a position where the enemy can cut off my path or box me in.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (3,2):\n\nIf I move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), the enemy is at (5,7), which is up and to the right of me.\n\nIt would have to move down and to the left to intercept me, but it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (2,5):\n\nIf I move up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then left to (2,5), the enemy is at (5,7), so it's below and to the left relative to the enemy.\n\nAgain, the enemy would need to move down and to the left to intercept me, which might take some time.\n\nBetween (3,2) and (2,5), both are equally distant, but perhaps (2,5) is a better choice because it's closer to the top left corner, where there's another apple at (0,7).\n\nAlternatively, going to (6,0) is also an option, but it's farther away with a distance of 6.\n\nConsidering that, perhaps focusing on (2,5) first, then moving to (0,7) would be a better strategy.\n\nBut, I need to make a decision for the next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving up to (4,5) would be a good starting point towards (2,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (3,4) would put me closer to both (3,2) and (2,5).\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then to (3,2), the enemy is at (5,7), and it might try to move down to block my path, but it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (4,5), the enemy is at (5,7), and it can move down to (5,6), then (5,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't let the enemy box me in.\n\nPerhaps the safest initial move is to move left to (3,4), as it moves me away from the enemy and towards the closest apples.\n\nAdditionally, moving left doesn't bring me closer to any walls, which is good for maneuverability.\n\nLet me consider the possible enemy movements.\n\nIf the enemy moves down from (5,7) to (5,6), I can continue moving left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), and so on.\n\nThe enemy would have to make a series of moves to intercept me, and I can adjust my path accordingly.\n\nMoreover, by moving left, I'm also positioning myself to potentially go towards (2,5) or (3,2), depending on which one is less threatened by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (4,5), I'm moving closer to the enemy's row, which might not be ideal.\n\nTherefore, moving left seems like a safer and more strategic choice for now.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

My snake is at (3,4), and its body seems to be extending to the right, based on the 'T T' in the board state.

From the board state provided:\n\n- Row 9: all dots, meaning empty.\n\n- Row 8: dots except for snake #1 at (5,8) and an apple at (6,0). Wait, (6,0) is in row 0, not row 8. There might be a confusion here.\n\nActually, looking back, the board state seems to have rows listed from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom, and columns from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, position (x,y) corresponds to column x, row y.\n\nGiven that, my snake is at (3,4), which is column 3, row 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,7): column 0, row 7\n\n- (6,0): column 6, row 0\n\n- (3,2): column 3, row 2\n\n- (2,5): column 2, row 5\n\n- (7,8): column 7, row 8\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,8): column 5, row 8.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions relative to my current location.\n\nLet's list out the possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,5)\n\n- Down: (3,3)\n\n- Left: (2,4)\n\n- Right: (4,4)\n\nI need to check if any of these positions have apples.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (0,7): not adjacent.\n\n- (6,0): not adjacent.\n\n- (3,2): down two spaces, not adjacent.\n\n- (2,5): left and up, not adjacent.\n\n- (7,8): not adjacent.\n\nSo, none of the immediate neighboring cells have apples.\n\nTherefore, I need to choose a direction that moves me towards an apple while avoiding the enemy and not hitting walls or myself.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position:\n\n- (0,7): left and up.\n\n- (6,0): right and down.\n\n- (3,2): down two spaces.\n\n- (2,5): left and up.\n\n- (7,8): right and up.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (3,2), (2,5), and (7,8), based on Manhattan distance.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- To (0,7): |3-0| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (6,0): |3-6| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- To (3,2): |3-3| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- To (2,5): |3-2| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (7,8): |3-7| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are (3,2) and (2,5), both at a distance of 2.\n\nLet me consider paths to these apples.\n\nFirst, to (3,2):\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nAlternatively, I can move left to (2,4), then down to (2,3), then down to (2,2), but that's farther away.\n\nWait, but (3,2) is directly down from me.\n\nSo, moving down to (3,3), then down to (3,2) seems straightforward.\n\nSimilarly, to (2,5):\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move left to (2,4), then up to (2,5).\n\nThat's also two moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy's position at (5,8).

There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). Oh, and there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, lower Y values are towards the bottom, and higher Y values are upwards. X increases to the right and decreases to the left.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: all dots.\n\nRow 7: an apple at (0,7), which is the bottom-left corner of row 7.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: enemy snake 1 at (3,5).\n\nRow 4: apples at (4,4) and (5,4); snake 2 at (8,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: apple at (3,2).\n\nRow 1: all dots.\n\nRow 0: apple at (6,0).\n\nOkay, so I'm at (8,4), which is towards the right side of row 4. There are apples at (4,4) and (5,4) on my row, and I need to think about how to approach them without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nWait, I'm at (8,4), and there are apples at (4,4) and (5,4). That means there's an apple immediately to my left at (7,4), then (6,4), then (5,4), and another at (4,4). But looking at the board state you provided, it shows \"A A\" at (4,4) and (5,4), both on row 4.\n\nI need to think about the path to get to these apples. Also, there's an enemy snake at (3,5), which is above me, on row 5, column 3.\n\nI need to consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: towards higher Y, so up the board.\n\n- Down: towards lower Y, down the board.\n\n- Left: decrease X, left on the board.\n\n- Right: increase X, right on the board.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer and gain a point. If I run into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSince I'm at (8,4), and there are apples to my left on the same row, maybe I should move left to collect them.\n\nBut I need to be careful because there's an enemy snake at (3,5). I don't know its length or direction, but since its body is listed as empty, it might just be the head at (3,5).\n\nI should also consider the other apples on the board, like at (0,7), (6,0), and (3,2).\n\nHowever, my immediate options are to move left, up, down, or right.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,4), which is the edge of the board. But since the coordinates range from 0 to 9, moving right from (9,4) would be out of bounds and cause me to die. So, right is not a safe move.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,4), which is towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,5), which is above my current position.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,3), below my current position.\n\nLet me think about moving left towards the apples at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), I can eat the apple there. But I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't in my way or won't intercept me.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5), which is above me. If it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (4,4). But I don't know its movement patterns.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to maneuver around the enemy snake.\n\nWait, another apple is at (0,7), which is all the way to the bottom-left corner. That might be too far to reach without risking running into walls or other snakes.\n\nSimilarly, there's an apple at (6,0), which is at the bottom, near the left side.\n\nAnd an apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should focus on the apples that are closer to my current position, which are at (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo, moving left seems like a reasonable option.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf I move left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then to (5,4), eating the apple there, and then continue to (4,4) to eat another apple.\n\nBut if the enemy snake moves down to (3,4), it might block my path or intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,5), I can try to go around the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAt (8,5), which is above my current position, there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom there, I could potentially move left towards (7,5), then down to (7,4), and then continue left towards the apples.\n\nBut that might be too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (8,3), then left towards the apple at (5,4).\n\nWait, but (5,4) is on row 4, so to get there from (8,3), I'd need to move left to (7,3), then (6,3), then (5,3), and then up to (5,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems inefficient and risky.\n\nPerhaps it's better to just move left directly towards (5,4) and (4,4).\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n1. Move left to (7,4)\n\n2. Move left to (6,4)\n\n3. Move left to (5,4), eat the apple\n\n4. Move left to (4,4), eat another apple\n\n5. Then decide where to go next\n\nBut I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (3,2), which is below and to the left.\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), and so on, down to (3,2).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path and might expose me more to the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples on my current row is the best approach.\n\nLet me think about the sequence again.\n\nI'm at (8,4).\n\nMove left to (7,4)\n\nThen left to (6,4)\n\nThen left to (5,4), eat apple\n\nThen left to (4,4), eat apple\n\nThen decide whether to go for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake during this path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider growing longer by eating the apples, which would make me harder to be boxed in by the enemy snake.\n\nBut also, a longer snake means more squares to manage, which could be risky.\n\nWait, in this game, when you eat an apple, you grow longer. So, if I eat the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, and then eating another apple at (4,4) will make me even longer.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in my way.\n\nWait, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning your snake gets longer.\n\nSo, as I move, my body extends to cover the new positions where I've been, up to the length gained from eating apples.\n\nIn this game, since multiple apples are on the board, I need to plan my path to collect as many as possible without running into myself or others.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first.\n\nI'm at (8,4), and the apples at (5,4) and (4,4) are directly to my left on the same row.\n\nSo, moving left seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves step by step.\n\nTurn 1: Move left to (7,4)\n\nTurn 2: Move left to (6,4)\n\nTurn 3: Move left to (5,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nTurn 4: Move left to (4,4), eat apple, grow longer\n\nThen, I can assess the situation and decide where to go next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (3,5), and it moves down to (3,4), it could potentially block my path if I'm moving left towards (3,4).\n\nBut I don't know the enemy snake's movement patterns or intentions.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that the enemy snake will try to block me or intercept"

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,4). There are apples at (0,7), (4,4), (6,0), (5,4), and (3,2). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,5), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to think about how to approach these apples without running into the enemy snake or myself. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer and gain a point, but if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. I'm at (7,4), and there are apples at (5,4) and (4,4) on the same row.

But I have to worry about the enemy snake moving into my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (0,7), but that's pretty far away, and I might run into the enemy or make mistakes along the way.\n\nSimilarly, going for the apple at (6,0) would require moving down and left quite a bit, which could be risky.\n\nI think the best approach is to focus on the immediate apples to my left, at (5,4) and (4,4). They're close, and I can get to them without crossing too much of the board.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves.

If I eat that apple, I'll grow longer, which might make it harder for the enemy to catch me.\n\nWait, but if I eat the apple at (5,4), I'll grow longer, meaning my tail will extend.

If the enemy is at (4,5), and it moves down to (4,4), where I'm going, that could be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I can eat the apple at (5,4), grow longer, and position myself in a way that makes it hard for the enemy to approach, that might be better.\n\nWait, another strategy could be to try to box the enemy snake if possible. But I'm not sure if that's feasible right now.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should just focus on collecting as many apples as I can quickly without worrying too much about the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to position myself between the enemy and the apples, perhaps forcing it to take a less optimal path.\n\nBut that might be too risky, especially since I don't know the enemy's behavior.\n\nI think the safest approach is to go for the closest apples and try to minimize the time spent exposed to the enemy.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,4), then to (5,4), eat the apple, then to (4,4), eat another apple.\n\nAfter that, I can look at the board again and decide whether to go for another apple or retreat to a safer area.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's position and adjust my path accordingly.\n\nGiven all that, I think my next move should be to move left to (6,4).\n\nThat way, I'm progressing towards the apples and not exposing myself unnecessarily to the enemy.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this snake game. Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. My snake is at (4,4), not (5,4) as I thought earlier. There are apples at (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), and (7,8). The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to correct my understanding of the coordinates. If the board has Y increasing upwards, then (4,4) is my position, with (4,5) being above me, (4,3) below, (3,4) to the left, and (5,4) to the right.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving left would be to (3,4), which doesn't have an apple. Wait, earlier I thought there was an apple at (4,4), but looking at the apple positions, there's an apple at (3,2), not at (4,4). Hmm, I must have misread that.\n\nLet me double-check the apple positions: (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), (7,8). So, no apple at (4,4). That changes things.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose a direction to move in, considering there's no apple at my immediate left. So, moving left to (3,4) wouldn't give me an apple.\n\nLet me consider other directions:\n\n- Right: (5,4) \u2013 no apple there either, based on the list.\n\n- Up: (4,5) \u2013 no apple.\n\n- Down: (4,3) \u2013 no apple.\n\nSo, none of the adjacent squares have apples. I need to decide which direction to move in to best position myself to get to an apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- Apples at: (0,7), (6,0), (3,2), (2,5), (7,8)\n\n- Enemy snake at: (5,7)\n\n- My position: (4,4)\n\nI should consider which apple is closest to me and plan a path to it, while being aware of the enemy's position.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- To (0,7): |4-0| + |4-7| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- To (6,0): |4-6| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (3,2): |4-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (2,5): |4-2| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (7,8): |4-7| + |4-8| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,2) and (2,5), both with a distance of 3.\n\nLet me see the paths to these apples.\n\nFirst, to (3,2):\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2). That's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,4), down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2). Also three moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (2,5):\n\nFrom (4,4), up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then left to (2,5). Three moves.\n\nAlternatively, left to (3,4), then up to (3,5), then left to (2,5). Also three moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy's position at (5,7). The enemy is relatively far from me, and its possible movements might not immediately affect me.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious not to put myself in a position where the enemy can cut off my path or box me in.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (3,2):\n\nIf I move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), the enemy is at (5,7), which is up and to the right of me.\n\nIt would have to move down and to the left to intercept me, but it's not immediately threatening.\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (2,5):\n\nIf I move up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then left to (2,5), the enemy is at (5,7), so it's below and to the left relative to the enemy.\n\nAgain, the enemy would need to move down and to the left to intercept me, which might take some time.\n\nBetween (3,2) and (2,5), both are equally distant, but perhaps (2,5) is a better choice because it's closer to the top left corner, where there's another apple at (0,7).\n\nAlternatively, going to (6,0) is also an option, but it's farther away with a distance of 6.\n\nConsidering that, perhaps focusing on (2,5) first, then moving to (0,7) would be a better strategy.\n\nBut, I need to make a decision for the next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving up to (4,5) would be a good starting point towards (2,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (3,4) would put me closer to both (3,2) and (2,5).\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then to (3,2), the enemy is at (5,7), and it might try to move down to block my path, but it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (4,5), the enemy is at (5,7), and it can move down to (5,6), then (5,5), and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't let the enemy box me in.\n\nPerhaps the safest initial move is to move left to (3,4), as it moves me away from the enemy and towards the closest apples.\n\nAdditionally, moving left doesn't bring me closer to any walls, which is good for maneuverability.\n\nLet me consider the possible enemy movements.\n\nIf the enemy moves down from (5,7) to (5,6), I can continue moving left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), and so on.\n\nThe enemy would have to make a series of moves to intercept me, and I can adjust my path accordingly.\n\nMoreover, by moving left, I'm also positioning myself to potentially go towards (2,5) or (3,2), depending on which one is less threatened by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (4,5), I'm moving closer to the enemy's row, which might not be ideal.\n\nTherefore, moving left seems like a safer and more strategic choice for now.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"
