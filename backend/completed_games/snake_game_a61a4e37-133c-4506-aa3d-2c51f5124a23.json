This should be a relatively safe move, as it moves away from the enemy snake's last known position while also bringing me closer to a potential point.\n\nAfter making this move, on the next turn, I should carefully assess the enemy snake's new position and decide whether to continue towards (6, 8) or adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nStaying flexible and avoiding potential traps will be crucial for maximizing my score.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Moving UP towards it seems like a reasonable choice, as it would put me closer to the apple while also creating some distance from the enemy snake's last known position.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's potential movement. If it has moved towards the top of the board, it could potentially block my path or put me in a dangerous position. It's important to leave myself some room to maneuver and avoid getting trapped.\n\nAnother option would be to move RIGHT towards the apple at (6, 8). This would also put me closer to an apple while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake's last known position.\n\nConsidering the potential risks and rewards, I think moving UP towards (7, 4) is the safer play for now. This should put me closer to the apple at (7, 3) while still giving me some flexibility to react to the enemy snake's movements on the next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP, I should carefully assess the position of the enemy snake and decide whether to continue moving towards (7, 3) or potentially change direction towards another apple.
