My goal is to move towards the apple at (1, 7) while being cautious of snake #1 at (1, 6) and the other apples.\n\nI've decided to move up to (8, 4) and then try to move right or left from there to get closer to the apple. However, I need to be careful not to get too close to snake #1. If I move too far to the right, I might run into it. I also need to keep an eye on the other apples, especially the one at (1, 5) and (1, 7).\n\nNow that I'm at (8, 4), I need to decide whether to move right or left. If I move right, I'll be at (9, 4), which is close to the apple at (8, 9) but also close to the wall. If I move left, I'll be at (7, 4), which is closer to the apple at (7, 3) but also closer to the wall.\n\nHmm... I think I'll move left to (7, 4) and then try to move up to get closer to the apple at (1, 7).\n\nMy next move is: LEFT."
