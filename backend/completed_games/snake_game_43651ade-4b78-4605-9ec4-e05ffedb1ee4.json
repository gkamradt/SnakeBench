Now, I need to decide on my next target while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 1), just one step diagonally down and left from my current position. However, the enemy snake's head is at (6, 4), and its body extends upwards. If I move towards the apple at (6, 1), I risk getting trapped by the enemy snake, especially if it decides to move downwards.\n\nOn the other hand, the apple at (9, 6) is further away from the enemy snake and could be a safer option. To reach it, I would need to move UP twice, then RIGHT twice. This path keeps me at a safe distance from the enemy snake while allowing me to collect points efficiently.\n\nConsidering the current board state and the enemy snake's position, targeting the apple at (9, 6) seems to be the better choice for now. It prioritizes safety while still enabling me to gain points.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\n- Move UP to (7, 3) as the first step towards reaching the apple at (9, 6).\n- Continue moving UP to (7, 4) on the following turn, maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n- Reassess the situation after each move and adjust the strategy if necessary based on the enemy snake's movements and the overall board state.\n\nNext move: UP"

Apples status:\n   - Remaining apples: (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (6, 1)\n\nStrategic Considerations:\n- The board is still open with multiple apple options\n- Enemy snake #1 is not an immediate threat\n- Need to continue efficient apple collection\n\nApple Analysis:\n- (7, 2) is relatively close\n- (6, 1) is another nearby option\n- Longer-distance apples at (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 6)\n\nMovement Strategy:\n- Move RIGHT towards (7, 2) or (6, 1) apple\n- Maintain flexible routing\n- Keep escape routes open\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- No immediate collision risks\n- Plenty of board space\n- Enemy snake is distant\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- Continue targeting nearby apples\n- Monitor board positioning\n- Keep options for future moves open\n\nRationale: Moving RIGHT allows me to potentially reach the (7, 2) or (6, 1) apple while maintaining good board control and flexibility.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
