There are apples at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). I need to navigate to these apples to grow and score points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nAnd snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 at (0,1) with no body.\n\n- Me, Snake #2 at (3,3).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions and plan a path to the apples. Since there are multiple apples, I should prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- To (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- To (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- To (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- To (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,3) is only one step down.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Down one step to (2,3), which is an apple.\n\n- From there, I can either go left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\n- Or, I can aim for other apples.\n\nBut I also need to be aware of the other snake, Snake #1 at (0,1). Since it has no body, it's just its head. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet's see where Snake #1 is and where it might be going.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,1). Possible moves for it:\n\n- Up to (0,2)\n\n- Right to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (0,0)\n\n- Left to (9,1) (since it's a wrap-around board?)\n\nWait, the rules don't specify if the board wraps around. It says \"run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates)\", so probably no wrap-around. So, if Snake #1 goes left from (0,1), it would hit the left wall and die.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can safely move up or right or down.\n\nSimilarly, I need to plan my path without hitting it.\n\nBut since Snake #1 is at (0,1) and I'm at (3,3), and the apples are at (2,2), (2,3), etc., it seems for now, Snake #1 is not immediately threatening me.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), I can move left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nBut I need to plan further ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) and (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be longer.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of Snake #1 and avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, if Snake #1 moves in a way that blocks my path, I need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, let's assume Snake #1 doesn't immediately interfere.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1), but that's quite a distance.\n\nAlternatively, look for closer apples.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), which is down 3 and right 3 from (3,3).\n\nBut there are apples at (6,1) and (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps try to group the apples together.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2) and (2,3) are close together.\n\n- (6,1) and (6,9) are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0) is alone.\n\nSo, maybe focus on the cluster at (2,2) and (2,3) first.\n\nAfter eating those, I can decide whether to go for (6,1) or (8,0).\n\n(6,9) is far away, and going there might expose me to risks.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize (2,2), (2,3), then (6,1), then (8,0).\n\nAs for Snake #1, I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the first few moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, maybe down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2) wouldn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps go down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), but that's not near any apple.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the board as a graph and find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think in terms of which apple is closest and go for that.\n\nGiven that, (2,3) is right below me, so that's the easiest to reach.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), so from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), I can move down to (5,2), but that's not directly towards (6,1).\n\nMaybe it's better to aim directly for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nSo, from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then right to (6,1).\n\nBut that's a long path and increases the risk of running into Snake #1 or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (7,2), then right to (7,0), then down to (8,0).\n\nBut that still seems too far.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the apple at (6,1) after (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider just going for (2,2) and (2,3), then see what's next.\n\nAfter all, in a multi-apple snake game, it's often better to grab the closest apples first to grow quickly and avoid being blocked by your own body.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1).\n\nBut wait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2) would require passing through areas where Snake #1 might be.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to move right to (2,5), but there's no apple there.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (6,1) as my next target after (2,2).\n\nTo get"

Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1). That's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different route.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat's three steps down, then right, then down.\n\nBut I need to consider if that path is clear and if Snake #1 might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) directly by moving right to (2,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,3). There are apples at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). I need to navigate to these apples to grow and score points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nAnd snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 at (0,1) with no body.\n\n- Me, Snake #2 at (3,3).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions and plan a path to the apples. Since there are multiple apples, I should prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- To (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- To (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- To (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- To (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,3) is only one step down.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Down one step to (2,3), which is an apple.\n\n- From there, I can either go left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\n- Or, I can aim for other apples.\n\nBut I also need to be aware of the other snake, Snake #1 at (0,1). Since it has no body, it's just its head. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet's see where Snake #1 is and where it might be going.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,1). Possible moves for it:\n\n- Up to (0,2)\n\n- Right to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (0,0)\n\n- Left to (9,1) (since it's a wrap-around board?)\n\nWait, the rules don't specify if the board wraps around. It says \"run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates)\", so probably no wrap-around. So, if Snake #1 goes left from (0,1), it would hit the left wall and die.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can safely move up or right or down.\n\nSimilarly, I need to plan my path without hitting it.\n\nBut since Snake #1 is at (0,1) and I'm at (3,3), and the apples are at (2,2), (2,3), etc., it seems for now, Snake #1 is not immediately threatening me.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), I can move left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nBut I need to plan further ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) and (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be longer.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of Snake #1 and avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, if Snake #1 moves in a way that blocks my path, I need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, let's assume Snake #1 doesn't immediately interfere.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1), but that's quite a distance.\n\nAlternatively, look for closer apples.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), which is down 3 and right 3 from (3,3).\n\nBut there are apples at (6,1) and (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps try to group the apples together.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2) and (2,3) are close together.\n\n- (6,1) and (6,9) are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0) is alone.\n\nSo, maybe focus on the cluster at (2,2) and (2,3) first.\n\nAfter eating those, I can decide whether to go for (6,1) or (8,0).\n\n(6,9) is far away, and going there might expose me to risks.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize (2,2), (2,3), then (6,1), then (8,0).\n\nAs for Snake #1, I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the first few moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, maybe down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2) wouldn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps go down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), but that's not near any apple.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the board as a graph and find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think in terms of which apple is closest and go for that.\n\nGiven that, (2,3) is right below me, so that's the easiest to reach.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), so from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), I can move down to (5,2), but that's not directly towards (6,1).\n\nMaybe it's better to aim directly for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nSo, from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then right to (6,1).\n\nBut that's a long path and increases the risk of running into Snake #1 or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (7,2), then right to (7,0), then down to (8,0).\n\nBut that still seems too far.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the apple at (6,1) after (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider just going for (2,2) and (2,3), then see what's next.\n\nAfter all, in a multi-apple snake game, it's often better to grab the closest apples first to grow quickly and avoid being blocked by your own body.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1).\n\nBut wait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2) would require passing through areas where Snake #1 might be.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to move right to (2,5), but there's no apple there.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (6,1) as my next target after (2,2).\n\nTo get"

Enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,2) with no body.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board correctly. Rows increase from bottom to top, so row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top. Columns increase from left to right, from 0 to 9.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, Snake #2 is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3. Apples are at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path to these apples, starting with the closest ones.\n\nFirst, calculate distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,3), just one step down.\n\nThen, from there, I can go to (2,2), which is adjacent.\n\nAfter that, I might consider moving towards (6,1), but that's a bit far. Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat's three steps down, then right, then down.\n\nBut I need to consider if that path is clear and if Snake #1 might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize eating as many apples as possible in the shortest path.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (2,3), then left to (2,2). So, two steps to eat two apples.\n\nThen, perhaps aim for (6,1), which is down 4 and right 4.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I need to make sure my path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (8,0), which is down 6 and right 6 from (2,2).\n\nThat seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to group the apples.\n\nBut given the positions, they are spread out.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to eat (2,3) and (2,2), then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, my snake will have grown, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, by then, Snake #1 might have moved closer, so I need to keep an eye on its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat would be a path of 4 steps: down, down, right, down.\n\nI need to make sure that Snake #1 isn't in my way.\n\nLooking at Snake #1's possible moves, if it moves up from (0,2) to (0,3), then to (0,4), and so on, it might not interfere with my path.\n\nBut I need to consider that Snake #1 could also move right or down.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), then to (2,2), but by that time, I would have already eaten (2,2), so it might not be able to reach me.\n\nMoreover, after I eat (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nSo, Snake #1 would need to navigate around my body.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a position where Snake #1 can cut me off.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just proceed with the initial plan: down to (2,3), then left to (2,2), and assess from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider going for (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (6,3), then left to (6,1).\n\nBut that's down 3, left 2, totaling 5 steps.\n\nCompared to going for the closer apples first, I'd prefer the closer apples.\n\nMoreover, by going for the closer apples first, I can grow faster and secure those points sooner.\n\nSo, my decision is to go for (2,3) first, then (2,2), then reassess.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (2,3).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,3). There are apples at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). I need to navigate to these apples to grow and score points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nAnd snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 at (0,1) with no body.\n\n- Me, Snake #2 at (3,3).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions and plan a path to the apples. Since there are multiple apples, I should prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- To (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- To (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- To (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- To (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,3) is only one step down.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Down one step to (2,3), which is an apple.\n\n- From there, I can either go left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\n- Or, I can aim for other apples.\n\nBut I also need to be aware of the other snake, Snake #1 at (0,1). Since it has no body, it's just its head. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet's see where Snake #1 is and where it might be going.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,1). Possible moves for it:\n\n- Up to (0,2)\n\n- Right to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (0,0)\n\n- Left to (9,1) (since it's a wrap-around board?)\n\nWait, the rules don't specify if the board wraps around. It says \"run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates)\", so probably no wrap-around. So, if Snake #1 goes left from (0,1), it would hit the left wall and die.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can safely move up or right or down.\n\nSimilarly, I need to plan my path without hitting it.\n\nBut since Snake #1 is at (0,1) and I'm at (3,3), and the apples are at (2,2), (2,3), etc., it seems for now, Snake #1 is not immediately threatening me.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), I can move left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nBut I need to plan further ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) and (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be longer.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of Snake #1 and avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, if Snake #1 moves in a way that blocks my path, I need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, let's assume Snake #1 doesn't immediately interfere.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1), but that's quite a distance.\n\nAlternatively, look for closer apples.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), which is down 3 and right 3 from (3,3).\n\nBut there are apples at (6,1) and (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps try to group the apples together.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2) and (2,3) are close together.\n\n- (6,1) and (6,9) are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0) is alone.\n\nSo, maybe focus on the cluster at (2,2) and (2,3) first.\n\nAfter eating those, I can decide whether to go for (6,1) or (8,0).\n\n(6,9) is far away, and going there might expose me to risks.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize (2,2), (2,3), then (6,1), then (8,0).\n\nAs for Snake #1, I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the first few moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, maybe down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2) wouldn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps go down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), but that's not near any apple.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the board as a graph and find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think in terms of which apple is closest and go for that.\n\nGiven that, (2,3) is right below me, so that's the easiest to reach.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), so from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), I can move down to (5,2), but that's not directly towards (6,1).\n\nMaybe it's better to aim directly for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nSo, from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then right to (6,1).\n\nBut that's a long path and increases the risk of running into Snake #1 or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (7,2), then right to (7,0), then down to (8,0).\n\nBut that still seems too far.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the apple at (6,1) after (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider just going for (2,2) and (2,3), then see what's next.\n\nAfter all, in a multi-apple snake game, it's often better to grab the closest apples first to grow quickly and avoid being blocked by your own body.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1).\n\nBut wait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2) would require passing through areas where Snake #1 might be.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to move right to (2,5), but there's no apple there.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (6,1) as my next target after (2,2).\n\nTo get"

So, if Snake #2 is at (3,3), that should be row 3, column 3.\n\nApples are located at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). Enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,2) with no body.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board correctly. Rows increase from bottom to top, so row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top. Columns increase from left to right, from 0 to 9.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, Snake #2 is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3. Apples are at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path to these apples, starting with the closest ones.\n\nFirst, calculate distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,3), just one step down.\n\nThen, from there, I can go to (2,2), which is adjacent.\n\nAfter that, I might consider moving towards (6,1), but that's a bit far. Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat's three steps down, then right, then down.\n\nBut I need to consider if that path is clear and if Snake #1 might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize eating as many apples as possible in the shortest path.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (2,3), then left to (2,2). So, two steps to eat two apples.\n\nThen, perhaps aim for (6,1), which is down 4 and right 4.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I need to make sure my path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (8,0), which is down 6 and right 6 from (2,2).\n\nThat seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to group the apples.\n\nBut given the positions, they are spread out.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to eat (2,3) and (2,2), then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, my snake will have grown, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, by then, Snake #1 might have moved closer, so I need to keep an eye on its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat would be a path of 4 steps: down, down, right, down.\n\nI need to make sure that Snake #1 isn't in my way.\n\nLooking at Snake #1's possible moves, if it moves up from (0,2) to (0,3), then to (0,4), and so on, it might not interfere with my path.\n\nBut I need to consider that Snake #1 could also move right or down.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), then to (2,2), but by that time, I would have already eaten (2,2), so it might not be able to reach me.\n\nMoreover, after I eat (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nSo, Snake #1 would need to navigate around my body.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a position where Snake #1 can cut me off.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just proceed with the initial plan: down to (2,3), then left to (2,2), and assess from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider going for (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (6,3), then left to (6,1).\n\nBut that's down 3, left 2, totaling 5 steps.\n\nCompared to going for the closer apples first, I'd prefer the closer apples.\n\nMoreover, by going for the closer apples first, I can grow faster and secure those points sooner.\n\nSo, my decision is to go for (2,3) first, then (2,2), then reassess.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (2,3).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nDOWN"

Let's see the current setup.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is at position (4,1). Wait, in the initial information, it says my snake is at (4,1), but in the board state, it shows Snake #2 at (3,3). There's a discrepancy here. Let me double-check the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . .

So, my head is at (3,3). But earlier it was mentioned I'm at (4,1). Maybe there's a mistake in the coordinates. I need to go by the board state.\n\nSo, my snake head is at (3,3). Apples are at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). Enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,4) with no body.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the coordinate system. Rows increase from bottom to top, so row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top. Columns increase from left to right, from 0 to 9.\n\nLet me sketch this out for clarity:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . A . . . (apples at (6,9))\n\n- Row 8: all dots\n\n- Row 7: all dots\n\n- Row 6: all dots\n\n- Row 5: all dots\n\n- Row 4: 1 . . . . . . . . . (Snake #1 at (0,4))\n\n- Row 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .

(apple at (8,0))\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my head is at (3,3). I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3)\n\n- Right: (4,3)\n\nI need to avoid walls, other snakes, and myself. Currently, I only have my head, so no need to worry about my body yet.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. Up: (3,4) - looking at row 3, column 4. From the board, it's a dot, so it's safe.\n\n2. Down: (3,2) - row 3, column 2. There's an apple at (2,3), but wait, apple is at (2,2). Wait, no, apple at (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. So, (3,2) is a dot, safe.\n\n3. Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3. Looking at row 2, it's a dot, safe.\n\n4. Right: (4,3) - row 4, column 3. Looking at row 4, it's a dot, safe.\n\nWait, but in row 3, column 3, it's '2', which is me. Row 3, column 2 has an 'A' - wait, no, the apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with rows and columns. Let's clarify:\n\n- My head is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3.\n\n- Apples are at:\n\n- (2,2): row 2, column 2\n\n- (2,3): row 2, column 3\n\n- (6,1): row 6, column 1\n\n- (6,9): row 6, column 9\n\n- (8,0): row 8, column 0\n\nSo, from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4), which is row 3, column 4\n\n- Down: (3,2), which is row 3, column 2\n\n- Left: (2,3), which is row 2, column 3 (apple is at (2,3))\n\n- Right: (4,3), which is row 4, column 3\n\nNow, row 2, column 3 has an apple, so moving left would eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 2 has another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim to eat the apple at (2,3) first, then proceed to (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat the apple there, and my body grows. So, my tail will stay where it was, but since I just started, I only have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, since I'm just starting, moving to (2,3) and eating the apple will make my body stay at (3,3), but in reality, my body will extend, so I need to make sure I don't immediately turn back.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, I don't have a body yet beyond my head.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3), eating the apple, now my tail is at (3,3), and my head is at (2,3).\n\nNext, I can move left to (1,3), but there's no apple there. Or down to (2,2), which has an apple.\n\nSo, perhaps moving down from (2,3) to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from there, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (1,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 2, column 2 has an apple.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) would be picking up another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet's see the distances from (2,2) to other apples:\n\n- (6,1): down 4, right 5 \u2192 total 9 steps\n\n- (6,9): down 4, right 7 \u2192 total 11 steps\n\n- (8,0): down 6, right 2 \u2192 total 8 steps\n\nSo, (8,0) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), then left to (8,1), then (8,0).\n\nThat's 6 down and 2 left, total 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1):\n\nFrom (2,2), down to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's 4 down and 1 left, total 5 steps.\n\nThat seems shorter than going to (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,2), go to (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,1), I can aim for (6,9), but that's far.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,1), go to (8,0).\n\nWait, from (6,1), to (8,0), that's down 2, right 9, wrapping around, but the board doesn't wrap, so it's down 2, right 9, which is off the board.\n\nWait, no, the board is 10x10, so right 9 from column 1 is column 10, which is off the board.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it says coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9), and running into coordinates outside that range means hitting the wall.\n\nSo, from (6,1), moving right to (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,9), then (6,10), which is off the board.\n\nSo, to get to (8,0), from (6,1), I would need to move down to (7,1), (8,1), then left to (8,0).\n\nThat's 2 down and 1 left, total 3 steps.\n\nSo, from"

There are apples at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). I need to navigate to these apples to grow and score points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nAnd snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 at (0,1) with no body.\n\n- Me, Snake #2 at (3,3).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions and plan a path to the apples. Since there are multiple apples, I should prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- To (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- To (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- To (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- To (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,3) is only one step down.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Down one step to (2,3), which is an apple.\n\n- From there, I can either go left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\n- Or, I can aim for other apples.\n\nBut I also need to be aware of the other snake, Snake #1 at (0,1). Since it has no body, it's just its head. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet's see where Snake #1 is and where it might be going.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,1). Possible moves for it:\n\n- Up to (0,2)\n\n- Right to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (0,0)\n\n- Left to (9,1) (since it's a wrap-around board?)\n\nWait, the rules don't specify if the board wraps around. It says \"run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates)\", so probably no wrap-around. So, if Snake #1 goes left from (0,1), it would hit the left wall and die.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can safely move up or right or down.\n\nSimilarly, I need to plan my path without hitting it.\n\nBut since Snake #1 is at (0,1) and I'm at (3,3), and the apples are at (2,2), (2,3), etc., it seems for now, Snake #1 is not immediately threatening me.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), I can move left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nBut I need to plan further ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) and (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be longer.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of Snake #1 and avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, if Snake #1 moves in a way that blocks my path, I need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, let's assume Snake #1 doesn't immediately interfere.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1), but that's quite a distance.\n\nAlternatively, look for closer apples.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), which is down 3 and right 3 from (3,3).\n\nBut there are apples at (6,1) and (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps try to group the apples together.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2) and (2,3) are close together.\n\n- (6,1) and (6,9) are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0) is alone.\n\nSo, maybe focus on the cluster at (2,2) and (2,3) first.\n\nAfter eating those, I can decide whether to go for (6,1) or (8,0).\n\n(6,9) is far away, and going there might expose me to risks.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize (2,2), (2,3), then (6,1), then (8,0).\n\nAs for Snake #1, I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the first few moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, maybe down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2) wouldn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps go down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), but that's not near any apple.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the board as a graph and find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think in terms of which apple is closest and go for that.\n\nGiven that, (2,3) is right below me, so that's the easiest to reach.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), so from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), I can move down to (5,2), but that's not directly towards (6,1).\n\nMaybe it's better to aim directly for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nSo, from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then right to (6,1).\n\nBut that's a long path and increases the risk of running into Snake #1 or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (7,2), then right to (7,0), then down to (8,0).\n\nBut that still seems too far.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the apple at (6,1) after (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider just going for (2,2) and (2,3), then see what's next.\n\nAfter all, in a multi-apple snake game, it's often better to grab the closest apples first to grow quickly and avoid being blocked by your own body.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1).\n\nBut wait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2) would require passing through areas where Snake #1 might be.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to move right to (2,5), but there's no apple there.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (6,1) as my next target after (2,2).\n\nTo get"

Let's see the current setup.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is at position (4, 3). Wait, in the board state, it shows Snake #2 at position (3,3), but in the initial information, it says (4,3). I need to clarify that. Looking back, the board has rows and columns labeled from 0 to 9, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, if Snake #2 is at (3,3), that should be row 3, column 3.\n\nApples are located at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). Enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,2) with no body.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board correctly. Rows increase from bottom to top, so row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top. Columns increase from left to right, from 0 to 9.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . .

Apples are at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path to these apples, starting with the closest ones.\n\nFirst, calculate distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,3), just one step down.\n\nThen, from there, I can go to (2,2), which is adjacent.\n\nAfter that, I might consider moving towards (6,1), but that's a bit far. Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1). That's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different route.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat's three steps down, then right, then down.\n\nBut I need to consider if that path is clear and if Snake #1 might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) directly by moving right to (2,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1). But that still seems inefficient.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,2) and (2,3), then see the board again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should prioritize eating as many apples as possible in the shortest path.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (2,3), then left to (2,2). So, two steps to eat two apples.\n\nThen, perhaps aim for (6,1), which is down 4 and right 4.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I need to make sure my path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (8,0), which is down 6 and right 6 from (2,2).\n\nThat seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to group the apples.\n\nBut given the positions, they are spread out.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to eat (2,3) and (2,2), then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, my snake will have grown, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, by then, Snake #1 might have moved closer, so I need to keep an eye on its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat would be a path of 4 steps: down, down, right, down.\n\nI need to make sure that Snake #1 isn't in my way.\n\nLooking at Snake #1's possible moves, if it moves up from (0,2) to (0,3), then to (0,4), and so on, it might not interfere with my path.\n\nBut I need to consider that Snake #1 could also move right or down.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), then to (2,2), but by that time, I would have already eaten (2,2), so it might not be able to reach me.\n\nMoreover, after I eat (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nSo, Snake #1 would need to navigate around my body.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a position where Snake #1 can cut me off.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just proceed with the initial plan: down to (2,3), then left to (2,2), and assess from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (6,3), then left to (6,1).\n\nBut that's down 3, left 2, totaling 5 steps.\n\nCompared to going for (2,3) and (2,2), which is only 2 steps, I'd prefer the closer apples.\n\nMoreover, by going for the closer apples first, I can grow faster and secure those points sooner.\n\nSo, my decision is to go for (2,3) first, then (2,2), then reassess.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (2,3).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nDOWN"

Down: (3,2) - row 3, column 2. There's an apple at (2,3), but wait, apple is at (2,2). Wait, no, apple at (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. So, (3,2) is a dot, safe.\n\n3. Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3.

Row 3, column 2 has an 'A' - wait, no, the apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with rows and columns. Let's clarify:\n\n- My head is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3.\n\n- Apples are at:\n\n- (2,2): row 2, column 2\n\n- (2,3): row 2, column 3\n\n- (6,1): row 6, column 1\n\n- (6,9): row 6, column 9\n\n- (8,0): row 8, column 0\n\nSo, from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4), which is row 3, column 4\n\n- Down: (3,2), which is row 3, column 2\n\n- Left: (2,3), which is row 2, column 3 (apple is at (2,3))\n\n- Right: (4,3), which is row 4, column 3\n\nNow, row 2, column 3 has an apple, so moving left would eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 2 has another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim to eat the apple at (2,3) first, then proceed to (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat the apple there, and my body grows. So, my tail will stay where it was, but since I just started, I only have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, since I'm just starting, moving to (2,3) and eating the apple will make my body stay at (3,3), but in reality, my body will extend, so I need to make sure I don't immediately turn back.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, I don't have a body yet beyond my head.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3), eating the apple, now my tail is at (3,3), and my head is at (2,3).\n\nNext, I can move left to (1,3), but there's no apple there. Or down to (2,2), which has an apple.\n\nSo, perhaps moving down from (2,3) to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from there, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (1,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 2, column 2 has an apple.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) would be picking up another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet's see the distances from (2,2) to other apples:\n\n- (6,1): down 4, right 5 \u2192 total 9 steps\n\n- (6,9): down 4, right 7 \u2192 total 11 steps\n\n- (8,0): down 6, right 2 \u2192 total 8 steps\n\nSo, (8,0) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), then left to (8,1), then (8,0).\n\nThat's 6 down and 2 left, total 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1):\n\nFrom (2,2), down to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's 4 down and 1 left, total 5 steps.\n\nThat seems shorter than going to (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,2), go to (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,1), I can aim for (6,9), but that's far.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,1), go to (8,0).\n\nWait, from (6,1), to (8,0), that's down 2, right 9, wrapping around, but the board doesn't wrap, so it's down 2, right 9, which is off the board.\n\nWait, no, the board is 10x10, so right 9 from column 1 is column 10, which is off the board.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it says coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9), and running into coordinates outside that range means hitting the wall.\n\nSo, from (6,1), moving right to (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,9), then (6,10), which is off the board.\n\nSo, to get to (8,0), from (6,1), I would need to move down to (7,1), (8,1), then left to (8,0).\n\nThat's 2 down and 1 left, total 3 steps.\n\nSo, from"

Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3. There's an apple here.\n\n4. Right: (4,3) - row 4, column 3. It's a dot, safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3) would allow me to eat an apple, which is good because I gain a point and grow in length.\n\nBut I need to think ahead. After eating the apple at (2,3), my tail will stay where it was, but since I'm just starting, I only have one segment. So, after eating the apple, I have two segments: head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, I need to decide where to move from (2,3). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2) (another apple)\n\n- Left: (1,3)\n\n- Right: (3,3) (my tail)\n\nMoving right to (3,3) would be hitting my tail, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple is a good idea.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I would have three segments: head at (2,2), middle at (2,3), and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple. The closest seems to be (6,1), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is even farther, and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the movement of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0,4) with no body. I don't know its direction, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (6,1).\n\nSo, from (2,2):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\n- Left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that the path is clear and that I don't grow too large to maneuver.\n\nWait, actually, as I eat apples, my length increases, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet's think about the body trail:\n\n- After eating (2,3), body is at (3,3)\n\n- After eating (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3)\n\n- After moving to (3,2), body is at (2,2), (2,3), and (3,3)\n\n- And so on.\n\nI need to keep track of my body positions to avoid running into them.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves as well.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in this path, like the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, Snake #1 is at (0,4), and if it's moving down, it might intersect with my path.\n\nBut without knowing its direction, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first to minimize exposure.\n\nLooking back, the apple at (2,3) is adjacent to my current position, so it's the closest.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look towards (6,1).\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,0), but that seems farther.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1), then down to (7,1), (8,1), left to (8,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's quite a long path, and I might be exposed to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), right to (5,2), down to (6,2), right to (6,3), and so on.\n\nThis seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different strategy: prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3): these are adjacent.\n\n- (6,1), (6,9): these are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0): isolated.\n\nSo, perhaps eat (2,3), then (2,2), then move to (6,1), then (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (6,1) to (6,9) is risky because it's a long horizontal move, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,1), I could move up or down to position myself better for the next apple.\n\nWait, perhaps after eating (6,1), I can move up to (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), then left to (0,0), then down to (1,0), (2,0), ..., (8,0) to eat the apple at (8,0).\n\nBut that's a very long path and increases the risk of collision.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples in a different order.\n\nLet me think differently: calculate the Manhattan distances between all apples and plan a path that minimizes total movement.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nStarting from (3,3):\n\n- Closest apples are (2,3) and (2,2), both one step away.\n\n- Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\n- From (2,2), the next closest apple is"

There are apples at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). I need to navigate to these apples to grow and score points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nAnd snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 at (0,1) with no body.\n\n- Me, Snake #2 at (3,3).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions and plan a path to the apples. Since there are multiple apples, I should prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- To (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- To (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- To (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- To (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,3) is only one step down.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Down one step to (2,3), which is an apple.\n\n- From there, I can either go left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\n- Or, I can aim for other apples.\n\nBut I also need to be aware of the other snake, Snake #1 at (0,1). Since it has no body, it's just its head. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet's see where Snake #1 is and where it might be going.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,1). Possible moves for it:\n\n- Up to (0,2)\n\n- Right to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (0,0)\n\n- Left to (9,1) (since it's a wrap-around board?)\n\nWait, the rules don't specify if the board wraps around. It says \"run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates)\", so probably no wrap-around. So, if Snake #1 goes left from (0,1), it would hit the left wall and die.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can safely move up or right or down.\n\nSimilarly, I need to plan my path without hitting it.\n\nBut since Snake #1 is at (0,1) and I'm at (3,3), and the apples are at (2,2), (2,3), etc., it seems for now, Snake #1 is not immediately threatening me.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), I can move left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nBut I need to plan further ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) and (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be longer.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of Snake #1 and avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, if Snake #1 moves in a way that blocks my path, I need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, let's assume Snake #1 doesn't immediately interfere.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1), but that's quite a distance.\n\nAlternatively, look for closer apples.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), which is down 3 and right 3 from (3,3).\n\nBut there are apples at (6,1) and (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps try to group the apples together.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2) and (2,3) are close together.\n\n- (6,1) and (6,9) are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0) is alone.\n\nSo, maybe focus on the cluster at (2,2) and (2,3) first.\n\nAfter eating those, I can decide whether to go for (6,1) or (8,0).\n\n(6,9) is far away, and going there might expose me to risks.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize (2,2), (2,3), then (6,1), then (8,0).\n\nAs for Snake #1, I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the first few moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, maybe down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2) wouldn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps go down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), but that's not near any apple.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the board as a graph and find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think in terms of which apple is closest and go for that.\n\nGiven that, (2,3) is right below me, so that's the easiest to reach.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), so from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), I can move down to (5,2), but that's not directly towards (6,1).\n\nMaybe it's better to aim directly for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nSo, from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then right to (6,1).\n\nBut that's a long path and increases the risk of running into Snake #1 or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (7,2), then right to (7,0), then down to (8,0).\n\nBut that still seems too far.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the apple at (6,1) after (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider just going for (2,2) and (2,3), then see what's next.\n\nAfter all, in a multi-apple snake game, it's often better to grab the closest apples first to grow quickly and avoid being blocked by your own body.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1).\n\nBut wait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2) would require passing through areas where Snake #1 might be.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to move right to (2,5), but there's no apple there.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (6,1) as my next target after (2,2).\n\nTo get"

I need to clarify that. Looking back, the board has rows and columns labeled from 0 to 9, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right.

Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).

A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, Snake #2 is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3. Apples are at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path to these apples, starting with the closest ones.\n\nFirst, calculate distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,3), just one step down.\n\nThen, from there, I can go to (2,2), which is adjacent.\n\nAfter that, I might consider moving towards (6,1), but that's a bit far. Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat's three steps down, then right, then down.\n\nBut I need to consider if that path is clear and if Snake #1 might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize eating as many apples as possible in the shortest path.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (2,3), then left to (2,2). So, two steps to eat two apples.\n\nThen, perhaps aim for (6,1), which is down 4 and right 4.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I need to make sure my path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (8,0), which is down 6 and right 6 from (2,2).\n\nThat seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to group the apples.\n\nBut given the positions, they are spread out.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to eat (2,3) and (2,2), then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, my snake will have grown, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, by then, Snake #1 might have moved closer, so I need to keep an eye on its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat would be a path of 4 steps: down, down, right, down.\n\nI need to make sure that Snake #1 isn't in my way.\n\nLooking at Snake #1's possible moves, if it moves up from (0,2) to (0,3), then to (0,4), and so on, it might not interfere with my path.\n\nBut I need to consider that Snake #1 could also move right or down.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), then to (2,2), but by that time, I would have already eaten (2,2), so it might not be able to reach me.\n\nMoreover, after I eat (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nSo, Snake #1 would need to navigate around my body.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a position where Snake #1 can cut me off.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just proceed with the initial plan: down to (2,3), then left to (2,2), and assess from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider going for (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (6,3), then left to (6,1).\n\nBut that's down 3, left 2, totaling 5 steps.\n\nCompared to going for the closer apples first, I'd prefer the closer apples.\n\nMoreover, by going for the closer apples first, I can grow faster and secure those points sooner.\n\nSo, my decision is to go for (2,3) first, then (2,2), then reassess.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (2,3).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nDOWN"

Currently, I only have my head, so no need to worry about my body yet.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. Up: (3,4) - looking at row 3, column 4. From the board, it's a dot, so it's safe.\n\n2. Down: (3,2) - row 3, column 2. There's an apple at (2,3), but wait, apple is at (2,2). Wait, no, apple at (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. So, (3,2) is a dot, safe.\n\n3. Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3. Looking at row 2, it's a dot, safe.\n\n4. Right: (4,3) - row 4, column 3. Looking at row 4, it's a dot, safe.\n\nWait, but in row 3, column 3, it's '2', which is me. Row 3, column 2 has an 'A' - wait, no, the apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with rows and columns. Let's clarify:\n\n- My head is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3.\n\n- Apples are at:\n\n- (2,2): row 2, column 2\n\n- (2,3): row 2, column 3\n\n- (6,1): row 6, column 1\n\n- (6,9): row 6, column 9\n\n- (8,0): row 8, column 0\n\nSo, from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4), which is row 3, column 4\n\n- Down: (3,2), which is row 3, column 2\n\n- Left: (2,3), which is row 2, column 3 (apple is at (2,3))\n\n- Right: (4,3), which is row 4, column 3\n\nNow, row 2, column 3 has an apple, so moving left would eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 2 has another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim to eat the apple at (2,3) first, then proceed to (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat the apple there, and my body grows. So, my tail will stay where it was, but since I just started, I only have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, since I'm just starting, moving to (2,3) and eating the apple will make my body stay at (3,3), but in reality, my body will extend, so I need to make sure I don't immediately turn back.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, I don't have a body yet beyond my head.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3), eating the apple, now my tail is at (3,3), and my head is at (2,3).\n\nNext, I can move left to (1,3), but there's no apple there. Or down to (2,2), which has an apple.\n\nSo, perhaps moving down from (2,3) to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from there, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (1,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 2, column 2 has an apple.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) would be picking up another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet's see the distances from (2,2) to other apples:\n\n- (6,1): down 4, right 5 \u2192 total 9 steps\n\n- (6,9): down 4, right 7 \u2192 total 11 steps\n\n- (8,0): down 6, right 2 \u2192 total 8 steps\n\nSo, (8,0) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), then left to (8,1), then (8,0).\n\nThat's 6 down and 2 left, total 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1):\n\nFrom (2,2), down to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's 4 down and 1 left, total 5 steps.\n\nThat seems shorter than going to (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,2), go to (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,1), I can aim for (6,9), but that's far.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,1), go to (8,0).\n\nWait, from (6,1), to (8,0), that's down 2, right 9, wrapping around, but the board doesn't wrap, so it's down 2, right 9, which is off the board.\n\nWait, no, the board is 10x10, so right 9 from column 1 is column 10, which is off the board.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it says coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9), and running into coordinates outside that range means hitting the wall.\n\nSo, from (6,1), moving right to (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,9), then (6,10), which is off the board.\n\nSo, to get to (8,0), from (6,1), I would need to move down to (7,1), (8,1), then left to (8,0).\n\nThat's 2 down and 1 left, total 3 steps.\n\nSo, from"

Down: (3,2) - row 3, column 2. There's an apple at (2,3), but that's in a different position. Wait, apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3. So, (3,2) is a dot, safe.\n\n3. Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3. There's an apple here.\n\n4. Right: (4,3) - row 4, column 3. It's a dot, safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3) would allow me to eat an apple, which is good because I gain a point and grow in length.\n\nBut I need to think ahead. After eating the apple at (2,3), my tail will stay where it was, but since I'm just starting, I only have one segment. So, after eating the apple, I have two segments: head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, I need to decide where to move from (2,3). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2) (another apple)\n\n- Left: (1,3)\n\n- Right: (3,3) (my tail)\n\nMoving right to (3,3) would be hitting my tail, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple is a good idea.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I would have three segments: head at (2,2), middle at (2,3), and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple. The closest seems to be (6,1), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is even farther, and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the movement of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0,4) with no body. I don't know its direction, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (6,1).\n\nSo, from (2,2):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\n- Left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that the path is clear and that I don't grow too large to maneuver.\n\nWait, actually, as I eat apples, my length increases, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet's think about the body trail:\n\n- After eating (2,3), body is at (3,3)\n\n- After eating (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3)\n\n- After moving to (3,2), body is at (2,2), (2,3), and (3,3)\n\n- And so on.\n\nI need to keep track of my body positions to avoid running into them.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves as well.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in this path, like the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, Snake #1 is at (0,4), and if it's moving down, it might intersect with my path.\n\nBut without knowing its direction, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first to minimize exposure.\n\nLooking back, the apple at (2,3) is adjacent to my current position, so it's the closest.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look towards (6,1).\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,0), but that seems farther.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1), then down to (7,1), (8,1), left to (8,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's quite a long path, and I might be exposed to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), right to (5,2), down to (6,2), right to (6,3), and so on.\n\nThis seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different strategy: prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3): these are adjacent.\n\n- (6,1), (6,9): these are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0): isolated.\n\nSo, perhaps eat (2,3), then (2,2), then move to (6,1), then (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (6,1) to (6,9) is risky because it's a long horizontal move, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,1), I could move up or down to position myself better for the next apple.\n\nWait, perhaps after eating (6,1), I can move up to (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), then left to (0,0), then down to (1,0), (2,0), ..., (8,0) to eat the apple at (8,0).\n\nBut that's a very long path and increases the risk of collision.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples in a different order.\n\nLet me think differently: calculate the Manhattan distances between all apples and plan a path that minimizes total movement.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nStarting from (3,3):\n\n- Closest apples are (2,3) and (2,2), both one step away.\n\n- Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\n- From (2,2), the next closest apple is"

I don't know its direction or behavior, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nI should prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize exposure and reduce the risk of collisions.\n\nThe apples at (2,2) and (2,3) are adjacent, so eating them in sequence makes sense.\n\nThen, I can consider moving towards (6,1), which is somewhat in the middle of the board.\n\nAfter that, I can aim for (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (2,2) to (6,1) would require passing through areas where the enemy snake could be.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating (2,3), then (2,2), then move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), and so on, gradually making my way towards (6,1).\n\nHowever, this seems time-consuming, and I might be better off choosing a different path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (6,1) directly from (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\nThat's five moves to reach (6,1). During this time, I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nBut since I'm growing with each apple I eat, I have to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nStarting at (3,3):\n\n1. Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nNow, my body is at (3,3) (tail) and head at (2,3).\n\n2. Move down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, my body is at (2,3) and (3,3), head at (2,2).\n\n3. Move right to (3,2)\n\nNow, body is at (2,3) and (2,2), head at (3,2).\n\n4. Move down to (4,2)\n\nNow, body is at (2,3) and (3,2), head at (4,2).\n\n5. Move right to (5,2)\n\nNow, body is at (3,2) and (4,2), head at (5,2).\n\n6. Move right to (6,2)\n\nNow, body is at (4,2) and (5,2), head at (6,2).\n\n7. Move left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, body is at (5,2) and (6,2), head at (6,1).\n\n8. Move up to (6,2)\n\nNow, body is at (6,2) and (6,1), head at (6,2). But this is my own body, so invalid.\n\nWait, I need to be careful not to move into my own body.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,1), my tail will be at (5,2), and head at (6,1).\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), that's where my tail is, which is now moved forward.\n\nWait, snake movement: when you move, the tail follows, so after moving to (6,1), the tail is at (6,2).\n\nWait, no. In snake games, typically, the tail moves to where the second-last segment was, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that after eating an apple, my tail stays where it was, but in reality, all segments move forward, and the tail stays where the previous tail was.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider using a simple pathfinding approach, like BFS, to find paths to apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut perhaps that's too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nGiven that, from (3,3), the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2), both one move away.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3) to eat the apple makes sense.\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, from (2,2), the next closest apple is (6,1), which is 4 units down and 4 units right.\n\nBut I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is farther up and to the right.\n\nBut (6,1) seems more immediate.\n\nSo, from (2,2), I can move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nDuring this time, I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nGiven that Snake #1 is at (0,6), and assuming it moves down, it could potentially reach (0,2) in 4 moves, but I would have moved right by then.\n\nIt's hard to predict its exact path without knowing its behavior.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could aim for (6,1), but I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, let's think about my body positions.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), my body is at (3,3).\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (3,2), body is at (2,3) and (2,2).\n\nThen, down to (4,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,2).\n\nThen, right to (5,2), body at (3,2) and (4,2).\n\nThen, right to (6,2), body at (4,2) and (5,2).\n\nThen, left to (6,1) to eat the apple, body at (5,2) and (6,2).\n\nThis seems okay, no collisions with myself.\n\nNext, from (6,1), I can move up to (6,2), but that's where my tail was, which has already moved forward.\n\nWait, in snake games, all segments move forward simultaneously.\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), the tail moves from (6,2) to where the previous tail was.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that after eating an apple,"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,3). There are apples at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). I need to navigate to these apples to grow and score points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nAnd snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 at (0,1) with no body.\n\n- Me, Snake #2 at (3,3).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions and plan a path to the apples. Since there are multiple apples, I should prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- To (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- To (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- To (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- To (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,3) is only one step down.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Down one step to (2,3), which is an apple.\n\n- From there, I can either go left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\n- Or, I can aim for other apples.\n\nBut I also need to be aware of the other snake, Snake #1 at (0,1). Since it has no body, it's just its head. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet's see where Snake #1 is and where it might be going.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,1). Possible moves for it:\n\n- Up to (0,2)\n\n- Right to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (0,0)\n\n- Left to (9,1) (since it's a wrap-around board?)\n\nWait, the rules don't specify if the board wraps around. It says \"run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates)\", so probably no wrap-around. So, if Snake #1 goes left from (0,1), it would hit the left wall and die.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can safely move up or right or down.\n\nSimilarly, I need to plan my path without hitting it.\n\nBut since Snake #1 is at (0,1) and I'm at (3,3), and the apples are at (2,2), (2,3), etc., it seems for now, Snake #1 is not immediately threatening me.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), I can move left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nBut I need to plan further ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) and (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be longer.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of Snake #1 and avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, if Snake #1 moves in a way that blocks my path, I need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, let's assume Snake #1 doesn't immediately interfere.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1), but that's quite a distance.\n\nAlternatively, look for closer apples.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), which is down 3 and right 3 from (3,3).\n\nBut there are apples at (6,1) and (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps try to group the apples together.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2) and (2,3) are close together.\n\n- (6,1) and (6,9) are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0) is alone.\n\nSo, maybe focus on the cluster at (2,2) and (2,3) first.\n\nAfter eating those, I can decide whether to go for (6,1) or (8,0).\n\n(6,9) is far away, and going there might expose me to risks.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize (2,2), (2,3), then (6,1), then (8,0).\n\nAs for Snake #1, I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the first few moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, maybe down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2) wouldn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps go down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), but that's not near any apple.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the board as a graph and find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think in terms of which apple is closest and go for that.\n\nGiven that, (2,3) is right below me, so that's the easiest to reach.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), so from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), I can move down to (5,2), but that's not directly towards (6,1).\n\nMaybe it's better to aim directly for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nSo, from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then right to (6,1).\n\nBut that's a long path and increases the risk of running into Snake #1 or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (7,2), then right to (7,0), then down to (8,0).\n\nBut that still seems too far.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the apple at (6,1) after (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider just going for (2,2) and (2,3), then see what's next.\n\nAfter all, in a multi-apple snake game, it's often better to grab the closest apples first to grow quickly and avoid being blocked by your own body.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1).\n\nBut wait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2) would require passing through areas where Snake #1 might be.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to move right to (2,5), but there's no apple there.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (6,1) as my next target after (2,2).\n\nTo get"

Let's see the current setup.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is at position (4, 3). Wait, in the board state, it shows Snake #2 at position (3,3), but in the initial information, it says (4,3). I need to clarify that. Looking back, the board has rows and columns labeled from 0 to 9, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, if Snake #2 is at (3,3), that should be row 3, column 3.\n\nApples are located at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). Enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,2) with no body.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board correctly. Rows increase from bottom to top, so row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top. Columns increase from left to right, from 0 to 9.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . .

Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1). That's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different route.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat's three steps down, then right, then down.\n\nBut I need to consider if that path is clear and if Snake #1 might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) directly by moving right to (2,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1). But that still seems inefficient.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,2) and (2,3), then see the board again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should prioritize eating as many apples as possible in the shortest path.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (2,3), then left to (2,2). So, two steps to eat two apples.\n\nThen, perhaps aim for (6,1), which is down 4 and right 4.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I need to make sure my path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (8,0), which is down 6 and right 6 from (2,2).\n\nThat seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to group the apples.\n\nBut given the positions, they are spread out.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to eat (2,3) and (2,2), then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, my snake will have grown, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, by then, Snake #1 might have moved closer, so I need to keep an eye on its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat would be a path of 4 steps: down, down, right, down.\n\nI need to make sure that Snake #1 isn't in my way.\n\nLooking at Snake #1's possible moves, if it moves up from (0,2) to (0,3), then to (0,4), and so on, it might not interfere with my path.\n\nBut I need to consider that Snake #1 could also move right or down.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), then to (2,2), but by that time, I would have already eaten (2,2), so it might not be able to reach me.\n\nMoreover, after I eat (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nSo, Snake #1 would need to navigate around my body.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a position where Snake #1 can cut me off.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just proceed with the initial plan: down to (2,3), then left to (2,2), and assess from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (6,3), then left to (6,1).\n\nBut that's down 3, left 2, totaling 5 steps.\n\nCompared to going for (2,3) and (2,2), which is only 2 steps, I'd prefer the closer apples.\n\nMoreover, by going for the closer apples first, I can grow faster and secure those points sooner.\n\nSo, my decision is to go for (2,3) first, then (2,2), then reassess.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (2,3).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nDOWN"

A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, Snake #2 is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3. Apples are at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path to these apples, starting with the closest ones.\n\nFirst, calculate distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,3), just one step down.\n\nThen, from there, I can go to (2,2), which is adjacent.\n\nAfter that, I might consider moving towards (6,1), but that's a bit far. Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat's three steps down, then right, then down.\n\nBut I need to consider if that path is clear and if Snake #1 might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize eating as many apples as possible in the shortest path.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (2,3), then left to (2,2). So, two steps to eat two apples.\n\nThen, perhaps aim for (6,1), which is down 4 and right 4.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I need to make sure my path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (8,0), which is down 6 and right 6 from (2,2).\n\nThat seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to group the apples.\n\nBut given the positions, they are spread out.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to eat (2,3) and (2,2), then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, my snake will have grown, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, by then, Snake #1 might have moved closer, so I need to keep an eye on its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat would be a path of 4 steps: down, down, right, down.\n\nI need to make sure that Snake #1 isn't in my way.\n\nLooking at Snake #1's possible moves, if it moves up from (0,2) to (0,3), then to (0,4), and so on, it might not interfere with my path.\n\nBut I need to consider that Snake #1 could also move right or down.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), then to (2,2), but by that time, I would have already eaten (2,2), so it might not be able to reach me.\n\nMoreover, after I eat (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nSo, Snake #1 would need to navigate around my body.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a position where Snake #1 can cut me off.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just proceed with the initial plan: down to (2,3), then left to (2,2), and assess from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider going for (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (6,3), then left to (6,1).\n\nBut that's down 3, left 2, totaling 5 steps.\n\nCompared to going for the closer apples first, I'd prefer the closer apples.\n\nMoreover, by going for the closer apples first, I can grow faster and secure those points sooner.\n\nSo, my decision is to go for (2,3) first, then (2,2), then reassess.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (2,3).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nDOWN"

Currently, I only have my head, so no need to worry about my body yet.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. Up: (3,4) - looking at row 3, column 4. From the board, it's a dot, so it's safe.\n\n2. Down: (3,2) - row 3, column 2. There's an apple at (2,3), but wait, apple is at (2,2). Wait, no, apple at (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. So, (3,2) is a dot, safe.\n\n3. Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3. Looking at row 2, it's a dot, safe.\n\n4. Right: (4,3) - row 4, column 3. Looking at row 4, it's a dot, safe.\n\nWait, but in row 3, column 3, it's '2', which is me. Row 3, column 2 has an 'A' - wait, no, the apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with rows and columns. Let's clarify:\n\n- My head is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3.\n\n- Apples are at:\n\n- (2,2): row 2, column 2\n\n- (2,3): row 2, column 3\n\n- (6,1): row 6, column 1\n\n- (6,9): row 6, column 9\n\n- (8,0): row 8, column 0\n\nSo, from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4), which is row 3, column 4\n\n- Down: (3,2), which is row 3, column 2\n\n- Left: (2,3), which is row 2, column 3 (apple is at (2,3))\n\n- Right: (4,3), which is row 4, column 3\n\nNow, row 2, column 3 has an apple, so moving left would eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 2 has another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim to eat the apple at (2,3) first, then proceed to (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat the apple there, and my body grows. So, my tail will stay where it was, but since I just started, I only have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, since I'm just starting, moving to (2,3) and eating the apple will make my body stay at (3,3), but in reality, my body will extend, so I need to make sure I don't immediately turn back.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, I don't have a body yet beyond my head.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3), eating the apple, now my tail is at (3,3), and my head is at (2,3).\n\nNext, I can move left to (1,3), but there's no apple there. Or down to (2,2), which has an apple.\n\nSo, perhaps moving down from (2,3) to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from there, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (1,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 2, column 2 has an apple.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) would be picking up another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet's see the distances from (2,2) to other apples:\n\n- (6,1): down 4, right 5 \u2192 total 9 steps\n\n- (6,9): down 4, right 7 \u2192 total 11 steps\n\n- (8,0): down 6, right 2 \u2192 total 8 steps\n\nSo, (8,0) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), then left to (8,1), then (8,0).\n\nThat's 6 down and 2 left, total 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1):\n\nFrom (2,2), down to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's 4 down and 1 left, total 5 steps.\n\nThat seems shorter than going to (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,2), go to (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,1), I can aim for (6,9), but that's far.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,1), go to (8,0).\n\nWait, from (6,1), to (8,0), that's down 2, right 9, wrapping around, but the board doesn't wrap, so it's down 2, right 9, which is off the board.\n\nWait, no, the board is 10x10, so right 9 from column 1 is column 10, which is off the board.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it says coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9), and running into coordinates outside that range means hitting the wall.\n\nSo, from (6,1), moving right to (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,9), then (6,10), which is off the board.\n\nSo, to get to (8,0), from (6,1), I would need to move down to (7,1), (8,1), then left to (8,0).\n\nThat's 2 down and 1 left, total 3 steps.\n\nSo, from"

Down: (3,2) - row 3, column 2. There's an apple at (2,3), but that's in a different position. Wait, apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3. So, (3,2) is a dot, safe.\n\n3. Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3. There's an apple here.\n\n4. Right: (4,3) - row 4, column 3. It's a dot, safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3) would allow me to eat an apple, which is good because I gain a point and grow in length.\n\nBut I need to think ahead. After eating the apple at (2,3), my tail will stay where it was, but since I'm just starting, I only have one segment. So, after eating the apple, I have two segments: head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, I need to decide where to move from (2,3). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2) (another apple)\n\n- Left: (1,3)\n\n- Right: (3,3) (my tail)\n\nMoving right to (3,3) would be hitting my tail, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple is a good idea.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I would have three segments: head at (2,2), middle at (2,3), and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple. The closest seems to be (6,1), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is even farther, and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the movement of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0,4) with no body. I don't know its direction, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (6,1).\n\nSo, from (2,2):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\n- Left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that the path is clear and that I don't grow too large to maneuver.\n\nWait, actually, as I eat apples, my length increases, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet's think about the body trail:\n\n- After eating (2,3), body is at (3,3)\n\n- After eating (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3)\n\n- After moving to (3,2), body is at (2,2), (2,3), and (3,3)\n\n- And so on.\n\nI need to keep track of my body positions to avoid running into them.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves as well.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in this path, like the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, Snake #1 is at (0,4), and if it's moving down, it might intersect with my path.\n\nBut without knowing its direction, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first to minimize exposure.\n\nLooking back, the apple at (2,3) is adjacent to my current position, so it's the closest.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look towards (6,1).\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,0), but that seems farther.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1), then down to (7,1), (8,1), left to (8,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's quite a long path, and I might be exposed to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), right to (5,2), down to (6,2), right to (6,3), and so on.\n\nThis seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different strategy: prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3): these are adjacent.\n\n- (6,1), (6,9): these are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0): isolated.\n\nSo, perhaps eat (2,3), then (2,2), then move to (6,1), then (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (6,1) to (6,9) is risky because it's a long horizontal move, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,1), I could move up or down to position myself better for the next apple.\n\nWait, perhaps after eating (6,1), I can move up to (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), then left to (0,0), then down to (1,0), (2,0), ..., (8,0) to eat the apple at (8,0).\n\nBut that's a very long path and increases the risk of collision.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples in a different order.\n\nLet me think differently: calculate the Manhattan distances between all apples and plan a path that minimizes total movement.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nStarting from (3,3):\n\n- Closest apples are (2,3) and (2,2), both one step away.\n\n- Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\n- From (2,2), the next closest apple is"

I don't know its direction or behavior, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nI should prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize exposure and reduce the risk of collisions.\n\nThe apples at (2,2) and (2,3) are adjacent, so eating them in sequence makes sense.\n\nThen, I can consider moving towards (6,1), which is somewhat in the middle of the board.\n\nAfter that, I can aim for (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (2,2) to (6,1) would require passing through areas where the enemy snake could be.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating (2,3), then (2,2), then move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), and so on, gradually making my way towards (6,1).\n\nHowever, this seems time-consuming, and I might be better off choosing a different path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (6,1) directly from (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\nThat's five moves to reach (6,1). During this time, I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nBut since I'm growing with each apple I eat, I have to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nStarting at (3,3):\n\n1. Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nNow, my body is at (3,3) (tail) and head at (2,3).\n\n2. Move down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, my body is at (2,3) and (3,3), head at (2,2).\n\n3. Move right to (3,2)\n\nNow, body is at (2,3) and (2,2), head at (3,2).\n\n4. Move down to (4,2)\n\nNow, body is at (2,3) and (3,2), head at (4,2).\n\n5. Move right to (5,2)\n\nNow, body is at (3,2) and (4,2), head at (5,2).\n\n6. Move right to (6,2)\n\nNow, body is at (4,2) and (5,2), head at (6,2).\n\n7. Move left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, body is at (5,2) and (6,2), head at (6,1).\n\n8. Move up to (6,2)\n\nNow, body is at (6,2) and (6,1), head at (6,2). But this is my own body, so invalid.\n\nWait, I need to be careful not to move into my own body.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,1), my tail will be at (5,2), and head at (6,1).\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), that's where my tail is, which is now moved forward.\n\nWait, snake movement: when you move, the tail follows, so after moving to (6,1), the tail is at (6,2).\n\nWait, no. In snake games, typically, the tail moves to where the second-last segment was, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that after eating an apple, my tail stays where it was, but in reality, all segments move forward, and the tail stays where the previous tail was.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider using a simple pathfinding approach, like BFS, to find paths to apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut perhaps that's too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nGiven that, from (3,3), the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2), both one move away.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3) to eat the apple makes sense.\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, from (2,2), the next closest apple is (6,1), which is 4 units down and 4 units right.\n\nBut I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is farther up and to the right.\n\nBut (6,1) seems more immediate.\n\nSo, from (2,2), I can move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nDuring this time, I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nGiven that Snake #1 is at (0,6), and assuming it moves down, it could potentially reach (0,2) in 4 moves, but I would have moved right by then.\n\nIt's hard to predict its exact path without knowing its behavior.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could aim for (6,1), but I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, let's think about my body positions.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), my body is at (3,3).\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (3,2), body is at (2,3) and (2,2).\n\nThen, down to (4,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,2).\n\nThen, right to (5,2), body at (3,2) and (4,2).\n\nThen, right to (6,2), body at (4,2) and (5,2).\n\nThen, left to (6,1) to eat the apple, body at (5,2) and (6,2).\n\nThis seems okay, no collisions with myself.\n\nNext, from (6,1), I can move up to (6,2), but that's where my tail was, which has already moved forward.\n\nWait, in snake games, all segments move forward simultaneously.\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), the tail moves from (6,2) to where the previous tail was.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that after eating an apple,"

Let's see the current setup.\n\nFirst, my snake, ID 2, is at position (3,1). But looking at the board state, it seems like there might be a confusion in coordinates. In the board, row 0 is at the bottom, and row 9 is at the top, with columns from 0 to 9 left to right. So, my snake is at (3,1), which is in row 1, column 3.\n\nWait, but in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n...\n\nRow 1: . . . 2 . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . .

Let's see if that still makes sense.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving UP would take me to (3,2). Is there an apple there? Yes, there's an apple at (2,2), but (3,2) is empty according to the board.\n\nWait, apple at (2,2), which is left and up from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,3), which is up and left.\n\nBut from (3,1), moving UP to (3,2) doesn't directly take me to any apple, but it's a step towards (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the best path to take.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (2,2)\n\n- Move UP to (3,2)\n\n- Then LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (2,3)\n\n- Move UP to (3,2)\n\n- Then UP to (3,3)\n\n- Then LEFT to (2,3) to eat the apple\n\nBut looking at the board, (3,3) is empty, and (2,3) has an apple.\n\nWait, but (2,3) is also occupied by an apple, but I need to make sure that moving there doesn't cause me to hit anything.\n\nMoreover, there's another apple at (6,1), which is directly right from my current position.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at column 6, row 1, which is three steps to the right from my current position.\n\nSo, I have multiple apples to consider.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (2,2) or (2,3), which are up and left.\n\nOption 2: Go for (6,1), which is to the right.\n\nOption 3: Go for (6,9), which is up and right, but that's farther away.\n\nOption 4: Go for (8,0), which is right and down.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (6,1) first makes sense because it's in the horizontal direction, and there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving RIGHT to (4,1), then (5,1), then (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's three moves to the right.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in doing so, I don't run into the enemy snake.\n\nWhere is the enemy snake? It's at (0,7), which is column 0, row 7.\n\nFrom my position at (3,1), that's to the left and up.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might be moving towards me.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its direction or speed, I'll assume it's moving independently.\n\nMoreover, since it has no body segments, it's just its head.\n\nI should prioritize eating apples to grow longer and have an advantage in case of collisions.\n\nSo, perhaps going for the closest apple, which is (6,1), makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, going for (2,2) or (2,3) might be shorter in terms of steps, but (6,1) is directly horizontal, which might be safer.\n\nLet me consider the path to (6,1):\n\n- From (3,1) to (4,1)\n\n- To (5,1)\n\n- To (6,1)\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that no other snake is in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between (3,1) and (6,1), there are positions (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1).\n\nFrom the board state, these seem to be empty.\n\nAfter eating (6,1), I would grow, so my tail would stay where it was.\n\nThen, I can consider moving towards another apple.\n\nNext, perhaps going up to (6,2), then (6,3), and so on, towards (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, going towards (8,0), which is down and right.\n\nBut (6,9) is up and right, which might be a longer path.\n\nWait, (6,9) is at row 9, column 6.\n\nFrom (6,1), moving up to (6,2), then (6,3), ..., up to (6,9).\n\nThat's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake along the way.\n\nAlternatively, going towards (8,0), which is right and down from my current position.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can move right to (7,1), then (8,1), then down to (8,0).\n\nThat might be a shorter path.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (2,2) or (2,3) first, since they are closer.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving UP to (3,2), then LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), my tail will be at (3,2).\n\nThen, I can move UP to (2,3) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, my tail moves to (2,2), and head is at (2,3).\n\nThen, perhaps moving left to (1,3), then up or down.\n\nBut I need to plan further.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I can move left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then right to (2,2), but that seems inefficient.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for (6,1) first, as it's directly horizontal.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,1):\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (4,1)\n\n2. Move RIGHT to (5,1)\n\n3. Move RIGHT to (6,1) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating (6,1), I grow, so my tail is now at (5,1).\n\nThen, I can consider moving up to (6,2), then (6,3), and so on, towards (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,1), then (8,1), then down to (8,0) to eat another apple.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up to (6,2), then left or right accordingly.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should stick to the initial plan: go for the closest apple, which is (6,1), by moving right.\n\nSo, my next move should be RIGHT to (4,1).\n\nBut before confirming, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIs there any chance that the enemy snake could reach me while I'm moving right?\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,7), and assuming it moves down, it would take several moves to reach my area.\n\nGiven that, it might be safe to move right for now.\n\nMoreover, there are no other snakes or obstacles in my path to (6,1).\n\nTherefore, I think moving RIGHT to (4,1) is a safe choice.\n\nNext turn, I'll continue moving RIGHT to (5,1), then to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can reassess the situation and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"

There are apples at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). I need to navigate to these apples to grow and score points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nAnd snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 at (0,1) with no body.\n\n- Me, Snake #2 at (3,3).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions and plan a path to the apples. Since there are multiple apples, I should prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- To (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- To (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- To (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- To (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,3) is only one step down.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Down one step to (2,3), which is an apple.\n\n- From there, I can either go left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\n- Or, I can aim for other apples.\n\nBut I also need to be aware of the other snake, Snake #1 at (0,1). Since it has no body, it's just its head. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet's see where Snake #1 is and where it might be going.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,1). Possible moves for it:\n\n- Up to (0,2)\n\n- Right to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (0,0)\n\n- Left to (9,1) (since it's a wrap-around board?)\n\nWait, the rules don't specify if the board wraps around. It says \"run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates)\", so probably no wrap-around. So, if Snake #1 goes left from (0,1), it would hit the left wall and die.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can safely move up or right or down.\n\nSimilarly, I need to plan my path without hitting it.\n\nBut since Snake #1 is at (0,1) and I'm at (3,3), and the apples are at (2,2), (2,3), etc., it seems for now, Snake #1 is not immediately threatening me.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), I can move left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nBut I need to plan further ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) and (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be longer.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of Snake #1 and avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, if Snake #1 moves in a way that blocks my path, I need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, let's assume Snake #1 doesn't immediately interfere.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1), but that's quite a distance.\n\nAlternatively, look for closer apples.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), which is down 3 and right 3 from (3,3).\n\nBut there are apples at (6,1) and (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps try to group the apples together.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2) and (2,3) are close together.\n\n- (6,1) and (6,9) are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0) is alone.\n\nSo, maybe focus on the cluster at (2,2) and (2,3) first.\n\nAfter eating those, I can decide whether to go for (6,1) or (8,0).\n\n(6,9) is far away, and going there might expose me to risks.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize (2,2), (2,3), then (6,1), then (8,0).\n\nAs for Snake #1, I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the first few moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, maybe down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2) wouldn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps go down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), but that's not near any apple.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the board as a graph and find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think in terms of which apple is closest and go for that.\n\nGiven that, (2,3) is right below me, so that's the easiest to reach.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), so from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), I can move down to (5,2), but that's not directly towards (6,1).\n\nMaybe it's better to aim directly for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nSo, from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then right to (6,1).\n\nBut that's a long path and increases the risk of running into Snake #1 or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (7,2), then right to (7,0), then down to (8,0).\n\nBut that still seems too far.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the apple at (6,1) after (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider just going for (2,2) and (2,3), then see what's next.\n\nAfter all, in a multi-apple snake game, it's often better to grab the closest apples first to grow quickly and avoid being blocked by your own body.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1).\n\nBut wait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2) would require passing through areas where Snake #1 might be.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to move right to (2,5), but there's no apple there.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (6,1) as my next target after (2,2).\n\nTo get"

Apples are at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path to these apples, starting with the closest ones.\n\nFirst, calculate distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,3), just one step down.\n\nThen, from there, I can go to (2,2), which is adjacent.\n\nAfter that, I might consider moving towards (6,1), but that's a bit far. Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head. I need to make sure not to run into it or its possible moves.\n\nLet's think about Snake #1's possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,2), it can move up to (0,3), right to (1,2), down to (0,1), or left to (9,2).\n\nBut since the board doesn't wrap around (as per the rule about running into walls outside the listed coordinates), moving left to (9,2) would be hitting the left wall, which would kill Snake #1.\n\nSo, it's likely that Snake #1 will move up or right or down.\n\nIf it moves up to (0,3), that's not immediately threatening to me.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), that's also not in my immediate path.\n\nIf it moves down to (0,1), that's also not in my way.\n\nSo, for now, I can proceed with my plan to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving left to (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, (6,1) is at row 6, column 1, which is down 4 rows and right 8 columns from my current position, but considering I'll be at (2,2) after eating the second apple, it would be down 4 rows and right 4 columns to (6,6), but that's not the location of the apple at (6,1). So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1). That's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different route.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat's three steps down, then right, then down.\n\nBut I need to consider if that path is clear and if Snake #1 might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) directly by moving right to (2,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1). But that still seems inefficient.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating (2,2) and (2,3), then see the board again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should prioritize eating as many apples as possible in the shortest path.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (2,3), then left to (2,2). So, two steps to eat two apples.\n\nThen, perhaps aim for (6,1), which is down 4 and right 4.\n\nBut that's a long way, and I need to make sure my path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the apple at (6,9), but that's even farther.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the apple at (8,0), which is down 6 and right 6 from (2,2).\n\nThat seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to group the apples.\n\nBut given the positions, they are spread out.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to eat (2,3) and (2,2), then assess the situation.\n\nAfter eating those two apples, my snake will have grown, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nAlso, by then, Snake #1 might have moved closer, so I need to keep an eye on its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,1), then down to (6,1).\n\nThat would be a path of 4 steps: down, down, right, down.\n\nI need to make sure that Snake #1 isn't in my way.\n\nLooking at Snake #1's possible moves, if it moves up from (0,2) to (0,3), then to (0,4), and so on, it might not interfere with my path.\n\nBut I need to consider that Snake #1 could also move right or down.\n\nIf it moves right to (1,2), then to (2,2), but by that time, I would have already eaten (2,2), so it might not be able to reach me.\n\nMoreover, after I eat (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nSo, Snake #1 would need to navigate around my body.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a position where Snake #1 can cut me off.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should just proceed with the initial plan: down to (2,3), then left to (2,2), and assess from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (6,3), then left to (6,1).\n\nBut that's down 3, left 2, totaling 5 steps.\n\nCompared to going for (2,3) and (2,2), which is only 2 steps, I'd prefer the closer apples.\n\nMoreover, by going for the closer apples first, I can grow faster and secure those points sooner.\n\nSo, my decision is to go for (2,3) first, then (2,2), then reassess.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be down to (2,3).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nDOWN"

Row 3, column 2 has an 'A' - wait, no, the apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with rows and columns. Let's clarify:\n\n- My head is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3.\n\n- Apples are at:\n\n- (2,2): row 2, column 2\n\n- (2,3): row 2, column 3\n\n- (6,1): row 6, column 1\n\n- (6,9): row 6, column 9\n\n- (8,0): row 8, column 0\n\nSo, from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4), which is row 3, column 4\n\n- Down: (3,2), which is row 3, column 2\n\n- Left: (2,3), which is row 2, column 3 (apple is at (2,3))\n\n- Right: (4,3), which is row 4, column 3\n\nNow, row 2, column 3 has an apple, so moving left would eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 2 has another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim to eat the apple at (2,3) first, then proceed to (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat the apple there, and my body grows. So, my tail will stay where it was, but since I just started, I only have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, since I'm just starting, moving to (2,3) and eating the apple will make my body stay at (3,3), but in reality, my body will extend, so I need to make sure I don't immediately turn back.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, I don't have a body yet beyond my head.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3), eating the apple, now my tail is at (3,3), and my head is at (2,3).\n\nNext, I can move left to (1,3), but there's no apple there. Or down to (2,2), which has an apple.\n\nSo, perhaps moving down from (2,3) to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from there, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (1,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 2, column 2 has an apple.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) would be picking up another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet's see the distances from (2,2) to other apples:\n\n- (6,1): down 4, right 5 \u2192 total 9 steps\n\n- (6,9): down 4, right 7 \u2192 total 11 steps\n\n- (8,0): down 6, right 2 \u2192 total 8 steps\n\nSo, (8,0) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), then left to (8,1), then (8,0).\n\nThat's 6 down and 2 left, total 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1):\n\nFrom (2,2), down to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's 4 down and 1 left, total 5 steps.\n\nThat seems shorter than going to (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,2), go to (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,1), I can aim for (6,9), but that's far.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,1), go to (8,0).\n\nWait, from (6,1), to (8,0), that's down 2, right 9, wrapping around, but the board doesn't wrap, so it's down 2, right 9, which is off the board.\n\nWait, no, the board is 10x10, so right 9 from column 1 is column 10, which is off the board.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it says coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9), and running into coordinates outside that range means hitting the wall.\n\nSo, from (6,1), moving right to (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,9), then (6,10), which is off the board.\n\nSo, to get to (8,0), from (6,1), I would need to move down to (7,1), (8,1), then left to (8,0).\n\nThat's 2 down and 1 left, total 3 steps.\n\nSo, from"

Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2) (another apple)\n\n- Left: (1,3)\n\n- Right: (3,3) (my tail)\n\nMoving right to (3,3) would be hitting my tail, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple is a good idea.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I would have three segments: head at (2,2), middle at (2,3), and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple. The closest seems to be (6,1), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is even farther, and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the movement of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0,4) with no body. I don't know its direction, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (6,1).\n\nSo, from (2,2):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\n- Left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that the path is clear and that I don't grow too large to maneuver.\n\nWait, actually, as I eat apples, my length increases, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet's think about the body trail:\n\n- After eating (2,3), body is at (3,3)\n\n- After eating (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3)\n\n- After moving to (3,2), body is at (2,2), (2,3), and (3,3)\n\n- And so on.\n\nI need to keep track of my body positions to avoid running into them.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves as well.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in this path, like the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, Snake #1 is at (0,4), and if it's moving down, it might intersect with my path.\n\nBut without knowing its direction, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first to minimize exposure.\n\nLooking back, the apple at (2,3) is adjacent to my current position, so it's the closest.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look towards (6,1).\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,0), but that seems farther.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1), then down to (7,1), (8,1), left to (8,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's quite a long path, and I might be exposed to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), right to (5,2), down to (6,2), right to (6,3), and so on.\n\nThis seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different strategy: prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3): these are adjacent.\n\n- (6,1), (6,9): these are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0): isolated.\n\nSo, perhaps eat (2,3), then (2,2), then move to (6,1), then (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (6,1) to (6,9) is risky because it's a long horizontal move, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,1), I could move up or down to position myself better for the next apple.\n\nWait, perhaps after eating (6,1), I can move up to (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), then left to (0,0), then down to (1,0), (2,0), ..., (8,0) to eat the apple at (8,0).\n\nBut that's a very long path and increases the risk of collision.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples in a different order.\n\nLet me think differently: calculate the Manhattan distances between all apples and plan a path that minimizes total movement.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nStarting from (3,3):\n\n- Closest apples are (2,3) and (2,2), both one step away.\n\n- Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\n- From (2,2), the next closest apple is"

Let's see the current setup.\n\nMy snake, ID 2, is at position (3,0). Wait, but in the board state, it shows my snake at (3,3). There's a bit of confusion here. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the initial information:\n\n- Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3,0)\n\nBut in the board state:\n\n- Row 3: . . A 2 . . . . . . (me at (3,3), apple at (2,3))\n\nSo, there's inconsistency here. Let's assume the board state is correct, and I'm at (3,3). That makes more sense given the board layout.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nEnemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,6) with no body.\n\nBoard size is 10x10, coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\n\nNormal X,Y coordinates: increasing X to the right, increasing Y upwards.\n\nWait, but in the board display, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom, which is standard for grid displays.\n\nSo, my head is at (3,3). I need to decide my next move.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3) (there's an apple there)\n\n- Right: (4,3)\n\nFirst, I should consider eating the apple to grow and gain a point. Moving left to (2,3) would achieve that.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (2,3), my tail will stay where it was, but since I'm just starting, I only have one segment. So, after eating the apple, I have two segments: head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,3), I can look at the possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2) (another apple)\n\n- Left: (1,3)\n\n- Right: (3,3) (my tail)\n\nMoving right to (3,3) would be hitting my tail, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple seems like a good idea.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I would have three segments: head at (2,2), middle at (2,3), and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,2), I can consider moving down to (3,2), then perhaps towards (6,1).\n\nBut I need to plan carefully to avoid running into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, Snake #1 is at (0,6). I don't know its direction or behavior, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nI should prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize exposure and reduce the risk of collisions.\n\nThe apples at (2,2) and (2,3) are adjacent, so eating them in sequence makes sense.\n\nThen, I can consider moving towards (6,1), which is somewhat in the middle of the board.\n\nAfter that, I can aim for (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (2,2) to (6,1) would require passing through areas where the enemy snake could be.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating (2,3), then (2,2), then move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), and so on, gradually making my way towards (6,1).\n\nHowever, this seems time-consuming, and I might be better off choosing a different path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (6,1) directly from (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\nThat's five moves to reach (6,1). During this time, I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nBut since I'm growing with each apple I eat, I have to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nStarting at (3,3):\n\n1. Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nNow, my body is at (3,3) (tail) and head at (2,3).\n\n2. Move down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, my body is at (2,3) and (3,3), head at (2,2).\n\n3. Move right to (3,2)\n\nNow, body is at (2,3) and (2,2), head at (3,2).\n\n4. Move down to (4,2)\n\nNow, body is at (2,3) and (3,2), head at (4,2).\n\n5. Move right to (5,2)\n\nNow, body is at (3,2) and (4,2), head at (5,2).\n\n6. Move right to (6,2)\n\nNow, body is at (4,2) and (5,2), head at (6,2).\n\n7. Move left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, body is at (5,2) and (6,2), head at (6,1).\n\n8. Move up to (6,2)\n\nNow, body is at (6,2) and (6,1), head at (6,2). But this is my own body, so invalid.\n\nWait, I need to be careful not to move into my own body.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,1), my tail will be at (5,2), and head at (6,1).\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), that's where my tail is, which is now moved forward.\n\nWait, snake movement: when you move, the tail follows, so after moving to (6,1), the tail is at (6,2).\n\nWait, no. In snake games, typically, the tail moves to where the second-last segment was, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that after eating an apple, my tail stays where it was, but in reality, all segments move forward, and the tail stays where the previous tail was.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider using a simple pathfinding approach, like BFS, to find paths to apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut perhaps that's too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nGiven that, from (3,3), the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2), both one move away.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3) to eat the apple makes sense.\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, from (2,2), the next closest apple is (6,1), which is 4 units down and 4 units right.\n\nBut I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is farther up and to the right.\n\nBut (6,1) seems more immediate.\n\nSo, from (2,2), I can move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nDuring this time, I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nGiven that Snake #1 is at (0,6), and assuming it moves down, it could potentially reach (0,2) in 4 moves, but I would have moved right by then.\n\nIt's hard to predict its exact path without knowing its behavior.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could aim for (6,1), but I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, let's think about my body positions.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), my body is at (3,3).\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (3,2), body is at (2,3) and (2,2).\n\nThen, down to (4,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,2).\n\nThen, right to (5,2), body at (3,2) and (4,2).\n\nThen, right to (6,2), body at (4,2) and (5,2).\n\nThen, left to (6,1) to eat the apple, body at (5,2) and (6,2).\n\nThis seems okay, no collisions with myself.\n\nNext, from (6,1), I can move up to (6,2), but that's where my tail was, which has already moved forward.\n\nWait, in snake games, all segments move forward simultaneously.\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), the tail moves from (6,2) to where the previous tail was.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that after eating an apple,"

Let's see if that still makes sense.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving UP would take me to (3,2). Is there an apple there? Yes, there's an apple at (2,2), but (3,2) is empty according to the board.\n\nWait, apple at (2,2), which is left and up from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,3), which is up and left.\n\nBut from (3,1), moving UP to (3,2) doesn't directly take me to any apple, but it's a step towards (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the best path to take.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (2,2)\n\n- Move UP to (3,2)\n\n- Then LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (2,3)\n\n- Move UP to (3,2)\n\n- Then UP to (3,3)\n\n- Then LEFT to (2,3) to eat the apple\n\nBut looking at the board, (3,3) is empty, and (2,3) has an apple.\n\nWait, but (2,3) is also occupied by an apple, but I need to make sure that moving there doesn't cause me to hit anything.\n\nMoreover, there's another apple at (6,1), which is directly right from my current position.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at column 6, row 1, which is three steps to the right from my current position.\n\nSo, I have multiple apples to consider.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (2,2) or (2,3), which are up and left.\n\nOption 2: Go for (6,1), which is to the right.\n\nOption 3: Go for (6,9), which is up and right, but that's farther away.\n\nOption 4: Go for (8,0), which is right and down.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (6,1) first makes sense because it's in the horizontal direction, and there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving RIGHT to (4,1), then (5,1), then (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's three moves to the right.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in doing so, I don't run into the enemy snake.\n\nWhere is the enemy snake? It's at (0,7), which is column 0, row 7.\n\nFrom my position at (3,1), that's to the left and up.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might be moving towards me.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its direction or speed, I'll assume it's moving independently.\n\nMoreover, since it has no body segments, it's just its head.\n\nI should prioritize eating apples to grow longer and have an advantage in case of collisions.\n\nSo, perhaps going for the closest apple, which is (6,1), makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, going for (2,2) or (2,3) might be shorter in terms of steps, but (6,1) is directly horizontal, which might be safer.\n\nLet me consider the path to (6,1):\n\n- From (3,1) to (4,1)\n\n- To (5,1)\n\n- To (6,1)\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that no other snake is in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between (3,1) and (6,1), there are positions (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1).\n\nFrom the board state, these seem to be empty.\n\nAfter eating (6,1), I would grow, so my tail would stay where it was.\n\nThen, I can consider moving towards another apple.\n\nNext, perhaps going up to (6,2), then (6,3), and so on, towards (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, going towards (8,0), which is down and right.\n\nBut (6,9) is up and right, which might be a longer path.\n\nWait, (6,9) is at row 9, column 6.\n\nFrom (6,1), moving up to (6,2), then (6,3), ..., up to (6,9).\n\nThat's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake along the way.\n\nAlternatively, going towards (8,0), which is right and down from my current position.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can move right to (7,1), then (8,1), then down to (8,0).\n\nThat might be a shorter path.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (2,2) or (2,3) first, since they are closer.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving UP to (3,2), then LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), my tail will be at (3,2).\n\nThen, I can move UP to (2,3) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, my tail moves to (2,2), and head is at (2,3).\n\nThen, perhaps moving left to (1,3), then up or down.\n\nBut I need to plan further.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I can move left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then right to (2,2), but that seems inefficient.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for (6,1) first, as it's directly horizontal.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,1):\n\n1.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,3). There are apples at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). I need to navigate to these apples to grow and score points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing X, right is increasing X, down is decreasing Y, and up is increasing Y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: 1 . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nAnd snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 at (0,1) with no body.\n\n- Me, Snake #2 at (3,3).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions and plan a path to the apples. Since there are multiple apples, I should prioritize which one to go for first.\n\nLet's consider the distances from my current position (3,3) to each apple:\n\n- To (2,2): down 1, left 1 \u2192 total steps: 2\n\n- To (2,3): down 1 \u2192 total steps: 1\n\n- To (6,1): down 2, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 5\n\n- To (6,9): down 3, right 6 \u2192 total steps: 9\n\n- To (8,0): down 3, right 3 \u2192 total steps: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2). (2,3) is only one step down.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Down one step to (2,3), which is an apple.\n\n- From there, I can either go left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\n- Or, I can aim for other apples.\n\nBut I also need to be aware of the other snake, Snake #1 at (0,1). Since it has no body, it's just its head. I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nLet's see where Snake #1 is and where it might be going.\n\nSnake #1 is at (0,1). Possible moves for it:\n\n- Up to (0,2)\n\n- Right to (1,1)\n\n- Down to (0,0)\n\n- Left to (9,1) (since it's a wrap-around board?)\n\nWait, the rules don't specify if the board wraps around. It says \"run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates)\", so probably no wrap-around. So, if Snake #1 goes left from (0,1), it would hit the left wall and die.\n\nSo, Snake #1 can safely move up or right or down.\n\nSimilarly, I need to plan my path without hitting it.\n\nBut since Snake #1 is at (0,1) and I'm at (3,3), and the apples are at (2,2), (2,3), etc., it seems for now, Snake #1 is not immediately threatening me.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to go for the closest apple at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (2,3).\n\nThen, from (2,3), I can move left to (2,2), which is another apple.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nBut I need to plan further ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) and (2,2), I would have grown, so my body would be longer.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of Snake #1 and avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, if Snake #1 moves in a way that blocks my path, I need to adjust.\n\nBut for now, let's assume Snake #1 doesn't immediately interfere.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1), but that's quite a distance.\n\nAlternatively, look for closer apples.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), which is down 3 and right 3 from (3,3).\n\nBut there are apples at (6,1) and (6,9), and (8,0).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps try to group the apples together.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2) and (2,3) are close together.\n\n- (6,1) and (6,9) are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0) is alone.\n\nSo, maybe focus on the cluster at (2,2) and (2,3) first.\n\nAfter eating those, I can decide whether to go for (6,1) or (8,0).\n\n(6,9) is far away, and going there might expose me to risks.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize (2,2), (2,3), then (6,1), then (8,0).\n\nAs for Snake #1, I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the first few moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, maybe down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2) wouldn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps go down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), but that's not near any apple.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the board as a graph and find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think in terms of which apple is closest and go for that.\n\nGiven that, (2,3) is right below me, so that's the easiest to reach.\n\nSo, first move: down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps down to (5,2), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (2,1), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at (6,1), so from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), I can move down to (5,2), but that's not directly towards (6,1).\n\nMaybe it's better to aim directly for (6,1) after eating (2,2).\n\nSo, from (2,2), I need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then right to (6,1).\n\nBut that's a long path and increases the risk of running into Snake #1 or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0) after eating (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (7,2), then right to (7,0), then down to (8,0).\n\nBut that still seems too far.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the apple at (6,1) after (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider just going for (2,2) and (2,3), then see what's next.\n\nAfter all, in a multi-apple snake game, it's often better to grab the closest apples first to grow quickly and avoid being blocked by your own body.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3).\n\nThen, left to (2,2).\n\nAfter that, perhaps aim for (6,1).\n\nBut wait, from (2,2), moving down to (5,2) would require passing through areas where Snake #1 might be.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to move right to (2,5), but there's no apple there.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (6,1) as my next target after (2,2).\n\nTo get"

I need to clarify that. Looking back, the board has rows and columns labeled from 0 to 9, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, if Snake #2 is at (3,3), that should be row 3, column 3.\n\nApples are located at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). Enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,2) with no body.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board correctly. Rows increase from bottom to top, so row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top.

Alternatively, I could go for (8,0), which is also quite a distance.\n\nI need to be cautious of Snake #1, which is at (0,2). It has no body, so it's just its head.

So, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (8,0), which is down 6 rows and right 6 columns from (2,2).\n\nThis seems quite a distance, and I might grow in size, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for the apple at (6,1) next.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (5,2), then right to (5,5), then down to (6,5), then left to (6,1).

So, my head is at (3,3). But earlier it was mentioned I'm at (4,1). Maybe there's a mistake in the coordinates. I need to go by the board state.\n\nSo, my snake head is at (3,3). Apples are at (2,2), (2,3), (6,1), (6,9), and (8,0). Enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,4) with no body.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the coordinate system. Rows increase from bottom to top, so row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top. Columns increase from left to right, from 0 to 9.\n\nLet me sketch this out for clarity:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . A . . .

(apple at (8,0))\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my head is at (3,3). I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3)\n\n- Right: (4,3)\n\nI need to avoid walls, other snakes, and myself. Currently, I only have my head, so no need to worry about my body yet.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. Up: (3,4) - looking at row 3, column 4. From the board, it's a dot, so it's safe.\n\n2. Down: (3,2) - row 3, column 2. There's an apple at (2,3), but wait, apple is at (2,2). Wait, no, apple at (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. So, (3,2) is a dot, safe.\n\n3. Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3. Looking at row 2, it's a dot, safe.\n\n4. Right: (4,3) - row 4, column 3. Looking at row 4, it's a dot, safe.\n\nWait, but in row 3, column 3, it's '2', which is me. Row 3, column 2 has an 'A' - wait, no, the apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with rows and columns. Let's clarify:\n\n- My head is at (3,3), which is row 3, column 3.\n\n- Apples are at:\n\n- (2,2): row 2, column 2\n\n- (2,3): row 2, column 3\n\n- (6,1): row 6, column 1\n\n- (6,9): row 6, column 9\n\n- (8,0): row 8, column 0\n\nSo, from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4), which is row 3, column 4\n\n- Down: (3,2), which is row 3, column 2\n\n- Left: (2,3), which is row 2, column 3 (apple is at (2,3))\n\n- Right: (4,3), which is row 4, column 3\n\nNow, row 2, column 3 has an apple, so moving left would eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, column 2 has another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim to eat the apple at (2,3) first, then proceed to (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat the apple there, and my body grows. So, my tail will stay where it was, but since I just started, I only have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, since I'm just starting, moving to (2,3) and eating the apple will make my body stay at (3,3), but in reality, my body will extend, so I need to make sure I don't immediately turn back.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, I don't have a body yet beyond my head.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3), eating the apple, now my tail is at (3,3), and my head is at (2,3).\n\nNext, I can move left to (1,3), but there's no apple there. Or down to (2,2), which has an apple.\n\nSo, perhaps moving down from (2,3) to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from there, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I could move up to (1,3), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, row 2, column 2 has an apple.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) would be picking up another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet's see the distances from (2,2) to other apples:\n\n- (6,1): down 4, right 5 \u2192 total 9 steps\n\n- (6,9): down 4, right 7 \u2192 total 11 steps\n\n- (8,0): down 6, right 2 \u2192 total 8 steps\n\nSo, (8,0) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), then left to (8,1), then (8,0).\n\nThat's 6 down and 2 left, total 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps aim for (6,1):\n\nFrom (2,2), down to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's 4 down and 1 left, total 5 steps.\n\nThat seems shorter than going to (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps after eating (2,2), go to (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,1), I can aim for (6,9), but that's far.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,1), go to (8,0).\n\nWait, from (6,1), to (8,0), that's down 2, right 9, wrapping around, but the board doesn't wrap, so it's down 2, right 9, which is off the board.\n\nWait, no, the board is 10x10, so right 9 from column 1 is column 10, which is off the board.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it says coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9), and running into coordinates outside that range means hitting the wall.\n\nSo, from (6,1), moving right to (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,9), then (6,10), which is off the board.\n\nSo, to get to (8,0), from (6,1), I would need to move down to (7,1), (8,1), then left to (8,0).\n\nThat's 2 down and 1 left, total 3 steps.\n\nSo, from"

Enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,4) with no body.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the coordinate system. Rows increase from bottom to top, so row 0 is at the bottom, row 9 at the top.

Currently, I only have my head, so no need to worry about my body yet.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. Up: (3,4) - looking at row 3, column 4. It's a dot, so it's safe.\n\n2. Down: (3,2) - row 3, column 2. There's an apple at (2,3), but that's in a different position. Wait, apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3. So, (3,2) is a dot, safe.\n\n3. Left: (2,3) - row 2, column 3. There's an apple here.\n\n4. Right: (4,3) - row 4, column 3. It's a dot, safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3) would allow me to eat an apple, which is good because I gain a point and grow in length.\n\nBut I need to think ahead. After eating the apple at (2,3), my tail will stay where it was, but since I'm just starting, I only have one segment. So, after eating the apple, I have two segments: head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, I need to decide where to move from (2,3). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2) (another apple)\n\n- Left: (1,3)\n\n- Right: (3,3) (my tail)\n\nMoving right to (3,3) would be hitting my tail, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple is a good idea.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I would have three segments: head at (2,2), middle at (2,3), and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,2), I can look for the next apple. The closest seems to be (6,1), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is even farther, and (8,0).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the movement of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0,4) with no body. I don't know its direction, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (6,1).\n\nSo, from (2,2):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\n- Left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that the path is clear and that I don't grow too large to maneuver.\n\nWait, actually, as I eat apples, my length increases, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet's think about the body trail:\n\n- After eating (2,3), body is at (3,3)\n\n- After eating (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3)\n\n- After moving to (3,2), body is at (2,2), (2,3), and (3,3)\n\n- And so on.\n\nI need to keep track of my body positions to avoid running into them.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (6,1) directly from (3,3).\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's five moves as well.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles in this path, like the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, Snake #1 is at (0,4), and if it's moving down, it might intersect with my path.\n\nBut without knowing its direction, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the closest apples first to minimize exposure.\n\nLooking back, the apple at (2,3) is adjacent to my current position, so it's the closest.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThen, from (2,2), I can look towards (6,1).\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,0), but that seems farther.\n\nWait, from (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1), then down to (7,1), (8,1), left to (8,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's quite a long path, and I might be exposed to the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), right to (5,2), down to (6,2), right to (6,3), and so on.\n\nThis seems too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different strategy: prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (2,2), (2,3): these are adjacent.\n\n- (6,1), (6,9): these are on the same row but far apart.\n\n- (8,0): isolated.\n\nSo, perhaps eat (2,3), then (2,2), then move to (6,1), then (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (6,1) to (6,9) is risky because it's a long horizontal move, and I might run into the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,1), I could move up or down to position myself better for the next apple.\n\nWait, perhaps after eating (6,1), I can move up to (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), then left to (0,0), then down to (1,0), (2,0), ..., (8,0) to eat the apple at (8,0).\n\nBut that's a very long path and increases the risk of collision.\n\nMaybe I should consider eating the apples in a different order.\n\nLet me think differently: calculate the Manhattan distances between all apples and plan a path that minimizes total movement.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nStarting from (3,3):\n\n- Closest apples are (2,3) and (2,2), both one step away.\n\n- Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\n- From (2,2), the next closest apple is"

Let me double-check.\n\nIn the initial information:\n\n- Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3,0)\n\nBut in the board state:\n\n- Row 3: . . A 2 . . . . . . (me at (3,3), apple at (2,3))\n\nSo, there's inconsistency here. Let's assume the board state is correct, and I'm at (3,3). That makes more sense given the board layout.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,9)\n\n- (8,0)\n\nEnemy snake, Snake #1, is at (0,6) with no body.\n\nBoard size is 10x10, coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\n\nNormal X,Y coordinates: increasing X to the right, increasing Y upwards.\n\nWait, but in the board display, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom, which is standard for grid displays.\n\nSo, my head is at (3,3). I need to decide my next move.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3) (there's an apple there)\n\n- Right: (4,3)\n\nFirst, I should consider eating the apple to grow and gain a point. Moving left to (2,3) would achieve that.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (2,3), my tail will stay where it was, but since I'm just starting, I only have one segment. So, after eating the apple, I have two segments: head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,3), I can look at the possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2) (another apple)\n\n- Left: (1,3)\n\n- Right: (3,3) (my tail)\n\nMoving right to (3,3) would be hitting my tail, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple seems like a good idea.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I would have three segments: head at (2,2), middle at (2,3), and tail at (3,3).\n\nNext, from (2,2), I can consider moving down to (3,2), then perhaps towards (6,1).\n\nBut I need to plan carefully to avoid running into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, Snake #1 is at (0,6). I don't know its direction or behavior, so I have to assume it could move towards me.\n\nI should prioritize eating apples that are closer to each other to minimize exposure and reduce the risk of collisions.\n\nThe apples at (2,2) and (2,3) are adjacent, so eating them in sequence makes sense.\n\nThen, I can consider moving towards (6,1), which is somewhat in the middle of the board.\n\nAfter that, I can aim for (6,9), and finally (8,0).\n\nBut moving from (2,2) to (6,1) would require passing through areas where the enemy snake could be.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating (2,3), then (2,2), then move right to (3,2), then down to (4,2), and so on, gradually making my way towards (6,1).\n\nHowever, this seems time-consuming, and I might be better off choosing a different path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (6,1) directly from (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (5,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1)\n\nThat's five moves to reach (6,1). During this time, I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nBut since I'm growing with each apple I eat, I have to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nStarting at (3,3):\n\n1. Move left to (2,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nNow, my body is at (3,3) (tail) and head at (2,3).\n\n2. Move down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, my body is at (2,3) and (3,3), head at (2,2).\n\n3. Move right to (3,2)\n\nNow, body is at (2,3) and (2,2), head at (3,2).\n\n4. Move down to (4,2)\n\nNow, body is at (2,3) and (3,2), head at (4,2).\n\n5. Move right to (5,2)\n\nNow, body is at (3,2) and (4,2), head at (5,2).\n\n6. Move right to (6,2)\n\nNow, body is at (4,2) and (5,2), head at (6,2).\n\n7. Move left to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, body is at (5,2) and (6,2), head at (6,1).\n\n8. Move up to (6,2)\n\nNow, body is at (6,2) and (6,1), head at (6,2). But this is my own body, so invalid.\n\nWait, I need to be careful not to move into my own body.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,1), my tail will be at (5,2), and head at (6,1).\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), that's where my tail is, which is now moved forward.\n\nWait, snake movement: when you move, the tail follows, so after moving to (6,1), the tail is at (6,2).\n\nWait, no. In snake games, typically, the tail moves to where the second-last segment was, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that after eating an apple, my tail stays where it was, but in reality, all segments move forward, and the tail stays where the previous tail was.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider using a simple pathfinding approach, like BFS, to find paths to apples while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut perhaps that's too time-consuming for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a greedy approach: always move towards the closest apple.\n\nGiven that, from (3,3), the closest apples are at (2,3) and (2,2), both one move away.\n\nSo, moving left to (2,3) to eat the apple makes sense.\n\nThen, from (2,3), moving down to (2,2) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, from (2,2), the next closest apple is (6,1), which is 4 units down and 4 units right.\n\nBut I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, there's (6,9), which is farther up and to the right.\n\nBut (6,1) seems more immediate.\n\nSo, from (2,2), I can move down to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then left to (6,1).\n\nThat's a straightforward path.\n\nDuring this time, I need to ensure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nGiven that Snake #1 is at (0,6), and assuming it moves down, it could potentially reach (0,2) in 4 moves, but I would have moved right by then.\n\nIt's hard to predict its exact path without knowing its behavior.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,3) and (2,2), I could aim for (6,1), but I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nWait, let's think about my body positions.\n\nAfter eating (2,3), my body is at (3,3).\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nThen, moving right to (3,2), body is at (2,3) and (2,2).\n\nThen, down to (4,2), body is at (2,3) and (3,2).\n\nThen, right to (5,2), body at (3,2) and (4,2).\n\nThen, right to (6,2), body at (4,2) and (5,2).\n\nThen, left to (6,1) to eat the apple, body at (5,2) and (6,2).\n\nThis seems okay, no collisions with myself.\n\nNext, from (6,1), I can move up to (6,2), but that's where my tail was, which has already moved forward.\n\nWait, in snake games, all segments move forward simultaneously.\n\nSo, when I move to (6,1), the tail moves from (6,2) to where the previous tail was.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that after eating an apple,"

Yes, there's an apple at (2,2), but (3,2) is empty according to the board.\n\nWait, apple at (2,2), which is left and up from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,3), which is up and left.\n\nBut from (3,1), moving UP to (3,2) doesn't directly take me to any apple, but it's a step towards (2,2).\n\nLet me think about the best path to take.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (2,2)\n\n- Move UP to (3,2)\n\n- Then LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (2,3)\n\n- Move UP to (3,2)\n\n- Then UP to (3,3)\n\n- Then LEFT to (2,3) to eat the apple\n\nBut looking at the board, (3,3) is empty, and (2,3) has an apple.\n\nWait, but (2,3) is also occupied by an apple, but I need to make sure that moving there doesn't cause me to hit anything.\n\nMoreover, there's another apple at (6,1), which is directly right from my current position.\n\nWait, (6,1) is at column 6, row 1, which is three steps to the right from my current position.\n\nSo, I have multiple apples to consider.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (2,2) or (2,3), which are up and left.\n\nOption 2: Go for (6,1), which is to the right.\n\nOption 3: Go for (6,9), which is up and right, but that's farther away.\n\nOption 4: Go for (8,0), which is right and down.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (6,1) first makes sense because it's in the horizontal direction, and there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving RIGHT to (4,1), then (5,1), then (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's three moves to the right.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in doing so, I don't run into the enemy snake.\n\nWhere is the enemy snake? It's at (0,7), which is column 0, row 7.\n\nFrom my position at (3,1), that's to the left and up.\n\nI need to consider if the enemy snake might be moving towards me.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its direction or speed, I'll assume it's moving independently.\n\nMoreover, since it has no body segments, it's just its head.\n\nI should prioritize eating apples to grow longer and have an advantage in case of collisions.\n\nSo, perhaps going for the closest apple, which is (6,1), makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, going for (2,2) or (2,3) might be shorter in terms of steps, but (6,1) is directly horizontal, which might be safer.\n\nLet me consider the path to (6,1):\n\n- From (3,1) to (4,1)\n\n- To (5,1)\n\n- To (6,1)\n\nDuring these moves, I need to ensure that no other snake is in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between (3,1) and (6,1), there are positions (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1).\n\nFrom the board state, these seem to be empty.\n\nAfter eating (6,1), I would grow, so my tail would stay where it was.\n\nThen, I can consider moving towards another apple.\n\nNext, perhaps going up to (6,2), then (6,3), and so on, towards (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, going towards (8,0), which is down and right.\n\nBut (6,9) is up and right, which might be a longer path.\n\nWait, (6,9) is at row 9, column 6.\n\nFrom (6,1), moving up to (6,2), then (6,3), ..., up to (6,9).\n\nThat's a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake along the way.\n\nAlternatively, going towards (8,0), which is right and down from my current position.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can move right to (7,1), then (8,1), then down to (8,0).\n\nThat might be a shorter path.\n\nBut again, I need to consider the enemy snake's movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (2,2) or (2,3) first, since they are closer.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving UP to (3,2), then LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), my tail will be at (3,2).\n\nThen, I can move UP to (2,3) to eat another apple.\n\nNow, my tail moves to (2,2), and head is at (2,3).\n\nThen, perhaps moving left to (1,3), then up or down.\n\nBut I need to plan further.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), I can move left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then right to (2,2), but that seems inefficient.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for (6,1) first, as it's directly horizontal.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,1):\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (4,1)\n\n2. Move RIGHT to (5,1)\n\n3. Move RIGHT to (6,1) to eat the apple\n\nAfter eating (6,1), I grow, so my tail is now at (5,1).\n\nThen, I can consider moving up to (6,2), then (6,3), and so on, towards (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,1), then (8,1), then down to (8,0) to eat another apple.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up to (6,2), then left or right accordingly.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should stick to the initial plan: go for the closest apple, which is (6,1), by moving right.\n\nSo, my next move should be RIGHT to (4,1).\n\nBut before confirming, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIs there any chance that the enemy snake could reach me while I'm moving right?\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,7), and assuming it moves down, it would take several moves to reach my area.\n\nGiven that, it might be safe to move right for now.\n\nMoreover, there are no other snakes or obstacles in my path to (6,1).\n\nTherefore, I think moving RIGHT to (4,1) is a safe choice.\n\nNext turn, I'll continue moving RIGHT to (5,1), then to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can reassess the situation and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move RIGHT.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"
