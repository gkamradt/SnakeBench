My goal is to get to a safe distance and then reassess the board to make a move towards one of the apples.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the closest apple to me is still at (4, 8) or (5, 8), which might be easier to reach than the ones at the top. Since I'm already at the same y-coordinate as the apples, I think I'll move to the right to get closer to the apples.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake's body at (2, 8). To avoid this, I'll move right carefully, checking the board state to make sure I'm not running into the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving right to get closer to the apples, and reassess the situation to make sure I'm not running into the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
