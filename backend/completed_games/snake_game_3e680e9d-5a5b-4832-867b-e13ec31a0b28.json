If I move UP to (9, 2), I will be safe but will be left with two more UP moves to reach (9, 7) where the apple is located.

I can reach it by moving UP twice. \n   - The next nearest apple on the board is at (6, 9); I would need to make a more complex route to reach this from my current position.\n   - Other apples are further away, either requiring multiple moves or are completely inaccessible without hitting walls.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake:**\n   - The enemy snake (Snake #2) is currently positioned at (8, 7). If I move UP to (9, 2), I will be safe but will be left with two more UP moves to reach (9, 7) where the apple is located. However, on the next turn, Snake #2 could potentially move into (8, 7) and I don\u2019t want to collide with it.\n   - I have to avoid colliding with that enemy snake.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is most strategic for me to move UP to (9, 2).

I can reach it by moving UP twice. \n   - The next nearest apple on the board is at (6, 9); I would need to make a more complex route to reach this from my current position.\n   - Other apples are further away, either requiring multiple moves or are completely inaccessible without hitting walls.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake:**\n   - The enemy snake (Snake #2) is currently positioned at (8, 7). If I move UP to (9, 2), I will be safe but will be left with two more UP moves to reach (9, 7) where the apple is located.

The most promising apple is at (6, 9), which is reachable in a few moves. \n\n### Future Moves towards Apples:\nTo reach the nearest apples (especially (6, 9)), I'll need to start moving down in the X coordinates:\n\n1. **Moving back to (9, 7)** achieves nothing.\n2. **Going up to (9, 8)** could be possible, but it's also not beneficial towards getting to the apples.\n3. **LEFT to (8, 7)** is simply backtracking.\n4. **Moving towards (8, 7)** seems pointless, because I achieve no movement towards fruit.\n\n### Conclusion for Next Move:\nThe best option appears to be moving **UP to (9, 8)** as this keeps options open to either next moves downward or lateral movement towards the apples. While it doesn't bring me closer to an immediate score, it allows me to maintain flexibility in the next turn and reassess.\n\n**Decided next move: UP**."

If I move UP to (9, 2), I will be safe but will be left with two more UP moves to reach (9, 7) where the apple is located.

The most promising apple is at (6, 9), which is reachable in a few moves. \n\n### Future Moves towards Apples:\nTo reach the nearest apples (especially (6, 9)), I'll need to start moving down in the X coordinates:\n\n1. **Moving back to (9, 7)** achieves nothing.\n2. **Going up to (9, 8)** could be possible, but it's also not beneficial towards getting to the apples.\n3. **LEFT to (8, 7)** is simply backtracking.\n4. **Moving towards (8, 7)** seems pointless, because I achieve no movement towards fruit.\n\n### Conclusion for Next Move:\nThe best option appears to be moving **UP to (9, 8)** as this keeps options open to either next moves downward or lateral movement towards the apples.

If I move UP to (9, 2), I will be safe but will be left with two more UP moves to reach (9, 7) where the apple is located.

There are no imminent threats from this snake, as I am two columns away and there is no direct path conflict.\n\n### Obstacles\n- There are no walls or barriers in the way of moving UP to (9, 7).\n\n### Future Considerations\n- Once I consume the apple and grow, I will be at (9, 7). The next apple to consider is at (9, 7), but I will need to evaluate further moves after that. The closest available apple then would likely be (6, 9) or potentially evaluate the snake movements.\n\n### Strategy\n- The immediate strategy is to secure the apple directly above me. After consuming the apple, I will assess the next moves based on remaining apples' locations.\n\nGiven all this analysis, I will move **UP** to (9, 7) to consume the apple."

I can try to move right and see if I can get closer to the apple without running into any obstacles.\n\nHowever, I just realized that the apple at (9, 7) is actually occupied by the snake at (8, 8) with a body at (8, 7). This means that I won't be able to eat the apple at (9, 7) even if I move right.\n\nMy next goal should be to find a safer path to the apple at (2, 6). I can try to move up and then right to get closer to the apple without running into any obstacles.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move up and then right to get closer to the apple at (2, 6) without running into any obstacles.\n\nNext move: UP.\n\nI'll move up to (9, 1) and then assess the situation from there. If I can safely move right, I'll do so. If not, I'll need to come up with a new plan.\n\nHowever, I'm at (9, 2) now, not (9, 1). I can still move up to (9, 1) but then I'll be at the same y-coordinate as the snake at (9, 1) which is not a problem. \n\nDecided next move: UP."
