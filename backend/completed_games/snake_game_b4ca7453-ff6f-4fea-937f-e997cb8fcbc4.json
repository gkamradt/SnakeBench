That's a pretty easy target, so I think I'll head towards it. I'll move up to position (0, 8) and then try to get to the apple.\n\nI also notice that Snake #2 is at position (6, 3), which is a bit far from me. I don't think I'll run into it anytime soon, so I won't worry about it for now.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to focus on getting to the apple at (0, 7) and then reassess my options from there.\n\nNext move: UP"

My goal is to collect as many apples as possible and avoid running into walls or other snakes.\n\nSince I'm currently at (6, 3), I have a few options. I could try to move towards the apple at (3, 6), but I'm not sure if I can reach it without running into the wall or another snake.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (6, 1), but I'm not sure if I can fit through the gap.\n\nI could also try to move towards the apple at (1, 2), but I'm not sure if I can reach it without running into the wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to try to move towards the apple at (3, 6) and see if I can reach it.
