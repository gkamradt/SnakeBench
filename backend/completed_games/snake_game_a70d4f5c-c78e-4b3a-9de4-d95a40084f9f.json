Collecting it provides an immediate point and brings the snake closer to another apple at (0, 5).\n  - **Maintain Safety:** Moving DOWN keeps the snake away from the enemy snake located at (4, 5), minimizing collision risks.\n  - **Future Flexibility:** After collecting the apple at (0, 7), the snake can continue moving DOWN towards (0, 5) or explore other directions as needed, maintaining multiple options for navigation.\n\n- **Considerations:**\n  - **Risk of Trapping:** Continuously moving in one direction (DOWN) could potentially lead to the snake being confined to a narrow path if not managed carefully. However, given the current board state and the positions of the apples, this risk is minimal.\n  - **Enemy Snake Position:** The enemy snake is positioned away from the immediate vicinity, so moving DOWN does not pose any immediate threats.\n\nGiven these factors, moving **DOWN** to (0, 7) is the optimal choice. This move secures an apple, advances the snake towards additional points, maintains a safe distance from the enemy, and preserves future movement options.\n\n**Decided next move:** DOWN"

Currently, I'm well-positioned to avoid any walls or other snakes, as no other immediate obstacles are present.\n\n### Decision\n\n**My next move is: DOWN**\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- After moving to (6, 4), reassess the apple locations and the movements of Snake #2.\n- Consider initiating a path towards either the apple at (1, 3) or (0, 1) based on the least resistance and quickest access, while staying flexible to adapt to any positional changes on the board."

Because Snake #2 might not bring immediate competition for these apples, remaining adaptable is both safe and strategic.\n\n### Decision\n\nWith the apple at (6, 4) being directly next on my path, a move **RIGHT** from (5, 5) to (6, 5) ensures continuous movement toward a target apple efficiently while keeping me adaptable for future moves.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn**: After reaching (6, 4), assess repositioning towards (1, 3) or another viable target that avoids potential conflicts.\n\n**My next move is: RIGHT**"

Collecting it provides an immediate point and brings the snake closer to another apple at (0, 5).\n  - **Maintain Safety:** Moving DOWN keeps the snake away from the enemy snake located at (4, 5), minimizing collision risks.\n  - **Future Flexibility:** After collecting the apple at (0, 7), the snake can continue moving DOWN towards (0, 5) or explore other directions as needed, maintaining multiple options for navigation.\n\n- **Considerations:**\n  - **Risk of Trapping:** Continuously moving in one direction (DOWN) could potentially lead to the snake being confined to a narrow path if not managed carefully. However, given the current board state and the positions of the apples, this risk is minimal.\n  - **Enemy Snake Position:** The enemy snake is positioned away from the immediate vicinity, so moving DOWN does not pose any immediate threats.\n\nGiven these factors, moving **DOWN** to (0, 7) is the optimal choice.

However, moving downward would reverse the last move (UP), which may risk self-collision if the snake's length is greater than one.\n    - **Pros:** Repositioning downward could be strategic if future threats are anticipated from above, but currently, there are no immediate advantages.\n    - **Cons:** Moving downward takes the snake away from all available apples, reducing immediate scoring opportunities and potentially risking self-collision.\n\n  - **LEFT** to (-1, 4):\n    - **Safety:** This move would take the snake outside the board boundaries, resulting in an immediate loss.\n    - **Pros:** N/A\n    - **Cons:** Invalid move; results in collision with the wall.\n\n- **Strategy Considerations:**\n  \n  - **Immediate Scoring:** Prioritizing moves that lead directly to nearby apples maximizes point gains efficiently. The upward direction offers quick access to two apples at (0, 6) and (0, 7).\n  \n  - **Safety and Flexibility:** Maintaining a position that allows for both immediate and future movements without risking collisions is crucial. Remaining along the left edge minimizes immediate threats from the enemy snake\u2019s current path.\n  \n  - **Opponent Avoidance:** Keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake ensures that there is no immediate risk of collision and reduces the chances of being cornered.\n\n- **Decision:**\n  \n  - **Primary Choice:** Moving **UP** to (0, 5) strategically positions the snake closer to multiple apples, enhancing immediate scoring potential while maintaining safety from the enemy snake.

An apple is present at this location, which is beneficial for growth and scoring. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake at (0, 8), as moving up towards (0, 6) does not interfere with the enemy's current path.\n    - **Pros:** \n      - Collecting the apple at (0, 6) will grant an additional point and increase the snake's length, enhancing future maneuverability.\n      - Staying along the left edge maintains a clear path, minimizing the risk of collision with the enemy snake.\n      - Proximity to another apple at (0, 7) allows for consecutive point gains in subsequent moves.\n    - **Cons:** \n      - Approaching the top edge limits upward movement options in the future, but sufficient space remains to maneuver towards other apples.\n\n  - **RIGHT** to (1, 5):\n    - **Safety:** The position (1, 5) is within the board boundaries and currently unoccupied. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake in this direction.\n    - **Pros:**\n      - Moving right opens up horizontal mobility, potentially accessing apples located further along the x-axis, such as at (8, 3) and (8, 7).\n      - Avoids direct vertical alignment with the enemy snake, reducing the chance of future conflicts.\n    - **Cons:**\n      - Does not provide immediate access to nearby apples, potentially delaying point accumulation from available opportunities.\n\n  - **DOWN** to (0, 4):\n    - **Safety:** Moving down would reverse the previous move (UP), which risks self-collision if the snake's length is greater than one.\n    - **Pros:** \n      - Limited strategic advantage as there are no immediate threats from below.\n    - **Cons:**\n      - Moves away from all available apples, reducing immediate scoring opportunities.\n      - Potential risk of self-collision if reversing direction is not permitted due to snake length.\n\n  - **LEFT** to (-1, 5):\n    - **Safety:** This move would take the snake outside the board boundaries, resulting in an immediate loss.\n    - **Pros:** N/A\n    - **Cons:** \n      - Invalid move; results in collision with the wall.\n\n- **Strategy Considerations:**\n  \n  - **Immediate Scoring:** Prioritizing moves that lead directly to nearby apples maximizes point gains efficiently. Moving up to (0, 6) allows for immediate collection of an apple.\n  \n  - **Safety and Flexibility:** Maintaining a position that allows for both immediate and future movements without risking collisions is crucial. Staying along the left edge minimizes immediate threats from the enemy snake\u2019s current path.\n  \n  - **Opponent Avoidance:** Keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake ensures there is no immediate risk of collision and reduces the chances of being cornered.\n\n- **Decision:**\n  \n  - **Primary Choice:** Moving **UP** to (0, 6) is strategically advantageous. It allows for the immediate collection of an apple, enhancing both growth and scoring potential. Additionally, it positions the snake favorably for subsequent moves towards another nearby apple at (0, 7) while maintaining safety from the enemy snake.\n  \n  - **Alternative Consideration:** Moving **RIGHT** offers increased horizontal mobility but does not capitalize on the immediate opportunity to collect an apple, making it a less optimal choice in the current context.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"

Its body is extending to the right and then down, according to the previous information.\n   \n4. **Board Navigation**:\n   - From our current position (0, 7), moving DOWN again will efficiently capture the next apple without immediate risk since Snake #2's head is positioned at (0, 5) (one step further down than our immediate next apple). Our move will allow us to eat the apple safely. \n   \n5. **Strategy Analysis**:\n   - By collecting both apples at (0, 7) and (0, 6), we ensure immediate point gains, placing us in a potentially advantageous position.\n   - After collecting the next apple at (0, 6), we'll need to carefully navigate to avoid potential conflict with Snake #2 and consider other apple locations.\n\n### Analysis & Strategy:\n\n- **Immediate Goal**: Collect the apple at (0, 6). This will give us another point and extend our snake length.\n\n- **Threat Awareness**: Be cautious about future moves as continuing further down will bring us very close to Snake #2.\n\n- **Next Step Post-Move**: After collecting the apple at (0, 6), evaluate the position of Snake #2 and potentially consider moving away (e.g., move RIGHT to avoid conflict).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo maximize our points while still avoiding collision risks, the immediate move should be DOWN to capture the apple at (0, 6).\n\nDecided Next Move: DOWN"
