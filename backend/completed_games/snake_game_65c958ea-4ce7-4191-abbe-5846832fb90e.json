This will put us in a better position for any apples that may appear in the center or right side of the board.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."

Looking at Snake #2's position, it's pretty clear he might be moving towards the apple at (4, 9) given its proximity.\n\nWhile keeping a constant eye on my own position and Snake #2, I should start making moves to reach (8, 4) as quickly as possible. Going by the shortest path, the best strategy would be to move UP. That also facilitates a better position to get the apple at (9, 7) later on.\n\nReoccupying (8, 0) after consuming the apple at (8, 4) could trap me within my own body, hence, care should be taken to avoid repeating any coordinates along the x/y coordinates (8,0) to (8,4). During this phase, it would be a good idea to keep the movements vertical, to prepare for my next target at (9, 7).\n\nAfter this though, I'll have to reassess the situation, considering the changes from Snake #2's movements. \n\nDecided next move: UP."
