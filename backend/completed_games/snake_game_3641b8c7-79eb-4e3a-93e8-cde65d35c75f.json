Both are significant distances.\n3. **Avoid Walls**: Ensure we do not move out of the board limits (0-9 for both x and y).\n\nGiven the current scenario:\n- Moving up will take us closer to the apple at (9,9).\n- Moving right will take us closer to apples at both positions (9,8) and (9, 7).\n\n**Strategy**: Move up the board towards the apple at (9,9) to get faster growth.\n\nYour next move should be:\n```\nUP\n```"
