No immediate threats, but doesn't get me closer to any apples.\n\nSnake 1 is directly above me, but two spaces away. The apple at (4,7) and (4,9) are good targets.\n\nMoving UP seems like a reasonable move, getting further from snake 1. Moving LEFT also has merit, getting closer to the (4,7) apple. Between UP and LEFT, I prefer UP, as it puts more distance between me and the other snake.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving UP, I will reassess. If snake 1 moves down, I will likely move LEFT towards the (4,7) apple. If snake 1 does not move down, I will consider moving UP again towards (4,9) or LEFT towards (4,7) depending on the overall board state.\n\nFinal Answer: UP"
