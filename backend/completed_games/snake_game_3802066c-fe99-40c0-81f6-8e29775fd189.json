            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,7). There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . 1 . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, snake 1 is at (6,0), but its body is empty, which probably means it's just the head with no tail yet.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,7) to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2): |4-3| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. (0,5): |4-0| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5): |4-8| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4): |4-1| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n5. (4,3): |4-4| + |7-3| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nSo, the apple at (4,3) is closest with a distance of 4.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and potential blockages.\n\nLooking at the board, snake 1 is at (6,0), and it's possible it will move upwards since there are apples above it.\n\nI need to plan a path to (4,3) without crossing paths with snake 1.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFrom (4,7), to get to (4,3), I need to move down 4 steps.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,7) and (4,3), rows 6,5,4 are empty in column 4.\n\nWait, row 5 has an apple at (4,5), but that's not in my path.\n\nActually, my path would be:\n\n(4,7) -> (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3)\n\nChecking the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nSo, column 4:\n\nRow 7: 2\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nLooks clear.\n\nBut I need to consider that when I move down, I might be approaching areas where other snakes could be.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (4,3), I need to plan for the next apple.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut in this game, since it's multi-apple, and there are multiple apples, I need to manage my path efficiently to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the movement of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (6,0), and it might move upwards to reach the apples.\n\nI need to avoid collision with it.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (4,3).\n\nSince my path is clear, I can proceed downwards.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that after moving down, I don't get blocked.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst move: DOWN to (4,6)\n\nSecond move: DOWN to (4,5)\n\nThird move: DOWN to (4,4)\n\nFourth move: DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nNow, after eating (4,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples:\n\n(3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4)\n\nLet's calculate distances from (4,3):\n\n(3,2): |4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n(0,5): |4-0| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n(8,5): |4-8| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n(1,4): |4-1| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (3,2), distance 2.\n\nSo, after eating (4,3), I should go for (3,2).\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,2):\n\nMOVE LEFT to (3,3)\n\nThen MOVE DOWN to (3,2)\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves are safe.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 3: A\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 7: .\n\nSo, moving to (3,3) is safe.\n\nThen moving down to (3,2):\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 2: A\n\nRow 3: A\n\nWait, there's already an apple at (3,2), so it's safe.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I grow again.\n\nNow, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving in a relatively open area, it should be manageable.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), the next closest apple is (1,4), distance 3.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (1,4):\n\nMOVE UP to (3,3)\n\nMOVE UP to (3,4)\n\nMOVE LEFT to (2,4)\n\nMOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nBut that's distance 4, which is more than the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nFrom (3,2) to (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nBut actually, the direct path would be:\n\nRIGHT to (4,2)\n\nUP to (4,3)\n\nUP to (4,4)\n\nLEFT to (3,4)\n\nLEFT to (2,4)\n\nLEFT to (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nUP to (3,3)\n\nUP to (3,4)\n\nLEFT to (2,4)\n\nLEFT to (1,4)\n\nThat's 4 moves.\n\nSo, that aligns with the Manhattan distance.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are better paths or if I might get blocked by the other snake.\n\nLooking at the board, snake 1 is at (6,0), and it might be moving upwards.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't cross its path.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the immediate goal of getting to (4,3) and then (3,2), it seems safe.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the situation again.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating two apples, I'll be longer, so I need to be more cautious about my tail.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with the initial plan.\n\nSo, first, move DOWN to (4,6).\n\nThen, continue DOWN to (4,5).\n\nThen, DOWN to (4,4).\n\nThen, DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, LEFT to (3,3).\n\nThen, DOWN to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, decide on the next apple.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable plan for now.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake 1's movements.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its last move, I'll assume it might move towards the apples as well."

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,6) to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2): |4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. (0,5): |4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (8,5): |4-8| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. (1,4): |4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. (4,3): |4-4| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the apple at (4,3) is closest with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and potential blockages.\n\nLooking at the board, snake 1 is at (6,0), and it's possible it will move upwards since there are apples above it.\n\nI need to plan a path to (4,3) without crossing paths with snake 1.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFrom (4,6), to get to (4,3), I need to move down 3 steps.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between (4,6) and (4,3), rows 5,4,3 are empty in column 4.\n\nWait, row 5 has an apple at (4,5), but that's not in my path.\n\nActually, my path would be:\n\n(4,6) -> (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3)\n\nChecking the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

A . . . . .\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 3: A\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 7: .\n\nSo, moving to (3,3) is safe.\n\nThen moving down to (3,2):\n\nRow 2: . . .

Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, from (3,2) to (1,4):\n\nDifference in x: 3-1 = 2\n\nDifference in y: 2-4 = -2, so 2\n\nTotal Manhattan distance: 4\n\nBut I thought it was 3 earlier, but that was a miscalculation.\n\nSo, the next closest is (1,4), distance 4.\n\nAlternatively, (0,5) is distance 6, and (8,5) is distance 6.\n\nSo, (1,4) is the next best option.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (1,4):\n\nOne possible path:\n\nMOVE UP to (3,3)\n\nMOVE UP to (3,4)\n\nMOVE LEFT to (2,4)\n\nMOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nThat's 4 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nI need to ensure that these moves are safe.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nSo, moving up from (3,2) to (3,3):\n\nRow 3: A\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 5: .\n\nNo issues.\n\nThen up to (3,4):\n\nRow 4: .

A . . . . . . . .\n\nColumn 1: no issues.\n\nLooks safe.\n\nAfter eating (1,4), I'll have grown again, so I need to be cautious with my tail.\n\nThen, the next apple is either (3,2), but I've already eaten that, or (0,5), (8,5), or (8,5).\n\nWait, no, I've eaten (4,3) and (3,2), so remaining are"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to navigate to pick up as many apples as possible without dying. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,6).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: .

There are five apples, and I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the moves and time spent.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|4-4| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nAh, the apple at (4,3) is the closest with a distance of 3. So, I should probably go for that one first.\n\nLet's plan the path to (4,3):\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,3):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 6: empty\n\n- Row 5: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nNow, after picking up (4,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (4,3) to each of these:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (3,2), distance 2.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,3) to (3,2):\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nLooks good.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I'll grow again, so I need to be careful with my tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple is (1,4), distance 4 from (3,2):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE UP to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE UP to (3,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nLet's check for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (2,4): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter picking up (1,4), the next closest apple would be either (0,5) or (8,5), both at distance 6 from my current position.\n\nI should probably choose one and go for it.\n\nLet's plan the path to (0,5) from (1,4):\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- MOVE UP to (0,5)\n\nBut wait, that's only two moves, which seems off from the Manhattan distance of 6. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 3, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 5 moves, but I thought it was 6 earlier. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nAnyway, I think I should prioritize the closer apples first to minimize the moves.\n\nBut let's think about the entire path.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,4)\n\n- DOWN to (4,3) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2) [eat apple]\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- UP to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5) [eat apple]\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake, snake #1, which is at (6,0) with no body.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming snake #1 moves upwards to get to the apples in row 5, I need to make sure I don't cross its path.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think the plan is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) after picking up (1,4), but that would require moving right across the board, which might put me in the path of snake #1 if it's moving upwards.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (0,5) first is better, as it's on the opposite side.\n\nBut actually, (0,5) is on the left side, and (8,5) is on the right side.\n\nWait, (0,5) is on the left, (8,5) is on the right.\n\nI'm currently on the left side, so maybe going for (0,5) first makes sense, then maybe loop around for (8,5).\n\nBut that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (3,2), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to calculate the total moves and see if it's feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and I need to decide just the next move, maybe I should focus on the immediate step.\n\nSo, my current position is (4,6), and the closest apple is (4,3).\n\nMy plan is to move DOWN to (4,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move DOWN to (4,4), and then DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll adjust my path based on the new board state and the positions of the other snake.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake #1's movements.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move is DOWN to (4,5).\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,7) to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2): |4-3| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. (0,5): |4-0| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5): |4-8| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4): |4-1| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n5.

I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,6) to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2): |4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. (0,5): |4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (8,5): |4-8| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. (1,4): |4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5.

Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 1 + 1 = 2, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 4 moves, not 6. I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nSo, total moves from (3,5) to (3,2) (3 moves), to (4,3) (2 moves), to (1,4) (4 moves), to (0,5) (2 moves), and finally to (8,5) (8 moves), totaling 19 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the other snake's movements and make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nLooking at snake #1, it's at (6,3) with no body.\n\nI need to predict its movements.\n\nAssuming it goes for the nearest apple, which is (8,5), distance |6-8| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSo, it might go for (8,5).\n\nI need to make sure that I reach (8,5) before snake #1 does.\n\nBut that's later in my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) earlier to block snake #1.\n\nBut that might be risky, as it's far away, and I might leave my current position exposed.\n\nI need to balance between picking up apples quickly and avoiding the other snake.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on picking up the closer apples first and then move towards the farther ones.\n\nAnother consideration is that as my snake grows, my tail extends, so I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nGiven that, maybe sticking to moving down and left initially is safer.\n\nSo, going for (3,2), then (4,3), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (8,5) without running into snake #1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (0,5) earlier to block snake #1 from getting to it.\n\nBut that might not be necessary if I can pick it up first.\n\nWait, snake #1 is at (6,3), and I'm at (3,5). It's on the opposite side.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up the apples that are closer to me first.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should go for (0,5) next after (3,2) and (4,3).\n\nBut that would require moving left to (0,5), which is a bit of a detour.\n\nWait, from (4,3), moving to (0,5) would be:\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- LEFT to (1,3)\n\n- LEFT to (0,3)\n\n- UP to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,3), I could go to (1,4) first, which is only 3 moves:\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4)\n\nWait, that's only 3 moves.\n\nThen, from (1,4) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThat's 2 more moves.\n\nTotal of 5 moves, same as the previous path.\n\nBut perhaps this way, I can pick up (1,4) along the way.\n\nI need to think about the sequence that allows me to pick up"

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,7) to each apple:\n\n1.

Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,6).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: .

There are five apples, and I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the moves and time spent.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|4-4| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nAh, the apple at (4,3) is the closest with a distance of 3. So, I should probably go for that one first.\n\nLet's plan the path to (4,3):\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,3):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 6: empty\n\n- Row 5: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nNow, after picking up (4,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (4,3) to each of these:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (3,2), distance 2.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,3) to (3,2):\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nLooks good.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I'll grow again, so I need to be careful with my tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple is (1,4), distance 4 from (3,2):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE UP to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE UP to (3,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nLet's check for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (2,4): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter picking up (1,4), the next closest apple would be either (0,5) or (8,5), both at distance 6 from my current position.\n\nI should probably choose one and go for it.\n\nLet's plan the path to (0,5) from (1,4):\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- MOVE UP to (0,5)\n\nBut wait, that's only two moves, which seems off from the Manhattan distance of 6. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 3, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 5 moves, but I thought it was 6 earlier. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nAnyway, I think I should prioritize the closer apples first to minimize the moves.\n\nBut let's think about the entire path.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,4)\n\n- DOWN to (4,3) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2) [eat apple]\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- UP to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5) [eat apple]\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake, snake #1, which is at (6,0) with no body.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming snake #1 moves upwards to get to the apples in row 5, I need to make sure I don't cross its path.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think the plan is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) after picking up (1,4), but that would require moving right across the board, which might put me in the path of snake #1 if it's moving upwards.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (0,5) first is better, as it's on the opposite side.\n\nBut actually, (0,5) is on the left side, and (8,5) is on the right side.\n\nWait, (0,5) is on the left, (8,5) is on the right.\n\nI'm currently on the left side, so maybe going for (0,5) first makes sense, then maybe loop around for (8,5).\n\nBut that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (3,2), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to calculate the total moves and see if it's feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and I need to decide just the next move, maybe I should focus on the immediate step.\n\nSo, my current position is (4,6), and the closest apple is (4,3).\n\nMy plan is to move DOWN to (4,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move DOWN to (4,4), and then DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll adjust my path based on the new board state and the positions of the other snake.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake #1's movements.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move is DOWN to (4,5).\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

So, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nActually, the apple at (3,5) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's a mistake. Let's double-check the initial apple positions: (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), (4,3). So, no apple at (3,5).

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,7) to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2): |4-3| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. (0,5): |4-0| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5): |4-8| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4): |4-1| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n5.

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,6).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board.

(3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5.

So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nNow, after picking up (4,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (4,3) to each of these:\n\n1.

Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 3, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 5 moves, but I thought it was 6 earlier. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nAnyway, I think I should prioritize the closer apples first to minimize the moves.\n\nBut let's think about the entire path.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,4)\n\n- DOWN to (4,3) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2) [eat apple]\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- UP to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5) [eat apple]\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake, snake #1, which is at (6,0) with no body.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming snake #1 moves upwards to get to the apples in row 5, I need to make sure I don't cross its path.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think the plan is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) after picking up (1,4), but that would require moving right across the board, which might put me in the path of snake #1 if it's moving upwards.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (0,5) first is better, as it's on the opposite side.\n\nBut actually, (0,5) is on the left side, and (8,5) is on the right side.\n\nWait, (0,5) is on the left, (8,5) is on the right.\n\nI'm currently on the left side, so maybe going for (0,5) first makes sense, then maybe loop around for (8,5).\n\nBut that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (3,2), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to calculate the total moves and see if it's feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and I need to decide just the next move, maybe I should focus on the immediate step.\n\nSo, my current position is (4,6), and the closest apple is (4,3).\n\nMy plan is to move DOWN to (4,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move DOWN to (4,4), and then DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll adjust my path based on the new board state and the positions of the other snake.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake #1's movements.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move is DOWN to (4,5).\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (3,5).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board.

There are five apples, and I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the moves and time spent.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|3-3| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|3-0| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|3-8| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|3-4| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nAll the apples except for (8,5) are at a distance of 3. So, I have multiple options for the closest apple.\n\nI should consider which one to go for first based on potential paths and possible interference from the other snake.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is directly below me.\n\n- (0,5) is to the left.\n\n- (1,4) is diagonally left and down.\n\n- (4,3) is to the right and down.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should consider the order in which I can pick them up efficiently.\n\nLet's consider going for (3,2) first since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 3\n\n- Row 3: empty at column 3\n\n- Row 2: apple at (3,2)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (3,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nThen, after picking up (3,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (3,2) to each of these:\n\n1. (0,5):\n\n|3-0| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. (8,5):\n\n|3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n3. (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4. (4,3):\n\n|3-4| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest is (4,3), distance 2.\n\nLet's plan the path from (3,2) to (4,3):\n\n- MOVE RIGHT to (4,2)\n\n- MOVE UP to (4,3)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n- (4,2): empty\n\n- (4,3): apple\n\nLooks good.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), I'll grow again, so I need to be careful with my tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple is (1,4), distance 4 from (4,3):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- MOVE UP to (2,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nLet's check for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (2,4): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter picking up (1,4), the next closest apple would be (0,5), distance 6 from (1,4):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- MOVE UP to (0,5)\n\nBut wait, that's only two moves, which seems off from the Manhattan distance of 6. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 1 + 1 = 2, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 4 moves, not 6. I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nSo, total moves from (3,5) to (3,2) (3 moves), to (4,3) (2 moves), to (1,4) (4 moves), to (0,5) (2 moves), and finally to (8,5) (8 moves), totaling 19 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the other snake's movements and make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nLooking at snake #1, it's at (6,3) with no body.\n\nI need to predict its movements.\n\nAssuming it goes for the nearest apple, which is (8,5), distance |6-8| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSo, it might go for (8,5).\n\nI need to make sure that I reach (8,5) before snake #1 does.\n\nBut that's later in my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) earlier to block snake #1.\n\nBut that might be risky, as it's far away, and I might leave my current position exposed.\n\nI need to balance between picking up apples quickly and avoiding the other snake.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on picking up the closer apples first and then move towards the farther ones.\n\nAnother consideration is that as my snake grows, my tail extends, so I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nGiven that, maybe sticking to moving down and left initially is safer.\n\nSo, going for (3,2), then (4,3), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (8,5) without running into snake #1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (0,5) earlier to block snake #1 from getting to it.\n\nBut that might not be necessary if I can pick it up first.\n\nWait, snake #1 is at (6,3), and I'm at (3,5). It's on the opposite side.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up the apples that are closer to me first.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should go for (0,5) next after (3,2) and (4,3).\n\nBut that would require moving left to (0,5), which is a bit of a detour.\n\nWait, from (4,3), moving to (0,5) would be:\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- LEFT to (1,3)\n\n- LEFT to (0,3)\n\n- UP to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,3), I could go to (1,4) first, which is only 3 moves:\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4)\n\nWait, that's only 3 moves.\n\nThen, from (1,4) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThat's 2 more moves.\n\nTotal of 5 moves, same as the previous path.\n\nBut perhaps this way, I can pick up (1,4) along the way.\n\nI need to think about the sequence that allows me to pick up"

So, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nActually, the apple at (3,5) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's a mistake. Let's double-check the initial apple positions: (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), (4,3). So, no apple at (3,5).

So, I have multiple options for the closest apple.\n\nI should consider which one to go for first based on potential paths and possible interference from the other snake.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is directly below me.\n\n- (0,5) is to the left.\n\n- (1,4) is diagonally left and down.\n\n- (4,3) is to the right and down.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should consider going for (3,2) first since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 4: apple at (1,4)\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\n- Row 2: apple at (3,2)\n\nIt seems that column 3 is clear from row 5 to row 2, except for the apple at (3,2), but that's an apple, so it's okay.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the other snake's position. Snake #1 is at (6,5), which is in row 5, column 6.\n\nSo, if I move down to (3,4), which is row 4, column 3.\n\nAt row 4, column 3, there are no obstacles.\n\nThen, moving down to (3,3), which is row 3, column 3.\n\nAt row 3, column 3, there's no apple or snake.\n\nFinally, moving down to (3,2), which is row 2, column 3.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I should consider if the other snake might interfere.\n\nSnake #1 is at (6,5), which is in row 5, column 6.\n\nIf it moves left or right, it might cross my path, but for now, it's not in my way.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the sequence of moves.\n\nIf I move down three times, I'll pick up the apple at (3,2), which will extend my snake by one unit.\n\nAfter picking up the apple, I need to plan for the next apple.\n\nLet's see, after picking up (3,2), I can consider going for (0,5), which is to the left.\n\nFrom (3,2), to (0,5):\n\n- Move LEFT three times, then UP three times.\n\nBut wait, moving left from (3,2) to (0,2) would take me to column 0, row 2.\n\nBut the apple is at (0,5), which is column 0, row 5.\n\nSo, I need to move UP three times from (0,2) to (0,5).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,2)\n\n- UP to (0,3)\n\n- UP to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (1,4) next, which is closer.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- LEFT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\nThis is four moves compared to the six moves to (0,5).\n\nBut, I need to see which one is more efficient.\n\nWait, actually, to get from (3,2) to (1,4), it's:\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- LEFT to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nTo get from (3,2) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT three times to (0,2)\n\n- UP three times to (0,5)\n\nThat's also six moves.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can optimize.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up (3,2), I can go for (4,3), which is adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (4,3)\n\nThat's only two moves.\n\nThen, from (4,3), I can go to (1,4), which is:\n\n- LEFT three times to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nSo, total moves would be 1 (to (4,3)) + 2 (to (1,4)) + ??\n\nWait, perhaps planning all at once would be better.\n\nLet me think about the order in which to pick up the apples to minimize total moves.\n\nThis is similar to the traveling salesman problem, where I need to visit multiple points with the shortest path.\n\nBut since time is limited, I'll try to find a reasonable path.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (3,2)\n\n2. (0,5)\n\n3. (8,5)\n\n4. (1,4)\n\n5. (4,3)\n\nI'm currently at (3,5).\n\nFirst, go to (3,2), which is down 3.\n\nThen, from (3,2), go to (4,3):\n\n- RIGHT to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (4,3)\n\nThen, from (4,3), go to (1,4):\n\n- LEFT three times to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\nThen, from (1,4), go to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nFinally, from (0,5), go to (8,5):\n\n- RIGHT eight times to (8,5)\n\nThis seems a bit inefficient, but it's one possible path.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up (3,2), go to (4,3), then to (8,5), then to (1,4), then to (0,5).\n\nLet me calculate the moves:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2): DOWN 3\n\nFrom (3,2) to (4,3): RIGHT 1, UP 1\n\nFrom (4,3) to (8,5): RIGHT 4, UP 2\n\nFrom (8,5) to (1,4): LEFT 7, DOWN 1\n\nFrom (1,4) to (0,5): LEFT 1, UP 1\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 2 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 21 moves\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n(3,2) -> (1,4) -> (0,5) -> (4,3) -> (8,5)\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2): DOWN 3\n\nFrom (3,2) to (1,4): LEFT 2, UP 2\n\nFrom (1,4) to (0,5): LEFT 1, UP 1\n\nFrom (0,5) to (4,3): RIGHT 4, DOWN 2\n\nFrom (4,3) to (8"

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential paths.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (4,7) to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2): |4-3| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. (0,5): |4-0| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5): |4-8| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4): |4-1| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n5.

(3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|4-4| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nAh, the apple at (4,3) is the closest with a distance of 3. So, I should probably go for that one first.\n\nLet's plan the path to (4,3):\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,3):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 6: empty\n\n- Row 5: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nNow, after picking up (4,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (4,3) to each of these:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (3,2), distance 2.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,3) to (3,2):\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nLooks good.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I'll grow again, so I need to be careful with my tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple is (1,4), distance 4 from (3,2):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE UP to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE UP to (3,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nLet's check for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (2,4): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter picking up (1,4), the next closest apple would be either (0,5) or (8,5), both at distance 6 from my current position.\n\nI should probably choose one and go for it.\n\nLet's plan the path to (0,5) from (1,4):\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- MOVE UP to (0,5)\n\nBut wait, that's only two moves, which seems off from the Manhattan distance of 6. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 3, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 5 moves, but I thought it was 6 earlier. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nAnyway, I think I should prioritize the closer apples first to minimize the moves.\n\nBut let's think about the entire path.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,4)\n\n- DOWN to (4,3) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2) [eat apple]\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- UP to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5) [eat apple]\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake, snake #1, which is at (6,0) with no body.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming snake #1 moves upwards to get to the apples in row 5, I need to make sure I don't cross its path.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think the plan is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) after picking up (1,4), but that would require moving right across the board, which might put me in the path of snake #1 if it's moving upwards.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (0,5) first is better, as it's on the opposite side.\n\nBut actually, (0,5) is on the left side, and (8,5) is on the right side.\n\nWait, (0,5) is on the left, (8,5) is on the right.\n\nI'm currently on the left side, so maybe going for (0,5) first makes sense, then maybe loop around for (8,5).\n\nBut that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (3,2), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to calculate the total moves and see if it's feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and I need to decide just the next move, maybe I should focus on the immediate step.\n\nSo, my current position is (4,6), and the closest apple is (4,3).\n\nMy plan is to move DOWN to (4,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move DOWN to (4,4), and then DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll adjust my path based on the new board state and the positions of the other snake.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake #1's movements.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move is DOWN to (4,5).\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (3,5).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board.

(3,2):\n\n|3-3| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|3-0| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|3-8| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5.

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,6).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board.

(3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|4-4| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nAh, the apple at (4,3) is the closest with a distance of 3. So, I should probably go for that one first.\n\nLet's plan the path to (4,3):\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,3):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 6: empty\n\n- Row 5: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nNow, after picking up (4,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (4,3) to each of these:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (3,2), distance 2.\n\nLet's plan the path from (4,3) to (3,2):\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nLooks good.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I'll grow again, so I need to be careful with my tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple is (1,4), distance 4 from (3,2):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE UP to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE UP to (3,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nLet's check for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (3,4): empty\n\n- (2,4): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter picking up (1,4), the next closest apple would be either (0,5) or (8,5), both at distance 6 from my current position.\n\nI should probably choose one and go for it.\n\nLet's plan the path to (0,5) from (1,4):\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- MOVE UP to (0,5)\n\nBut wait, that's only two moves, which seems off from the Manhattan distance of 6. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 3, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 5 moves, but I thought it was 6 earlier. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nAnyway, I think I should prioritize the closer apples first to minimize the moves.\n\nBut let's think about the entire path.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,4)\n\n- DOWN to (4,3) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2) [eat apple]\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- UP to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5) [eat apple]\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake, snake #1, which is at (6,0) with no body.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming snake #1 moves upwards to get to the apples in row 5, I need to make sure I don't cross its path.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think the plan is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) after picking up (1,4), but that would require moving right across the board, which might put me in the path of snake #1 if it's moving upwards.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (0,5) first is better, as it's on the opposite side.\n\nBut actually, (0,5) is on the left side, and (8,5) is on the right side.\n\nWait, (0,5) is on the left, (8,5) is on the right.\n\nI'm currently on the left side, so maybe going for (0,5) first makes sense, then maybe loop around for (8,5).\n\nBut that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (3,2), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to calculate the total moves and see if it's feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and I need to decide just the next move, maybe I should focus on the immediate step.\n\nSo, my current position is (4,6), and the closest apple is (4,3).\n\nMy plan is to move DOWN to (4,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move DOWN to (4,4), and then DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll adjust my path based on the new board state and the positions of the other snake.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake #1's movements.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move is DOWN to (4,5).\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (3,5).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . 2 . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: .

There are five apples, and I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the moves and time spent.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|3-3| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|3-0| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|3-8| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|3-4| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nAll the apples except for (8,5) are at a distance of 3. So, I have multiple options for the closest apple.\n\nI should consider which one to go for first based on potential paths and possible interference from the other snake.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is directly below me.\n\n- (0,5) is to the left.\n\n- (1,4) is diagonally left and down.\n\n- (4,3) is to the right and down.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should consider the order in which I can pick them up efficiently.\n\nLet's consider going for (3,2) first since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 3\n\n- Row 3: empty at column 3\n\n- Row 2: apple at (3,2)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (3,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nThen, after picking up (3,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (3,2) to each of these:\n\n1. (0,5):\n\n|3-0| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. (8,5):\n\n|3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n3. (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4. (4,3):\n\n|3-4| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest is (4,3), distance 2.\n\nLet's plan the path from (3,2) to (4,3):\n\n- MOVE RIGHT to (4,2)\n\n- MOVE UP to (4,3)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n- (4,2): empty\n\n- (4,3): apple\n\nLooks good.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), I'll grow again, so I need to be careful with my tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple is (1,4), distance 4 from (4,3):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- MOVE UP to (2,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nLet's check for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (2,4): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter picking up (1,4), the next closest apple would be (0,5), distance 6 from (1,4):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- MOVE UP to (0,5)\n\nBut wait, that's only two moves, which seems off from the Manhattan distance of 6. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 1 + 1 = 2, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 4 moves, not 6. I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nSo, total moves from (3,5) to (3,2) (3 moves), to (4,3) (2 moves), to (1,4) (4 moves), to (0,5) (2 moves), and finally to (8,5) (8 moves), totaling 19 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the other snake's movements and make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nLooking at snake #1, it's at (6,3) with no body.\n\nI need to predict its movements.\n\nAssuming it goes for the nearest apple, which is (8,5), distance |6-8| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSo, it might go for (8,5).\n\nI need to make sure that I reach (8,5) before snake #1 does.\n\nBut that's later in my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) earlier to block snake #1.\n\nBut that might be risky, as it's far away, and I might leave my current position exposed.\n\nI need to balance between picking up apples quickly and avoiding the other snake.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on picking up the closer apples first and then move towards the farther ones.\n\nAnother consideration is that as my snake grows, my tail extends, so I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nGiven that, maybe sticking to moving down and left initially is safer.\n\nSo, going for (3,2), then (4,3), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (8,5) without running into snake #1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (0,5) earlier to block snake #1 from getting to it.\n\nBut that might not be necessary if I can pick it up first.\n\nWait, snake #1 is at (6,3), and I'm at (3,5). It's on the opposite side.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up the apples that are closer to me first.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should go for (0,5) next after (3,2) and (4,3).\n\nBut that would require moving left to (0,5), which is a bit of a detour.\n\nWait, from (4,3), moving to (0,5) would be:\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- LEFT to (1,3)\n\n- LEFT to (0,3)\n\n- UP to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,3), I could go to (1,4) first, which is only 3 moves:\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4)\n\nWait, that's only 3 moves.\n\nThen, from (1,4) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThat's 2 more moves.\n\nTotal of 5 moves, same as the previous path.\n\nBut perhaps this way, I can pick up (1,4) along the way.\n\nI need to think about the sequence that allows me to pick up"

So, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nActually, the apple at (3,5) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's a mistake. Let's double-check the initial apple positions: (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), (4,3). So, no apple at (3,5).

I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,6).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board.

There are five apples, and I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the moves and time spent.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|4-4| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nAh, the apple at (4,3) is the closest with a distance of 3. So, I should probably go for that one first.\n\nLet's plan the path to (4,3):\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,3):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 6: empty\n\n- Row 5: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nNow, after picking up (4,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (4,3) to each of these:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4.

Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 3, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 5 moves, but I thought it was 6 earlier. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nAnyway, I think I should prioritize the closer apples first to minimize the moves.\n\nBut let's think about the entire path.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,4)\n\n- DOWN to (4,3) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2) [eat apple]\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- UP to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5) [eat apple]\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake, snake #1, which is at (6,0) with no body.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming snake #1 moves upwards to get to the apples in row 5, I need to make sure I don't cross its path.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think the plan is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) after picking up (1,4), but that would require moving right across the board, which might put me in the path of snake #1 if it's moving upwards.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (0,5) first is better, as it's on the opposite side.\n\nBut actually, (0,5) is on the left side, and (8,5) is on the right side.\n\nWait, (0,5) is on the left, (8,5) is on the right.\n\nI'm currently on the left side, so maybe going for (0,5) first makes sense, then maybe loop around for (8,5).\n\nBut that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (3,2), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to calculate the total moves and see if it's feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and I need to decide just the next move, maybe I should focus on the immediate step.\n\nSo, my current position is (4,6), and the closest apple is (4,3).\n\nMy plan is to move DOWN to (4,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move DOWN to (4,4), and then DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll adjust my path based on the new board state and the positions of the other snake.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake #1's movements.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move is DOWN to (4,5).\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (3,5).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board.

There are five apples, and I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the moves and time spent.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|3-3| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|3-0| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|3-8| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|3-4| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nAll the apples except for (8,5) are at a distance of 3. So, I have multiple options for the closest apple.\n\nI should consider which one to go for first based on potential paths and possible interference from the other snake.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is directly below me.\n\n- (0,5) is to the left.\n\n- (1,4) is diagonally left and down.\n\n- (4,3) is to the right and down.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should consider the order in which I can pick them up efficiently.\n\nLet's consider going for (3,2) first since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 3\n\n- Row 3: empty at column 3\n\n- Row 2: apple at (3,2)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (3,2).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nThen, after picking up (3,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (3,2) to each of these:\n\n1. (0,5):\n\n|3-0| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. (8,5):\n\n|3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n3. (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4. (4,3):\n\n|3-4| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest is (4,3), distance 2.\n\nLet's plan the path from (3,2) to (4,3):\n\n- MOVE RIGHT to (4,2)\n\n- MOVE UP to (4,3)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n- (4,2): empty\n\n- (4,3): apple\n\nLooks good.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), I'll grow again, so I need to be careful with my tail.\n\nThen, the next closest apple is (1,4), distance 4 from (4,3):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- MOVE UP to (2,4)\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (1,4)\n\nLet's check for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): empty\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (2,4): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nAfter picking up (1,4), the next closest apple would be (0,5), distance 6 from (1,4):\n\nPath:\n\n- MOVE LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- MOVE UP to (0,5)\n\nBut wait, that's only two moves, which seems off from the Manhattan distance of 6. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 1 + 1 = 2, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 4 moves, not 6. I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nSo, total moves from (3,5) to (3,2) (3 moves), to (4,3) (2 moves), to (1,4) (4 moves), to (0,5) (2 moves), and finally to (8,5) (8 moves), totaling 19 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the other snake's movements and make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nLooking at snake #1, it's at (6,3) with no body.\n\nI need to predict its movements.\n\nAssuming it goes for the nearest apple, which is (8,5), distance |6-8| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSo, it might go for (8,5).\n\nI need to make sure that I reach (8,5) before snake #1 does.\n\nBut that's later in my path.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) earlier to block snake #1.\n\nBut that might be risky, as it's far away, and I might leave my current position exposed.\n\nI need to balance between picking up apples quickly and avoiding the other snake.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on picking up the closer apples first and then move towards the farther ones.\n\nAnother consideration is that as my snake grows, my tail extends, so I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nGiven that, maybe sticking to moving down and left initially is safer.\n\nSo, going for (3,2), then (4,3), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that I can reach (8,5) without running into snake #1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (0,5) earlier to block snake #1 from getting to it.\n\nBut that might not be necessary if I can pick it up first.\n\nWait, snake #1 is at (6,3), and I'm at (3,5). It's on the opposite side.\n\nI need to prioritize picking up the apples that are closer to me first.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should go for (0,5) next after (3,2) and (4,3).\n\nBut that would require moving left to (0,5), which is a bit of a detour.\n\nWait, from (4,3), moving to (0,5) would be:\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,3)\n\n- LEFT to (1,3)\n\n- LEFT to (0,3)\n\n- UP to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,3), I could go to (1,4) first, which is only 3 moves:\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4)\n\nWait, that's only 3 moves.\n\nThen, from (1,4) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nThat's 2 more moves.\n\nTotal of 5 moves, same as the previous path.\n\nBut perhaps this way, I can pick up (1,4) along the way.\n\nI need to think about the sequence that allows me to pick up"

So, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nActually, the apple at (3,5) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's a mistake. Let's double-check the initial apple positions: (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), (4,3). So, no apple at (3,5).

From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . 1 . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . 2 . . . A .\n\nRow 4: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,5), which is in row 5, column 4.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the moves and time spent.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|4-1| + |5-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|4-4| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,3), which is directly below me at a distance of 2.\n\nLet's consider going for (4,3) first.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,3):\n\n- Move DOWN two times.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 4: There's an apple at (1,4), but that's not in my path.\n\n- Row 3: There's an apple at (4,3), which is my target.\n\nIt seems clear.\n\nAfter picking up (4,3), my snake will grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nNext, I should choose another apple. Let's see the distances from (4,3):\n\n1. (3,2): |4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. (0,5): |4-0| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5): |4-8| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. (1,4): |4-1| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,2), which is two moves away.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,2):\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n- (3,3): no obstacles\n\n- (3,2): apple\n\nGood.\n\nAfter picking up (3,2), I should look for the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (8,5): |3-8| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (1,4): |3-1| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, (1,4) is the closest at a distance of 4.\n\nPath from (3,2) to (1,4):\n\n- LEFT to (2,2)\n\n- LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- UP to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\nCheck for obstacles:\n\n- (2,2): clear\n\n- (1,2): clear\n\n- (1,3): clear\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nGood.\n\nAfter picking up (1,4), next closest apple would be (0,5):\n\nFrom (1,4) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5)\n\nCheck for obstacles:\n\n- (0,4): clear\n\n- (0,5): apple\n\nGood.\n\nThen, finally, (8,5):\n\nFrom (0,5) to (8,5):\n\n- RIGHT eight times to (8,5)\n\nCheck for obstacles:\n\n- Need to make sure no snakes are in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, Snake #1 is at (6,8), which is at row 8, column 6.\n\nIf I move right from (0,5) to (8,5), I need to ensure that Snake #1 doesn't block my path.\n\nAssuming Snake #1 doesn't move into my way, the path should be clear.\n\nSo, overall plan:\n\n1. DOWN to (4,4)\n\n2. DOWN to (4,3) - pick up apple\n\n3. LEFT to (3,3)\n\n4. DOWN to (3,2) - pick up apple\n\n5. LEFT to (2,2)\n\n6. LEFT to (1,2)\n\n7. UP to (1,3)\n\n8. UP to (1,4) - pick up apple\n\n9. LEFT to (0,4)\n\n10. UP to (0,5) - pick up apple\n\n11. RIGHT to (1,5)\n\n12. RIGHT to (2,5)\n\n13. RIGHT to (3,5)\n\n14. RIGHT to (4,5)\n\n15. RIGHT to (5,5)\n\n16. RIGHT to (6,5)\n\n17. RIGHT to (7,5)\n\n18. RIGHT to (8,5) - pick up apple\n\nThis seems a bit long, but it's a straightforward path.\n\nI should also consider if there's a shorter path or if I can pick up more apples along the way.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up (4,3) and (3,2), I could go to (8,5) directly.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (8,5):\n\n- RIGHT five times to (8,2)\n\n- UP three times to (8,5)\n\nThat's 5 + 3 = 8 moves.\n\nThen, go back to pick up (1,4) and (0,5).\n\nBut, that might not be efficient, as going back would take more moves.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up (4,3) and (3,2), I could go to (8,5), then to (1,4), and finally to (0,5).\n\nBut, that seems inefficient due to the distance between (8,5) and (1,4).\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider picking up the apples in a different order.\n\nLet me think about the positions again:\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\nMaybe group the apples that are closer together.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. (4,3)\n\n2. (3,2)\n\n3. (1,4)\n\n4. (0,5)\n\n5. (8,5)\n\nThis seems logical, as the first four are clustered together, and (8,5) is separate.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial plan.\n\nNow, for this turn, I should move DOWN to (4,4).\n\nBut, wait, there's an apple at (4,3), which is below me.\n\nActually, from (4,5) to (4,3), I need to move DOWN two times.\n\nSo, first move should be DOWN.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving DOWN is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 4 is empty except for the apple at (1,4), which is not in my path.\n\nSo, moving DOWN to (4,4) is safe.\n\nThen, moving DOWN again to (4,3) to pick up the apple.\n\nThen, LEFT to (3,3), then DOWN to (3,2) to pick up the apple.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI should also consider if the other snake might move into my path.\n\nSnake #1 is at (6,8), and its body is empty, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate its possible moves.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves down, it would go to (6,7), then (6,6), and so on.\n\nIf it moves left, it would go to (5,8), then (4,8), etc.\n\nIn any case, it's quite far from my"

I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x, down is decreasing y, and up is increasing y.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . .

(4,3):\n\n|4-4| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nAh, the apple at (4,3) is the closest with a distance of 3. So, I should probably go for that one first.\n\nLet's plan the path to (4,3):\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,3):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 6: empty\n\n- Row 5: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 4: empty at column 4\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\nLooks clear. So, I can safely move down three times to reach the apple at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,3), I'll grow, so my tail will extend. But since I'm moving in a straight line, my tail will just follow.\n\nNow, after picking up (4,3), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (4,3) to each of these:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|4-0| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|4-8| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4.

Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, the Manhattan distance is |1-0| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to double-check my distance calculations.\n\nEarlier, from (4,3), distance to (1,4) was 3, and from (1,4) to (0,5) is 1 + 1 = 2, so total 5 moves, but I thought it was 6 earlier. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nAnyway, I think I should prioritize the closer apples first to minimize the moves.\n\nBut let's think about the entire path.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,4)\n\n- DOWN to (4,3) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- DOWN to (3,2) [eat apple]\n\n- UP to (3,3)\n\n- UP to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)\n\n- LEFT to (1,4) [eat apple]\n\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n\n- UP to (0,5) [eat apple]\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake, snake #1, which is at (6,0) with no body.\n\nI need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAssuming snake #1 moves upwards to get to the apples in row 5, I need to make sure I don't cross its path.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think the plan is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,5) after picking up (1,4), but that would require moving right across the board, which might put me in the path of snake #1 if it's moving upwards.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (0,5) first is better, as it's on the opposite side.\n\nBut actually, (0,5) is on the left side, and (8,5) is on the right side.\n\nWait, (0,5) is on the left, (8,5) is on the right.\n\nI'm currently on the left side, so maybe going for (0,5) first makes sense, then maybe loop around for (8,5).\n\nBut that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (3,2), then (1,4), then (0,5), and finally (8,5).\n\nBut I need to calculate the total moves and see if it's feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that it's turn-based, and I need to decide just the next move, maybe I should focus on the immediate step.\n\nSo, my current position is (4,6), and the closest apple is (4,3).\n\nMy plan is to move DOWN to (4,5).\n\nThen, next turn, move DOWN to (4,4), and then DOWN to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll adjust my path based on the new board state and the positions of the other snake.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake #1's movements.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move is DOWN to (4,5).\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

So, I have multiple options for the closest apple.\n\nI should consider which one to go for first based on potential paths and possible interference from the other snake.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is directly below me.\n\n- (0,5) is to the left and down.\n\n- (1,4) is diagonally left and down.\n\n- (4,3) is to the right and down.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should consider going for (3,2) first since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (3,2):\n\n- Move DOWN four times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 5: apple at (3,5)\n\n- Row 4: apple at (1,4)\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\n- Row 2: apple at (3,2)\n\nIt seems that column 3 is clear from row 6 to row 2, except for the apple at (3,5), but that's an apple, so it's okay.\n\nWait, but if I move down to (3,5), there's an apple there. So, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nActually, the apple at (3,5) isn't listed in the initial apple positions, so maybe it's a mistake. Let's double-check the initial apple positions: (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), (4,3). So, no apple at (3,5). Maybe it's my snake's position.\n\nWait, my snake is at (3,6), and the board shows in row 6, column 3: 2, which is me. Row 5 shows an 'A' at column 4, which is (4,5), but according to the list, apples are at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), (4,3). There seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\nRow 5: A . . 2 . . . . A .\n\nSo, in row 5, column 0: A (apple at (0,5))\n\nColumn 3: 2 (me at (3,5))\n\nColumn 8: A (apple at (8,5))\n\nWait, but I'm at (3,6), not (3,5). Maybe the board is misaligned.\n\nWait, in the board, row numbers decrease from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, row 9 is the top row, row 0 is the bottom row.\n\nGiven that, my position at (3,6) is in row 6, column 3.\n\nApples are at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), (4,3).\n\nLooking at row 5: A . . 2 . . . . A .\n\nSo, in row 5, column 0: A (apple at (0,5))\n\nColumn 3: 2 (me at (3,5)), but I'm actually at (3,6). Hmm, perhaps there's confusion in row numbering.\n\nWait, perhaps row 0 is at the top, and row 9 at the bottom. Let's check.\n\nIn the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: .

A . . . . 1 . . .\n\nRow 3 has . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 2 has . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: all dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- Row 5, column 0: (0,5)\n\n- Row 5, column 8: (8,5)\n\n- Row 4, column 1: (1,4)\n\n- Row 3, column 4: (4,3)\n\n- Row 2, column 3: (3,2)\n\nAnd I'm at row 6, column 3: (3,6)\n\nSnake #1 is at row 4, column 6: (6,4), but according to the positions you provided, it's at (6,4), but in the board, it's at row 4, column 6.\n\nWait, there's inconsistency in how rows and columns are being indexed.\n\nIn the board, rows are from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom.\n\nColumns are from left to right, 0 to 9.\n\nSo, position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nTherefore, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nApples:\n\n- (0,5): column 0, row 5\n\n- (8,5): column 8, row 5\n\n- (1,4): column 1, row 4\n\n- (4,3): column 4, row 3\n\n- (3,2): column 3, row 2\n\nSnake #1 is at (6,4): column 6, row 4\n\nOkay, now I need to plan my path accordingly.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move left, right, up, or down, avoiding the other snake and the walls.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible before dying.\n\nI should prioritize apples that are closer and ensure that I don't get blocked by the other snake.\n\nLet me consider the distances again.\n\nFrom (3,6):\n\n- To (3,2): |6-2| = 4 down\n\n- To (0,5): |3-0| + |6-5| = 3 left, 1 down\n\n- To (8,5): |3-8| + |6-5| = 5 right, 1 down\n\n- To (1,4): |3-1| + |6-4| = 2 left, 2 down\n\n- To (4,3): |3-4| + |6-3| = 1 right, 3 down\n\nSo, the closest apples are (3,2),"

Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (3,2), (0,5), (8,5), (1,4), and (4,3). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (3,5).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . 1 . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . 2 . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: .

There are five apples, and I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the moves and time spent.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (3,2):\n\n|3-3| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n2. (0,5):\n\n|3-0| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n3. (8,5):\n\n|3-8| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n4. (1,4):\n\n|3-1| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n5. (4,3):\n\n|3-4| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,2), (0,5), (1,4), and (4,3), all at a distance of 3.\n\nI should consider which one to go for first based on potential paths and possible interference from the other snake.\n\nLet's look at the positions:\n\n- (3,2) is directly below me.\n\n- (0,5) is to the left.\n\n- (1,4) is to the left and up.\n\n- (4,3) is to the right and down.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should consider going for (3,2) first since it's directly below me.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2):\n\n- Move DOWN three times.\n\nSo, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 4: apple at (1,4)\n\n- Row 3: apple at (4,3)\n\n- Row 2: apple at (3,2)\n\nIt seems that column 3 is clear from row 5 to row 2, except for the apple at (3,2), but that's an apple, so it's okay.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the other snake's position. Snake #1 is at (6,7), which is in row 7, column 6.\n\nSo, if I move down to (3,4), which is row 4, column 3.\n\nAt row 4, column 3, there's an apple at (1,4), but that's not in my way.\n\nThen, moving down to (3,3), which is row 3, column 3.\n\nAt row 3, column 3, there's an apple at (4,3), but that's not in my direct path.\n\nFinally, moving down to (3,2), which is row 2, column 3.\n\nSo, the path seems clear.\n\nBut I should consider if the other snake might interfere.\n\nSnake #1 is at (6,7), which is in row 7, column 6.\n\nIf it moves up or left, it might cross my path, but for now, it's not in my way.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the sequence of moves.\n\nIf I move down three times, I'll pick up the apple at (3,2), which will extend my snake by one unit.\n\nAfter picking up the apple, I need to plan for the next apple.\n\nLet's see, after picking up (3,2), I can consider going for (1,4), which is to the left.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- LEFT two times to (1,2)\n\n- UP two times to (1,4)\n\nBut wait, moving left from (3,2) to (1,2), I need to make sure there are no obstacles.\n\nAt (2,2), there's no apple or snake.\n\nAt (1,2), same.\n\nThen, moving up to (1,3) and (1,4), which are clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider picking up (4,3) next, which is adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (4,3)\n\nThat's only two moves compared to the four moves to (1,4).\n\nBut, after picking up (4,3), I'd need to go to (1,4), which would require moving left three times and up one time.\n\nTotal moves would be:\n\n- DOWN, DOWN, DOWN to (3,2)\n\n- RIGHT, UP to (4,3)\n\n- LEFT three times to (1,3)\n\n- UP to (1,4)\n\nThat's 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going directly to (1,4):\n\n- DOWN, DOWN, DOWN to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT, LEFT to (1,2)\n\n- UP, UP to (1,4)\n\nThat's 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 moves.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (1,4) directly is faster.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of other snakes and potential blockages.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,5), which is further left, and (8,5), which is further right.\n\nI should think about the overall strategy.\n\nMaybe I should aim to pick up the apples in a way that allows me to cover the board efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the positions again:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\nOne possible path could be:\n\n1. (3,5) -> (3,2) -> (1,4) -> (0,5) -> (4,3) -> (8,5)\n\nLet's calculate the moves:\n\n- FROM (3,5) TO (3,2): DOWN 3 (3 moves)\n\n- FROM (3,2) TO (1,4): LEFT 2, UP 2 (4 moves)\n\n- FROM (1,4) TO (0,5): LEFT 1, UP 1 (2 moves)\n\n- FROM (0,5) TO (4,3): RIGHT 4, DOWN 2 (6 moves)\n\n- FROM (4,3) TO (8,5): RIGHT 4, UP 2 (6 moves)\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 6 = 21 moves\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n1. (3,5) -> (4,3) -> (3,2) -> (1,4) -> (0,5) -> (8,5)\n\nMoves:\n\n- FROM (3,5) TO (4,3): RIGHT 1, DOWN 2 (3 moves)\n\n- FROM (4,3) TO (3,2): LEFT 1, DOWN 1 (2 moves)\n\n- FROM (3,2) TO (1,4): LEFT 2, UP 2 (4 moves)\n\n- FROM (1,4) TO (0,5): LEFT 1, UP 1 (2 moves)\n\n- FROM (0,5) TO (8,5): RIGHT 8 (8 moves)\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 19 moves\n\nThis seems more efficient.\n\nAnother possible path:\n\n1. (3,5) -> (3,2) -> (4,3) -> (1,4) -> (0,5) -> (8,5)\n\nMoves:\n\n- FROM (3,5) TO (3,2): DOWN 3 (3 moves)\n\n- FROM (3,2) TO (4,3): RIGHT 1, UP 1 (2 moves)\n\n- FROM (4,3) TO (1,4): LEFT 3, UP 1 (4 moves)\n\n- FROM (1,4) TO (0,5): LEFT 1, UP 1 (2 moves)\n\n- FROM (0,5) TO (8,5): RIGHT 8 (8 moves)\n\nTotal moves: 3 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 19 moves\n\nSame as the previous path.\n\nAlternatively"

(8,5)\n\nThis seems logical, as the first four are clustered together, and (8,5) is separate.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial plan.\n\nNow, for this turn, I should move DOWN to (4,4).\n\nBut, wait, there's an apple at (4,3), which is below me.\n\nActually, from (4,5) to (4,3), I need to move DOWN two times.\n\nSo, first move should be DOWN.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving DOWN is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, row 4 is empty except for the apple at (1,4), which is not in my path.\n\nSo, moving DOWN to (4,4) is safe.\n\nThen, moving DOWN again to (4,3) to pick up the apple.\n\nThen, LEFT to (3,3), then DOWN to (3,2) to pick up the apple.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI should also consider if the other snake might move into my path.\n\nSnake #1 is at (6,8), and its body is empty, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate its possible moves.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves down, it would go to (6,7), then (6,6), and so on.\n\nIf it moves left, it would go to (5,8), then (4,8), etc.\n\nIn any case, it's quite far from my current"
