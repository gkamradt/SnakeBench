Moving in that direction seems like a good plan to collect the first apple and increase my score.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake at (4, 7) and its body part at (4, 6). I don't want to collide with it, so I'll need to maintain a safe distance while maneuvering towards the apple.\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples at (8, 3), (0, 3), and (1, 6) that I should keep in mind for future moves. Collecting them would also be beneficial, but I'll need to prioritize my movements carefully.\n\nLastly, I should be mindful of the board boundaries and avoid colliding with the walls.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe my best next move would be to go DOWN.\n\nDOWN\n\n*Next turn strategy*\n\nFor my next move, I will continue to focus on collecting the apple at (3, 1) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. If possible, I may also try to position myself to collect the apple at (0, 3) in the future. I will need to be cautious of the board boundaries and avoid any collisions.\n\nDOWN"
