Move RIGHT to (2, 5): This moves me closer to the apple at (4, 3), but it puts me right next to the enemy snake's body, which is very risky.\n\n3.

If it moves away from the apple at (4, 3), I can consider pursuing that one. If it moves closer to (4, 3) or stays nearby, I should instead focus on the apples at (7, 2) and (8, 8). My path to those apples is currently clear, so I should take advantage of that. I'll need to be cautious of the enemy snake potentially looping around to cut me off, so I should try to reach the apples efficiently while keeping an escape route open. If I can successfully eat one or both of those apples, I'll have more room to maneuver in the top half of the board and can then reassess my options for the remaining apples.\n\nUP"

Move RIGHT to (8, 9): This allows me to eat the apple at (9, 7) if the enemy snake moves RIGHT. If it moves UP, I'll be adjacent to it, which is risky.\n\n2. Move DOWN to (7, 8): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 8) but also puts me closer to the enemy snake. It's a bit risky.\n\n3. Move LEFT to (6, 9): This moves me away from both the apples and the enemy snake. It doesn't provide any immediate benefit but could be a safe stalling move.\n\nI think the best move is to go RIGHT to (8, 9). This puts me in a position to eat the apple at (9, 7) if the enemy snake moves RIGHT. If it moves UP, I'll be adjacent to it, but I'll have the option to move DOWN and eat the apple at (8, 8) on the next turn. This move maximizes my chances of eating an apple while minimizing the risk from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT, if the enemy snake moves RIGHT, I can move UP to eat the apple at (9, 7). If it moves UP, I can move DOWN to eat the apple at (8, 8). If it moves LEFT or DOWN, I can reevaluate my options based on its new position. The priority should be to eat the nearby apples safely while keeping an escape route available.\n\nRIGHT"

Going UP would:\n   - Lead to (9, 8)\n   - Not immediately get an apple but position me closer to apples\n   - Still keep some distance from enemy snake\n3. Going LEFT would:\n   - Lead to (8, 7)\n   - Could then go up to get the apple at (8, 8)\n   - But puts me closer to enemy snake\n4.

This gives me options for next turn while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. From there, I can evaluate whether to move LEFT to get the apple at (8, 8) based on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nNext turn strategy: Watch enemy snake's movement and consider if it's safe to move LEFT for the apple at (8, 8).\n\nUP"

I'm now in a good position to potentially eat the apple at (8, 8) if the enemy snake doesn't block me.\n\nOptions:\n1. Move DOWN to (8, 8): This allows me to eat the apple at (8, 8) immediately. However, if the enemy snake moves LEFT, it will block me from the apple at (7, 8).\n\n2. Move LEFT to (7, 9): This keeps me safe from the enemy snake for now, but doesn't let me eat any apples yet. It could be a good stalling move if I think the enemy snake might move LEFT.\n\n3. Move RIGHT to (9, 9): This is not a valid move as it would make me hit the wall and die.\n\n4. Move UP to (8, 10): This is not a valid move as it would make me hit the wall and die.\n\nI think the best move is to go DOWN to (8, 8) and eat the apple there. This will make me grow and gain a point immediately. Even if the enemy snake moves LEFT and blocks the apple at (7, 8), I'll still be in a decent position. I'll need to be careful on the next turn to avoid getting trapped, but eating the apple now seems like the highest priority.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN and eating the apple, I'll need to watch the enemy snake carefully. If it moves UP or RIGHT, I should have some freedom to move LEFT and start heading towards the other apples. If it moves LEFT and blocks me, I may need to move RIGHT and loop around it. The key will be to avoid getting trapped while still trying to reach the remaining apples.\n\nDOWN"
