Minimize the movements considering apples at (6, 5), (7, 8), and the boundary optimism while securing self protection on move.\n2. **Enemy Proximity**:Always aware of enemy snake as he can encroach reverse paths.\n3. **Movement Paths**: Refer to all possible movements beside the critical apples basically it remains to play under secure safe away game.\n\n### Immediate Plan:\n1. The goal should be to move upward as soon as possible so maybe you can reach farthest on the board upward path say Y:1 allowing another one above you.\n2. Alternatively, minimize other method specificity and strategy as you need to keep minimal on fresh moves because apple may be too near on next opponent side.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven all the factors, let's start moving left to get closer to the next nearest apple, hence I will move UP for moment and then stay secure on next decision as it again yields best strategic moves where positional will change dynamically.\n\nNext Move: UP"
