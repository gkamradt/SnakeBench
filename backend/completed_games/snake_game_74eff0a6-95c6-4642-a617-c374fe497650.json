            "rationale": "Thinking out loud: My current position is (8, 9). My last move was RIGHT.  The apple at (8, 7) is directly in front of me.  Moving UP would put me at (8, 8).  That's closer to the apple and doesn't put me at risk of hitting a wall, another snake, or myself.  Enemy snake 1 is at (5, 6) with body at (5, 5), (4, 5).  I'm not in danger of hitting that snake.  I'm not in danger of hitting myself.  I'm not in danger of hitting a wall.  Moving UP is the best option to get closer to the apple at (8, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turn:  Prioritize apples. If there's an apple directly in front of me, go for it. If not, look for the closest apple. If no apples are directly accessible, move in a direction that doesn't put me at risk of hitting a wall, another snake, or myself.  If multiple directions are safe, prioritize the direction that gets me closer to an apple.  Also, be aware of the enemy snake at (5, 6) and its body at (5, 5), (4, 5).  Crucially, I need to remember my previous moves to avoid getting stuck in loops.  I should also start keeping track of the positions of the apples to predict their locations.  I should also start noting the positions of the enemy snake and its body.  I need to keep track of my own body position to avoid collisions.  If I'm close to an apple, I should prioritize that.  I should also start calculating distances to apples.  I need to remember my previous moves to avoid loops.  I should also calculate distances to apples and enemy snakes.  Crucially, I need to check for wall collisions before moving.  I should also calculate the Manhattan distance to apples.\n\nNext move: UP"
