Given their proximity, aiming for these apples should be a priority to gain points and grow.\n- Moving directly down (\"DOWN\") results in collecting the apple at (3, 8) immediately and positions me advantageously for the next apple at (4, 8).\n- Moving \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", or \"UP\" does not offer immediate benefits, as no apples are directly accessible from those directions and could potentially expose me to risks without reward.\n- Safety is a priority as colliding with walls or other obstacles results in immediate game over. With the only nearby enemy snake (snake #2) at (9, 7), there's no immediate threat of collision with another snake.\n- After moving \"DOWN\" this turn, on the subsequent move, planning to go \"RIGHT\" may allow me to collect the next apple at (4, 8).\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- Depending on the outcome after moving \"DOWN\", consider moving \"RIGHT\" to target the apple at (4, 8).\n- Keep a watch on the enemy snake\u2019s movements, especially if it moves towards the center where more apples are present.\n\nDecision:\n- I will move DOWN this turn to collect the apple at (3, 8)."
