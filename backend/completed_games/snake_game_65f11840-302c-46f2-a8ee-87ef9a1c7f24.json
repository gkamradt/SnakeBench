            "rationale": "Let's analyze the situation. I'm currently at (9, 4) and I have a few apples within reach. I see that the apple at (4, 8) is close to me, and I also have an apple at (0, 9) that I can reach if I move up.\n\nMy current position is in the middle of the board, and I have some space to move around. I don't see any immediate threats from other snakes.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to try to get closer to the apple at (4, 8) and see if I can eat it. If I can't reach it, I'll try to move up to the apple at (0, 9).\n\nSince I'm currently at (9, 4) and the apple at (4, 8) is to my right, I can move in that direction. However, I should also consider the snake at position (4, 8) with its body at (5, 8). If I move into its path, I'll die.\n\nTo avoid the snake, I can move up first and then try to move right. This way, I'll be above the snake's body and can safely move right to get closer to the apple.\n\nMy next move is: UP\n\nStrategy for the next turn: I'll try to move right and then see if I can eat the apple at (4, 8). If I can't reach it, I'll try to move up to the apple at (0, 9).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
