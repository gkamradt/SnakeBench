This approach maximizes the potential point gain and avoids any unnecessary risk.\n\n**Next Moves Planning:**\n\n- After collecting the apple at (3,4), evaluate potential directions based on the updated positions of other apples and potential threats (like enemy snake's movements).\n- Adapt to new positions of any additional apples that appear, and if possible, position the snake advantageously towards the upper half of the field where multiple apples are clustered.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\nRIGHT."

There are no immediate threats from enemy snakes in this direction.\n   - **Strategy:** Moving UP allows you to consume the apple at (7, 6), granting you 1 point and increasing your snake's length. This immediate gain can provide a strategic advantage, making your snake longer and potentially more resilient.\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Directly consumes an available apple.\n     - Enhances your snake's length, which can be beneficial for defending against threats and navigating the board.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Continual upward movement could limit future maneuverability near the board's top edge. However, with multiple apple locations spread across the board, this risk is mitigated in later moves.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** Moving DOWN would reverse the last move, potentially risking collision with your own body, especially as your snake grows longer.\n   - **Strategy:** This move takes you away from immediate point opportunities and could lead to restrictive movement patterns in future turns.\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Opens pathways toward the board's lower and central areas.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Increases the risk of self-collision.\n     - Moves away from the nearest apple.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (6, 5) is empty and safe.\n   - **Strategy:** Centralizing provides flexibility to navigate towards various apple locations.

While tails can sometimes be safe if they move away, it's risky as it might belong to an enemy snake.\n3. **LEFT to (6, 7):** This cell is empty and provides a direct path towards the apple at (6, 8).\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 7):** This cell is empty but doesn't lead towards any nearby apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Targeting Apples:** The closest apple is at (6, 8). Moving towards it will grant a point and potentially increase our length.\n- **Avoiding Hazards:** Staying away from enemy snake positions, especially Snake #1 at (2, 8) to avoid conflicts.\n- **Future Planning:** Positioning ourselves to access other apples while maintaining safe distances from enemy snakes.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (6, 7) positions the snake closer to the apple at (6, 8) while avoiding immediate hazards. This move balances both safety and the opportunity to gain points.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

Based on the provided board state, I just consumed the apple previously at (2, 7).\n\n**Immediate Options and Threats:**\n1. Nearby apple is at (1, 9). This apple would require moving UP and LEFT, potentially spanning across multiple turns.\n2. Enemy Snake #2 is further to the right at (6, 7), and poses no immediate threat due to the considerable distance between us.\n3. No immediate threats such as walls or my own body parts in the direct vicinity around my head.\n\n**Assessing Directional Choices:**\n1. Moving UP will lead towards the upper limit of the board, where the next closest apple at (1, 9) is located. It's safe as there are no obstructions directly above.\n2. Moving RIGHT or LEFT does not provide a direct benefit, especially since the only apple in range requires moving UP mainly.\n3. Moving DOWN is useless as it leads back to where I came from without any apparent benefit.\n\n**Strategy Going Forward:**\nGiven the above considerations, my strategy for the next few moves can be planned as follows:\n- First, move UP towards (2, 8) on the next move.\n- Then, move LEFT when approaching the top to head towards the apple at (1, 9).\n\n**Final Decision for Next Move:**\nTo gain access to the remaining apple at (1, 9), and considering no immediate threats, I will move **UP** this turn. This is a strategic choice combining safety and goal orientation towards gathering the next apple.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

This places Snake #1 away from the immediate vicinity of your snake, reducing the threat in your vicinity.\n\n**Possible Moves from (6, 7):**\n1. **UP to (6, 8):**\n   - **Pros:** \n     - Directly lands on an apple, granting you 1 point and increasing your length.\n     - Positions you closer to another apple at (6, 5), creating opportunities for future moves.\n     - No immediate threats or collisions in this direction.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - None apparent at this moment.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** \n     - Moves you away from the current position, potentially avoiding any unforeseen hazards.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - Does not provide immediate points.\n     - Takes you further from the nearest apple.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 7):**\n   - **Pros:** \n     - Keeps you in the central area with access to multiple paths.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - Does not lead to an immediate apple.\n     - Potentially increases the distance from the nearest apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n   - **Pros:** \n     - Reverses the previous move, but this might not be strategically advantageous.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - Risky as it heads back towards the previous position, potentially leading to self-collision if not managed carefully.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Immediate Gain:** Securing an apple provides not only points but also increases your snake's length, which can be advantageous for blocking enemy paths while avoiding self-collision.\n- **Future Planning:** Moving towards (6, 8) keeps you aligned with another apple at (6, 5), allowing for a clear path to continue collecting points.\n- **Safety:** The chosen path avoids enemy snakes and minimizes collision risks.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **UP** to (6, 8) is the most advantageous move.
