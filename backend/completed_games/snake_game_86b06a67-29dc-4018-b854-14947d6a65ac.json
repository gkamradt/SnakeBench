Continuing to move RIGHT could be beneficial in steering clear of danger zones while also bringing me closer to more apples along the higher x-axis, specifically those at (9, 5) and (9, 6). However, going RIGHT from my current position (1, 6) would position me at (2, 6), which is directly above the apple at (2, 5). \n\nConsidering my surroundings and the positions of other snakes, moving UP from there in the following turn would place me directly on the apple at (2, 5), promoting not only growth but also keeping my options open for further RIGHT movement toward the apples at (9, 5) and (9, 6). Apple collection should be prioritized to maximize points while maintaining a safe distance from other snakes and walls. \n\nDOWN and LEFT are not ideal in this scenario; DOWN would move me away from nearby apples, and LEFT would backtrack, increasing the chance of collision when the snake grows longer.\n\nStrategy for the next move:\nAfter moving RIGHT this turn to get to (2, 6), plan to move UP next to capture the apple at (2, 5). Depending on the movements of Snake #1 and the growth after eating the apple, future strategies may involve either proceeding right towards the additional apples at the rightmost of the board or reevaluating positions to safely capture other accessible apples.\n\nFinal decision for this move: RIGHT."

Since moving left or up is not beneficial (left would hit the boundary and up doesn't bring me closer to any apple), my primary options are moving down or right.\n\nConsidering the board state, moving down leads me into a row without immediate obstacles and potentially positions me to move right in future turns, closer to the apple at (2, 5). It will also keep me clear from running into enemy Snake #1 who is currently residing at (5, 7). Additionally, heading right directly doesn't offer an apple directly in line; however, it's more strategic to navigate towards the central part of the board.

This is the most straightforward move to increase my score without taking risks.\n\n3. **Observations**:\n   - After consuming the apple at (4, 9), my snake will grow, leading to a lengthier body that I must manage carefully to avoid running into myself.\n   - The apples at (9, 5) and (9, 6) present an opportunity to gain two points quickly since they are adjacent vertically.

Moving DOWN would keep me on a less conflicted path, though still a bit far from high-density apple areas.\n\nMoving LEFT would be impossible and fatal due to the boundary wall. Hence, the most strategic move now would be to start shifting to the RIGHT, which helps in eventually navigating towards the apple at (2, 5) without compromising my position or risking immediate collisions.\n\nStrategy for the next move:\nOnce moved RIGHT, my following turns would involve assessing the feasibility of moving UP towards the apple at (2, 5) or continuing RIGHT to either go directly for the apple at (9, 5), (9, 6) depending on further board developments, particularly the movements of Snake #1.\n\nFinal decision for this move: RIGHT."
