This move brings your snake closer to several available apples, enhances potential scoring opportunities, and maintains a safe distance from the enemy snake. Additionally, moving down keeps your options open for navigating towards the lower-left quadrant, where most apples are situated.\n\n**Next Move:** **DOWN**\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving down to (7, 6), aim to continue navigating towards the lower-left quadrant to collect apples at (7, 1) and (4, 2). Monitor the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions and maintain paths that allow for continued flexibility and safety."

There are no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. Later we can navigate toward the other apples in strategic order.\n\nThus, my next move is: LEFT."
