However, since I cannot move back to a previous position that I've just occupied, let's re-evaluate the board:\n\n### Current Board Situation\n- **Snake Position:** (4, 5)\n- **Apples:** (1, 1), (0, 1), (8, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n- **Enemy Snake:** (0, 8) with no body segments around it, providing a safe environment for me to explore further.\n\n### Possible Moves\nFrom (4, 5) I can make the following moves:\n1. **UP to (4, 6):** Valid but does not give me immediate access to the apples.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 4):** Moves me further away from apples, and I can't go backwards to (4, 5).\n3. **LEFT to (3, 5):** Valid move but still no access to any immediate apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 5):** This position has an apple, but I just identified that I can't move back there.\n\n### Apple Analysis\n- Immediately beneath me, (5, 4) is an apple I can access with my next move if I go DOWN first to (4, 4) and then back up. But I'm stuck because DOWN from (4, 5) would take me to (3, 5), which is still a poor choice for accessing apples.\n\n#### Strategic Focus\n- My main objective is to get to (5, 4) to consume the apple. \n- Given that I can't backtrack, my best immediate action now would then be to move in a way to position myself towards the future apple coordinates as I progress.\n\n### Decision\nTaking into account the requirement to move forward while aiming for the apples, I should go UP to (4, 6) since it keeps me safe from the enemy, and opens up potential moves in my upcoming turns.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: **UP**."

There are no immediate threats either.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5):** I cannot go back to my last position.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 6):** This is a valid move, but does not bring me closer to any apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 6):** This also keeps me on the same row and does not help with the apples.\n\n### Apple Location Focus:\nTo reevaluate my access to the apples, particularly the one at (5, 4), there is a path to it:\n- If I position myself to move down, I would have to check how to reach (5, 5) directly. Here\u2019s a clear route: \n    - Moving from (4, 6) to (5, 6).\n    - Then taking the next move DOWN to (5, 5) helps in eating the apple.\n\n### Strategy:\nAfter considering my possibilities, I actually might be better off going to the right first and positioning myself to access (5, 5) directly, because (5, 4) seems a bit farther given my current position.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (5, 6)**:\n- Then in my next turn, if I am still clear, I can move DOWN to (5, 5) for an apple.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering all the paths and future opportunities, moving RIGHT will serve me best.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: **RIGHT**."
