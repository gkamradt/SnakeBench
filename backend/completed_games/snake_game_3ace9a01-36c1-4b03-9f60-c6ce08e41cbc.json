There's an apple directly above me at (5, 4), which seems like the most straightforward and safe choice.\n2. The enemy snake at (5, 5) is just one square above the apple.\n3. No immediate risk of collision with walls or other snakes.\n\nStrategy Considerations:\n- Prioritize getting the closest apple safely\n- Avoid potential collision with enemy snake\n- Keep track of snake's body length and future movement possibilities\n\nReasoning for Move:\n- The apple at (5, 4) is the nearest and most accessible\n- Moving UP will get me the apple without risking collision\n- The enemy snake is right above the apple, but I can quickly grab the apple before potential interaction\n\nThinking for Next Turn:\n- After getting this apple, assess the board for the next closest apple\n- Be cautious of enemy snake's potential movements\n\nNext Move: UP"
