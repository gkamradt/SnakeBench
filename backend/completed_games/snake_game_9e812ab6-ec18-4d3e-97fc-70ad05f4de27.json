These are farther away and require multiple moves to reach.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Risks:**\n   - Moving UP to (6, 4) will allow me to immediately consume an apple, growing my length and scoring a point. This move does not pose any immediate risk since no other snakes or walls are in the immediate vicinity.\n   - The enemy snake is currently located at (2, 5), which is not in close proximity to my possible movements.\n   - Moving in any other direction (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) does not bring me closer to an apple and could delay my score increase.\n\n4. **Strategy Consideration:**\n   - Given the current board state, it's most beneficial to immediately collect the apple at (6, 4). This move maximizes my growth and point potential while maintaining safe control over the board.\n   - After moving UP and growing by one segment, I will need to reassess my position and plan subsequent moves, potentially moving towards another apple like (5, 7) or (9, 6).\n\n**Decided Move: UP**\n\nThis move will maximize point gain while avoiding risks.

No strategic benefit.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 5):**\n   - Moves away from the immediate goal of reaching the apple at (5, 7).\n   - Could potentially set up future plans to move toward other apples, but not beneficial in this context.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n   - A move toward the right doesn't align with the current apple target and would cause a deviation from the most direct path.\n\n### Strategic Recommendation:\nMaintaining the UP direction towards (5, 7) minimizes risk and continues toward an apple acquisition without entering any threat zones. This approach keeps a central position on the board, providing flexibility for subsequent moves after getting the apple.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- Continue to reassess the enemy snake's movement, ensuring that they do not change course toward me unexpectedly.\n- Prepare to evaluate the new position and proximity to other apples once the (5, 7) apple is secured.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nUP"

It's a direct and optimal route with no obstacles or threats.\n   - **Cons:** There are no immediate downsides to this move.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 5):**\n   - **Pros:** None.\n   - **Cons:** This move would mean backtracking away from the apple. It's unnecessary and counterproductive if the apple is the target.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Slight deviation that could eventually lead to the path of another apple after securing the closest one.\n   - **Cons:** Moving left takes me away from the apple and gets closer to the enemy snake, which could potentially lead to an unfavorable encounter.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Keeps me away from immediate enemy snake positions.\n   - **Cons:** This move also takes me away from the closest apple and does not serve the immediate goal of acquiring it.\n\n### Strategic Recommendation:\nMoving UP to (5, 7) is the most strategic as it leads directly to the apple. Post-acquisition, this position allows subsequent moves towards nearby apples at (9, 7) and (8, 8), given that the path remains clear of enemy threats.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- **Post-Acquisition:** After grabbing the apple, reassess enemy snake movement and proximity to the next target apple.\n- **Flexibility:** Stay adaptable to potential changes in enemy snake behavior or an opening towards new apples.\n- **Awareness:** Monitor the board for any emerging threats or obstacles.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nUP"
