Prioritize apples that are less contested and ensure not to trap ourselves or end up in positions where the enemy might block our path.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **LEFT**"

The enemy snake #1 is at (9,9), so I need to be careful about moving up as they might move down.\n\n4. Strategy analysis:\n- Moving UP to (8,9) would get me an apple immediately, but puts me close to enemy snake\n- Moving LEFT starts me on a path to the cluster of apples below\n- Moving DOWN starts me toward the lower apples\n- Moving RIGHT would put me against the wall\n\nBest immediate move is UP to get the apple at (8,9), but I need to be ready to move LEFT quickly next turn to avoid potential collision with snake #1.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After getting the apple at (8,9), plan to move LEFT to avoid enemy snake and start heading toward the cluster of apples in the lower portion of the board.\n\nUP"
