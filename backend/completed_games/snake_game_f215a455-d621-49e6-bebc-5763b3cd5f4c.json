They are not in an immediate threatening position as they are far.\n\n### Future Move Considerations\nGiven that I currently do not have any adjacent apples to consume from (5, 8), I need to consider available moves to keep growing:\n1.

However, since moving down means going back to my last position with no further growth, I\u2019ll have to rethink the strategy.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward\nFocus must shift toward finding a route towards remaining apples:\n-  The apples that are still available are at positions (4, 0), (2, 7), (1, 5), (2, 2).\n- Next turns should look for ways to reposition towards those apples while keeping an eye on the enemy snake to not trap myself.\n\n### Next Move Decision\nAfter careful consideration, I will move **DOWN** to (5, 7). \n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"
