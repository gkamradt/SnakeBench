This now necessitates re-evaluation for the next most feasible target.\n- Given the relative positions of other apples and the lack of immediate threats from the enemy snake #2, calculating my next moves will be crucial.\n\n**Immediate Environment:**\n- Upwards (UP) would lead towards the upper boundary but also towards two apples respectively at (6, 8) and (7, 9).
