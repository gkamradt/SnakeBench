Safety Check:\n   - Moving DOWN is safe as I'm not hitting a wall\n   - No immediate self-collision risk\n   - Enemy snake is close but not blocking my path directly\n\n4. Goal Prioritization:\n   - Collect apples\n   - Maintain strategic positioning\n   - Avoid enemy snake\n   - The (6, 2) apple looks like a good immediate target\n\n5. Potential Next Turn Strategy:\n   - After reaching (6, 2), reassess apple positions\n   - Keep track of enemy snake's movements\n   - Stay flexible in routing\n\nNext turn strategy reminder: Maintain board awareness, prioritize safe apple collection.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
