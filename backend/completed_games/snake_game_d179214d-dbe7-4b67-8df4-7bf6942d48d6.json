This will allow me to collect the apple at (8, 7) and potentially the one at (9, 8) if I can navigate around the enemy snake.\n\nMoving up also puts me in a better position to avoid the walls and the enemy snake, as the enemy snake is currently near the top of the board. By continuing upwards, I can potentially outmaneuver the enemy and reach more apples.\n\nFor my strategy next turn, I will focus on reaching the apple at (9, 8) while avoiding the enemy snake. If I can successfully navigate around the enemy and collect that apple, it will give me a significant advantage in points.\n\nMy next move will be: UP.\n\nUP."

The closest apples to our current position are now at (9, 8), (8, 2), (9, 0), (6, 0), and (0, 0). \n\nSince we have moved right, our priority should be to continue moving towards the apple at (9, 8), which is directly to the right of our current position. This move would bring us closer to the apple and potentially allow us to collect it in the next turn.\n\nWe should also keep an eye on the enemy snake #1, which is at position (7, 7) with its body at (7, 6). The enemy snake is not an immediate threat, but we should be prepared to change direction if it moves towards us.\n\nConsidering the current positions and the potential risks, our best move would be to continue moving right, as it allows us to move towards the apple at (9, 8) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving right, we should reassess the board and consider moving towards other apples, while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement and the positions of other apples. We should also be prepared to change direction if the enemy snake moves towards us or if we reach the apple at (9, 8).\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
