Moving up would take us closer to the apple at (7, 7) and away from the enemy snake, which is a good strategy.\n\nHowever, we should also consider the other apples and the overall board layout. The apple at (7, 1) is also a viable target, but it's further away and moving towards it would bring us closer to the enemy snake. The apple at (8, 4) is also an option, but it's not as close as the one at (7, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move up to (7, 9) to start heading towards the apple at (7, 7) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake and keeping options open for future moves.\n\nNext move: UP"
