It is certainly further away compared to others.\n   - (7, 6): Closer, just moving up and right from (5, 4). This appears to be a more viable option to pursue next.\n   - (9, 5): Located at the rightmost side, on the last row, but would require navigating mainly right and then down.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - Enemy snake #2 is at (4, 8). They are distanced from my position, but I shouldn't disregard their potential movements. I need to ensure I keep a safe distance from their potential surrounding.\n\n3. **Next Possible Moves from (5, 4)**:\n   - **UP (to 5, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, providing no new advantage.\n   - **DOWN (to 5, 3)**: This space is clear, but it does not lead to any immediate apple and takes me further from current apple proximity.\n   - **LEFT (to 4, 4)**: This would not yield any immediate benefits as it is backtracking; avoid it.\n   - **RIGHT (to 6, 4)**: This remains an open space. Moving this way does not directly progress towards an apple just yet.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the criteria above, my best path to pursue next would be to move towards (7, 6) by first going **UP to (5, 5)**. This would maintain my ability to choose between moves down to (5, 3) or continue right to (6, 4) in subsequent turns while keeping options open without approaching the enemy snake's territory. \n\nConsidering that (7, 6) involves moving up primarily and is the closer apple, I will favor keeping the options of potential future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nIn essence, my strategy is to keep moving towards closer apples while avoiding risks posed by the enemy snake. I want to ensure that each move leverages distance to the nearest apple available while retaining flexibility in case the enemy snake enters the fray.\n\nFinal decision for my next move: **UP**."

It is certainly further away compared to others.\n   - (7, 6): Closer, just moving up and right from (5, 4). This appears to be a more viable option to pursue next.\n   - (9, 5): Located at the rightmost side, on the last row, but would require navigating mainly right and then down.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - Enemy snake #2 is at (4, 8). They are distanced from my position, but I shouldn't disregard their potential movements. I need to ensure I keep a safe distance from their potential surrounding.\n\n3. **Next Possible Moves from (5, 4)**:\n   - **UP (to 5, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, providing no new advantage.\n   - **DOWN (to 5, 3)**: This space is clear, but it does not lead to any immediate apple and takes me further from current apple proximity.\n   - **LEFT (to 4, 4)**: This would not yield any immediate benefits as it is backtracking; avoid it.\n   - **RIGHT (to 6, 4)**: This remains an open space. Moving this way does not directly progress towards an apple just yet.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the criteria above, my best path to pursue next would be to move towards (7, 6) by first going **UP to (5, 5)**. This would maintain my ability to choose between moves down to (5, 3) or continue right to (6, 4) in subsequent turns while keeping options open without approaching the enemy snake's territory. \n\nConsidering that (7, 6) involves moving up primarily and is the closer apple, I will favor keeping the options of potential future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nIn essence, my strategy is to keep moving towards closer apples while avoiding risks posed by the enemy snake. I want to ensure that each move leverages distance to the nearest apple available while retaining flexibility in case the enemy snake enters the fray.\n\nFinal decision for my next move: **UP**."

It is certainly further away compared to others.\n   - (7, 6): Closer, just moving up and right from (5, 4). This appears to be a more viable option to pursue next.\n   - (9, 5): Located at the rightmost side, on the last row, but would require navigating mainly right and then down.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - Enemy snake #2 is at (4, 8). They are distanced from my position, but I shouldn't disregard their potential movements. I need to ensure I keep a safe distance from their potential surrounding.\n\n3. **Next Possible Moves from (5, 4)**:\n   - **UP (to 5, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, providing no new advantage.\n   - **DOWN (to 5, 3)**: This space is clear, but it does not lead to any immediate apple and takes me further from current apple proximity.\n   - **LEFT (to 4, 4)**: This would not yield any immediate benefits as it is backtracking; avoid it.\n   - **RIGHT (to 6, 4)**: This remains an open space. Moving this way does not directly progress towards an apple just yet.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the criteria above, my best path to pursue next would be to move towards (7, 6) by first going **UP to (5, 5)**. This would maintain my ability to choose between moves down to (5, 3) or continue right to (6, 4) in subsequent turns while keeping options open without approaching the enemy snake's territory. \n\nConsidering that (7, 6) involves moving up primarily and is the closer apple, I will favor keeping the options of potential future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nIn essence, my strategy is to keep moving towards closer apples while avoiding risks posed by the enemy snake.

It is certainly further away compared to others.\n   - (7, 6): Closer, just moving up and right from (5, 4). This appears to be a more viable option to pursue next.\n   - (9, 5): Located at the rightmost side, on the last row, but would require navigating mainly right and then down.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - Enemy snake #2 is at (4, 8). They are distanced from my position, but I shouldn't disregard their potential movements. I need to ensure I keep a safe distance from their potential surrounding.\n\n3. **Next Possible Moves from (5, 4)**:\n   - **UP (to 5, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, providing no new advantage.\n   - **DOWN (to 5, 3)**: This space is clear, but it does not lead to any immediate apple and takes me further from current apple proximity.\n   - **LEFT (to 4, 4)**: This would not yield any immediate benefits as it is backtracking; avoid it.\n   - **RIGHT (to 6, 4)**: This remains an open space. Moving this way does not directly progress towards an apple just yet.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the criteria above, my best path to pursue next would be to move towards (7, 6) by first going **UP to (5, 5)**. This would maintain my ability to choose between moves down to (5, 3) or continue right to (6, 4) in subsequent turns while keeping options open without approaching the enemy snake's territory. \n\nConsidering that (7, 6) involves moving up primarily and is the closer apple, I will favor keeping the options of potential future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nIn essence, my strategy is to keep moving towards closer apples while avoiding risks posed by the enemy snake. I want to ensure that each move leverages distance to the nearest apple available while retaining flexibility in case the enemy snake enters the fray.\n\nFinal decision for my next move: **UP**."

If I move UP, I'm more likely to be blocked and potentially caught.\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 5)**: Moving down would take me away from the apples and doesn't contribute towards my goal.\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 6)**: This is a backtracking move to my prior position and will gain me nothing.\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 6)**: This move directly leads me to the apple and is the most strategic choice since it will allow me to gain points.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering the potential moves, moving RIGHT towards (7, 6) is the optimal choice since it allows me to collect the apple immediately, grow my snake, and increase my score. The enemy snake above me complicates things, but accessing the apple first takes precedence.\n\n### Strategy\nAs I continue the game, I'll need to stay wary of the enemy snake's position while trying to access the apples.

Moving DOWN to (7, 5) not only avoids immediate confrontation but also allows me an exit route to explore other apples further down. This provides flexibility and keeps my options open for the next turns.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward\nAfter making this downward move, I will keep a close watch on the enemy snake's movements. I should also position myself safely to gather more apples located at (2, 3), (3, 0), and (9, 5) as the game progresses.

Moving this way does not directly progress towards an apple just yet.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the criteria above, my best path to pursue next would be to move towards (7, 6) by first going **UP to (5, 5)**. This would maintain my ability to choose between moves down to (5, 3) or continue right to (6, 4) in subsequent turns while keeping options open without approaching the enemy snake's territory. \n\nConsidering that (7, 6) involves moving up primarily and is the closer apple, I will favor keeping the options of potential future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nIn essence, my strategy is to keep moving towards closer apples while avoiding risks posed by the enemy snake. I want to ensure that each move leverages distance to the nearest apple available while retaining flexibility in case the enemy snake enters the fray.\n\nFinal decision for my next move: **UP**."

Moving DOWN to (7, 5) not only avoids immediate confrontation but also allows me an exit route to explore other apples further down. This provides flexibility and keeps my options open for the next turns.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward\nAfter making this downward move, I will keep a close watch on the enemy snake's movements.

It is certainly further away compared to others.\n   - (7, 6): Closer, just moving up and right from (5, 4). This appears to be a more viable option to pursue next.\n   - (9, 5): Located at the rightmost side, on the last row, but would require navigating mainly right and then down.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - Enemy snake #2 is at (4, 8). They are distanced from my position, but I shouldn't disregard their potential movements. I need to ensure I keep a safe distance from their potential surrounding.\n\n3. **Next Possible Moves from (5, 4)**:\n   - **UP (to 5, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, providing no new advantage.\n   - **DOWN (to 5, 3)**: This space is clear, but it does not lead to any immediate apple and takes me further from current apple proximity.\n   - **LEFT (to 4, 4)**: This would not yield any immediate benefits as it is backtracking; avoid it.\n   - **RIGHT (to 6, 4)**: This remains an open space. Moving this way does not directly progress towards an apple just yet.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the criteria above, my best path to pursue next would be to move towards (7, 6) by first going **UP to (5, 5)**. This would maintain my ability to choose between moves down to (5, 3) or continue right to (6, 4) in subsequent turns while keeping options open without approaching the enemy snake's territory. \n\nConsidering that (7, 6) involves moving up primarily and is the closer apple, I will favor keeping the options of potential future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nIn essence, my strategy is to keep moving towards closer apples while avoiding risks posed by the enemy snake. I want to ensure that each move leverages distance to the nearest apple available while retaining flexibility in case the enemy snake enters the fray.\n\nFinal decision for my next move: **UP**."

It is certainly further away compared to others.\n   - (7, 6): Closer, just moving up and right from (5, 4). This appears to be a more viable option to pursue next.\n   - (9, 5): Located at the rightmost side, on the last row, but would require navigating mainly right and then down.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - Enemy snake #2 is at (4, 8). They are distanced from my position, but I shouldn't disregard their potential movements. I need to ensure I keep a safe distance from their potential surrounding.\n\n3. **Next Possible Moves from (5, 4)**:\n   - **UP (to 5, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, providing no new advantage.\n   - **DOWN (to 5, 3)**: This space is clear, but it does not lead to any immediate apple and takes me further from current apple proximity.\n   - **LEFT (to 4, 4)**: This would not yield any immediate benefits as it is backtracking; avoid it.\n   - **RIGHT (to 6, 4)**: This remains an open space. Moving this way does not directly progress towards an apple just yet.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the criteria above, my best path to pursue next would be to move towards (7, 6) by first going **UP to (5, 5)**. This would maintain my ability to choose between moves down to (5, 3) or continue right to (6, 4) in subsequent turns while keeping options open without approaching the enemy snake's territory. \n\nConsidering that (7, 6) involves moving up primarily and is the closer apple, I will favor keeping the options of potential future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nIn essence, my strategy is to keep moving towards closer apples while avoiding risks posed by the enemy snake.

It is certainly further away compared to others.\n   - (7, 6): Closer, just moving up and right from (5, 4).

They are distanced from my position, but I shouldn't disregard their potential movements. I need to ensure I keep a safe distance from their potential surrounding.\n\n3. **Next Possible Moves from (5, 4)**:\n   - **UP (to 5, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, providing no new advantage.\n   - **DOWN (to 5, 3)**: This space is clear, but it does not lead to any immediate apple and takes me further from current apple proximity.\n   - **LEFT (to 4, 4)**: This would not yield any immediate benefits as it is backtracking; avoid it.\n   - **RIGHT (to 6, 4)**: This remains an open space.
