            "rationale": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. Current position: (0, 9)\n2. Body: Based on last move LEFT, my tail is at (1, 9)\n3. Nearest apples:\n   * (3, 8) - reachable by going DOWN and then RIGHT\n   * (3, 5) and (4, 5) - mid-board cluster\n   * (1, 1) - bottom left area\n   * (9, 2) - far right bottom\n\n4. Enemy snake is at (5, 0) with body at (4, 0), still far away and not a threat\n\nStrategy:\n1. I can't go RIGHT (would hit my body)\n2. Going UP would hit the wall\n3. Going LEFT would hit the wall\n4. The best move is DOWN to start moving towards the apple at (3, 8)\n\nThis DOWN move will:\n1. Keep me safe from walls and my own body\n2. Start positioning me towards the apple at (3, 8)\n3. Give me flexibility for next moves\n\nNext turn strategy:\nAfter moving DOWN, I can plan to move RIGHT to approach the apple at (3, 8). I'll need to be careful about my growing tail and make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nI choose: DOWN"
