I'll move up (DOWN would take me off the board), left (X < 0 is out of bounds), and right (X > 9 is out of bounds).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. Moving up would bring me closer to the apple at (6, 1), but it's risky because I'd be moving towards snake #1. Moving right would bring me closer to the apples at (4, 8) and (1, 5), but it's risky because I'd be moving towards the edge of the board. Moving left would bring me closer to the apples at (3, 6) and (4, 6), but it's less risky since I'm already near the edge of the board and there are no other snakes nearby.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to avoid moving towards the edge of the board as much as possible to minimize the risk of falling off.\n\nNext move: LEFT. I'll move left to position (0, 2). This move brings me closer to the apples at (3, 6) and (4, 6), and it's less risky since I'm already near the edge of the board and there are no other snakes nearby."
