The apple at (6,8) is two steps up and two steps left.\n\nThe apple at (3,6) is to my left, and is on the same Y coordinate.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is far away, and the apple at (1,9) is also far.\n\nI should probably try to get the apple at (6,8) or (3,6). Going to (3,6) is safer, as I won't be near the edge.\n\nNext turn, I will try to head towards the (1,9) apple, but for now, I will go left.\n\nLEFT"
