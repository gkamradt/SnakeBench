I'm still trying to get to the apple at (5, 2), but I need to be careful not to run into the wall or the enemy snake.\n\nI'll take a look at the board state again... Ah, I see that the enemy snake is still at (3, 5) with its body at [(2, 5), (2, 6)]. It's not directly in my path to the apple at (5, 2), but I should still keep an eye on it.\n\nMy current strategy is to move towards the apple at (5, 2) while avoiding the enemy snake and the wall. Since I'm already at the top row, moving UP would put me at risk of running into the wall. Instead, I think I should move LEFT again to get closer to the apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll continue to move towards the apple at (5, 2) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I'll need to adjust my path accordingly.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

This increases the snake's length by one unit.\n- The immediate next step is to decide which apple to target next from the available options.\n\n**Optional Targets:**\n\n1. Apple at (1, 0): This requires moving left and down. The path appears clear, but moving too close to the bottom-left corner may constrain future moves.\n2. Apple at (2, 4): This apple is directly accessible through an unobstructed path upward, but it requires a vertical move.\n\n3. Apple at (0, 6): The path involves several moves and could bring the snake close to the board's edge on the left.\n4. Apple at (7, 0) and (8, 4): These apples are to the right and might be longer paths to reach, but involve fewer tight maneuvers.\n\n**Threats Evaluation:**\n\n- Snake #2 is at position (5, 6) with its body at [(6, 6), (6, 7)]. While it is not an immediate threat, avoid approaching too closely to reduce the risk of collision.\n- There are no imminent walls or self-collision risks in the current position.\n\n**Strategic Objective:**\n\n- Target the apple at (2, 4) next since it is straightforwardly accessible from the current position and navigate vertically to minimize complexity.\n- Prepare for directional changes in case Snake #2 moves unpredictably, especially if it moves downward or toward the path of potential future targets.\n\n**Evaluation for Next Move:**\n\n- Moving UP will start the path toward the apple at (2, 4). This action remains low-risk as it does not directly intersect with other snakes or hazards.\n\n**Strategy for Future Turns:**\n\n- After capturing the apple at (2, 4), reassess the accessibility of the nearest apple, potentially switching to the apple at (1, 0) or (0, 6) based on the current state.\n- Continue monitoring the positions and body segments of Snake #2 to remain adaptable to changing threats.\n- Be aware of the snake's increased length and adjust sharp turn strategies as necessary to prevent self-collision.\n\nDecided Next Move: UP"
