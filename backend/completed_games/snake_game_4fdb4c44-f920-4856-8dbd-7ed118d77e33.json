Since I'm currently at (1, 1), I can move up (to position (1, 0)), down (to position (1, 2)), left (to position (0, 1)), or right (to position (2, 1)).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. There are three apples in the vicinity: (6, 7), (5, 3), and (4, 3). If I move up, I won't reach any of these apples. If I move down, I might be able to reach the apple at (4, 3), but there's a risk of colliding with snake #2. If I move left, I might be able to reach the apple at (5, 3), but it's further away than the apple at (4, 3). If I move right, I won't reach any of the nearby apples.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll move down (to position (1, 2)) to try to reach the apple at (4, 3) while avoiding snake #2.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I don't collide with snake #2 or the wall, I'll move towards the apple I'm closest to.
