However, moving directly left would put me in a position where I might be vulnerable to the enemy snake, which is currently at (6, 1) and has a body extending to (8, 0).\n\nTo avoid immediate danger and to position myself better for the next move, I should move left to (4, 9). This move will allow me to avoid the enemy snake and give me a better angle to approach the apple at (0, 7) in the future.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving left to (4, 9), I will reassess the board to determine the best path to the apple at (0, 7), while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements and ensuring I don't get cornered.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
