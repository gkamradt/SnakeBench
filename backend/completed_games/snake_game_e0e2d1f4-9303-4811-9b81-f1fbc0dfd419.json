That\u2019s safe, but it moves us away from the apples currently in column 8 (namely at (8,3) and (8,1)). It also gets us closer to the enemy snake #2\u2019s head at (8,9) \u2013 something to avoid whenever possible.\n\n\u2022 LEFT would land us at (7,6), which is safe. However, that takes us off the apple column and would require additional lateral moves later. Staying in the same column where we have multiple apple targets feels more efficient.\n\n\u2022 DOWN moves us to (8,5), keeping us on column 8 and setting us directly on course for the apple at (8,3), which is only a couple of moves away. The board below is clear, and this path minimizes distance to the next apple while avoiding the enemy\u2019s vicinity.\n\nGiven these considerations, our best move is DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

However, I'm not sure if I can make it there without running into the wall or another snake. I'll need to take a closer look at the board and plan my move carefully.\n\nI notice that Snake #1 is at position (8, 5) with a body length of 1, which is relatively close to me. I'll need to avoid running into it, so I'll try to move in a direction that will keep me away from it.\n\nAfter considering my options, I think I'll move... RIGHT. This will allow me to stay away from Snake #1 and potentially get closer to one of the apples.\n\nNext turn strategy: I'll try to get a better sense of the board and plan my next move based on the positions of the apples and the other snakes.\n\nMy decided next move is: RIGHT."

Staying on column 8 is efficient.\n\u2022 Moving UP is not safe because (8,6) is occupied by our own body.\n\u2022 Moving LEFT takes us off of column 8 and away from our target apples.\n\u2022 Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is possible but doesn\u2019t provide as direct a route as staying in column 8.\n\nThus, heading DOWN from (8,5) takes us to (8,4), keeping us on course for the apple at (8,3) while avoiding any collisions with our own body or enemy snakes.\n\nStrategy note for subsequent turns: Continue evaluating moves so you maintain access to the apples along column 8, while being ready to adjust should enemy snakes or wall boundaries come into play.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
