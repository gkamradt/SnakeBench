Maintains open space for future moves.\n\n- **DOWN to (7, 6):**\n  - **Safety:** This position contains an apple and is free from enemy snakes.\n  - **Benefit:** Moving down allows me to collect the apple at **(7, 6)**, gaining 1 point and increasing my length. This not only boosts my score but also provides more presence on the board for future moves.\n\n- **LEFT to (6, 7):**\n  - **Safety:** This is the current position of my tail ('T'). Moving left is safe as the tail will move forward.\n  - **Benefit:** While safe, moving left does not provide any immediate advantage in terms of apple collection and may limit access to nearby apples.\n\n- **RIGHT to (8, 7):**\n  - **Safety:** The position is empty and within the board limits.\n  - **Benefit:** Moving right does not bring me closer to any immediate objectives and takes me further away from the available apples.\n\n**Safety Considerations:**\n- **Enemy Snake Position:** The enemy snake is at **(8, 3)**, posing no immediate threat to any of the potential moves.\n- **Board Boundaries:** All potential moves are within the board limits, eliminating the risk of running into a wall.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Apple Collection:** The apple at **(7, 6)** is within reach by moving down. Collecting it will enhance my score and provide additional length, which is advantageous for controlling more of the board.\n- **Future Moves:** After collecting the apple, I can plan to target other nearby apples such as **(6, 2)** or **(4, 3)** while ensuring I maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided Move:** **DOWN**"
