(3,2) is one step closer vertically; however, pursuing (6,2) by going RIGHT offers a more balanced approach. There are no nearby threats from the enemy snake at (6,6), and our own body is safely out of the way.\n\nThus my strategy is to move RIGHT immediately, which brings me closer to apple (6,2). In coming turns, I'll continue working my way toward that apple while monitoring both the board\u2019s overall layout and the enemy snake\u2019s movements.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

This position keeps me engaged in the game, maintains the potential to head toward the cluster of apples further down the line, and allows me to assess my options for future moves without running into my own body or the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\nFrom (8, 2), I can employ further analysis of the remaining apples and reassess the potential risks of approaching the enemy snake while keeping avenues open for growth.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\n**DOWN** to (8, 2)."

In contrast, moving LEFT to (8, 4) might not only free up space in my current row but begin the journey toward the left side where many apples are located.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\nAfter this move, if I go LEFT to (8, 4), I should focus on assessing my surroundings again and plot a course that enables me to navigate toward the left side of the board\u2014where the apples are located.

In contrast, moving LEFT to (8, 4) might not only free up space in my current row but begin the journey toward the left side where many apples are located.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\nAfter this move, if I go LEFT to (8, 4), I should focus on assessing my surroundings again and plot a course that enables me to navigate toward the left side of the board\u2014where the apples are located.

It keeps me on track toward the target apple while maintaining distance from the enemy snake. After that, my next move can be UP and then again LEFT toward (4, 5) without any obstructions.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- Focus on moving left towards (5, 6), to gradually approach the apple at (4, 5) in the upcoming turns.\n- Monitor enemy positions to avoid collision.\n- Keep the end goal in mind: reaching the apples efficiently while navigating around potential dangers.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

Reviewing the board state, I note that I have three potential apples still on the board: (3, 9), (1, 7), and (6, 2). However, the immediate threat is the enemy snake located at (6, 2) which occupies the spaces (6, 2), (6, 3), and (5, 3).\n\n### Possible Moves from (8, 3):\n1. **UP to (8, 4)**: \n   - The position is open but contains no apples. This would be a safe move but doesn\u2019t advance my point opportunity.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 2)**: \n   - This position is empty and also doesn't conflict with any obstacles. However, it does not move me closer to any apples.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 3)**: \n   - This position is occupied by my own body, so I cannot move here.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 3)**: \n   - This position is also empty (and outside of the apple range), so it's a safe move but not strategically beneficial.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **Moving UP to (8, 4)** continues exploring the unknown area but could potentially block pathways in future moves.\n- **Moving DOWN to (8, 2)** does not present immediate threats or benefits but keeps my options for future moves open.\n- **Moving RIGHT to (9, 3)** is a safe option but takes me toward the edge of the board without any potential gain.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I will avoid moving into spaces with no strategic value; thus, the best move would logically be **DOWN to (8, 2)**. This position keeps me engaged in the game, maintains the potential to head toward the cluster of apples further down the line, and allows me to assess my options for future moves without running into my own body or the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\nFrom (8, 2), I can employ further analysis of the remaining apples and reassess the potential risks of approaching the enemy snake while keeping avenues open for growth.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\n**DOWN** to (8, 2)."

Our own body is not in the way because as we move, our tail will retract (unless we eat an apple).\n\n\u2022 Moving RIGHT to (2,3) doesn't progress much toward our target and doesn\u2019t bring us closer to any apple immediately.\n\n\u2022 Moving LEFT to (0,3) similarly doesn\u2019t contribute toward our apple goal, and moving DOWN is not an option because that would run into our own body at (1,2).\n\nConsidering these options, moving UP keeps our head aligned with the apple at (1,7). It also keeps us away from walls and enemy snake (located farther away at (6,8)).\n\nI\u2019ll continue pursuing the apple at (1,7) by moving UP.\n\nNext move: UP."

The apples are at (9, 4), (9, 6), (6, 9), and (5, 2).\n\n### Move Evaluation:\nGiven my position, I need to evaluate potential move options while considering the apples and my body constraints:\n\n1. **UP to (6, 8)**: This space is empty. This is a valid move.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 6)**: This space is empty. This is a valid move.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 7)**: This space contains my body. Not valid.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: This space is empty. This is a valid move.\n\n### Next Move Considerations:\n- **UP to (6, 8)**: Moving up opens options to move further up towards (6,9) next turn, which contains an apple but keeps me in a vertical column with less horizontal maneuverability.\n- **DOWN to (6, 6)**: This keeps me on the current x-axis but does not progress towards an apple.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: This might keep more horizontal movement options available next turn but doesn't directly progress towards the nearest apples.\n\n### Strategic Goals:\n- I should prioritize moving towards (6, 9) to secure that apple. Moving UP to (6, 8) allows me to move directly to (6, 9) on my next turn, which is a good strategic move.\n- I need to avoid running into enemy snake #1 while also keeping my body segments in mind.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the breakdown of each possible move, moving UP to (6, 8) places me one step closer to securing a point from the apple at (6, 9). \n\nDecided next move: UP."

Moving here is very advantageous as it gives me another point and also an opportunity to grow.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7)**: This space contains my body. Not a valid move.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8)**: This space is empty and valid, but does not progress towards the apple.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8)**: This space is empty and valid as well, but again does not advance towards the apple at (6, 9).\n\n### Next Move Considerations:\n- **UP to (6, 9)**: This is definitely the best move since it allows me to collect an apple and grow in size, increasing my score.\n- **DOWN and LEFT**: Not possible.\n- **RIGHT**: While it\u2019s a valid move, it does not help in accessing the nearby apple and keeps me further away.\n\n### Strategic Goals:\nI should prioritize acquiring the apple at (6, 9) since it is directly above my current position.
