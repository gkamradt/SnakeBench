The apple at (2, 4) is relatively near if moving up, while the apple at (3, 2) is accessible if moving down.\n- **Enemy Position:** The enemy snake is positioned towards the left side of the board. Moving closer to its area increases the risk of future blockages or conflicts.\n- **Future Movement Flexibility:** Maintaining a central position is crucial to adapt to the game's progression and avoid getting trapped. Moving right preserves more pathways for future turns.\n- **Avoiding Traps:** Ensuring that each move keeps multiple pathways open is essential for longevity in the game. Avoid moving towards areas that could lead to dead-ends or limited escape routes.\n\n**Strategy for Subsequent Turns:**\n- **Collect Nearby Apples:** Focus on acquiring apples that are within close proximity to maximize score efficiently.\n- **Monitor Enemy Movements:** Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to anticipate and avoid potential blockages or conflicts.\n- **Optimize Pathways:** Ensure that each move maintains access to various parts of the board, reducing the risk of getting cornered.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **RIGHT**"

Moving closer to its area increases the risk of future blockages or conflicts.\n- **Future Movement Flexibility:** Maintaining a central position is crucial to adapt to the game's progression and avoid getting trapped. Moving right preserves more pathways for future turns.\n- **Avoiding Traps:** Ensuring that each move keeps multiple pathways open is essential for longevity in the game. Avoid moving towards areas that could lead to dead-ends or limited escape routes.\n\n**Strategy for Subsequent Turns:**\n- **Collect Nearby Apples:** Focus on acquiring apples that are within close proximity to maximize score efficiently.\n- **Monitor Enemy Movements:** Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to anticipate and avoid potential blockages or conflicts.\n- **Optimize Pathways:** Ensure that each move maintains access to various parts of the board, reducing the risk of getting cornered.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **RIGHT**"

The apple at (2, 4) is relatively near if moving up, while the apple at (3, 2) is accessible if moving down.\n- **Enemy Position:** The enemy snake is positioned towards the left side of the board. Moving closer to its area increases the risk of future blockages or conflicts.\n- **Future Movement Flexibility:** Maintaining a central position is crucial to adapt to the game's progression and avoid getting trapped. Moving right preserves more pathways for future turns.\n- **Avoiding Traps:** Ensuring that each move keeps multiple pathways open is essential for longevity in the game. Avoid moving towards areas that could lead to dead-ends or limited escape routes.\n\n**Strategy for Subsequent Turns:**\n- **Collect Nearby Apples:** Focus on acquiring apples that are within close proximity to maximize score efficiently.\n- **Monitor Enemy Movements:** Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to anticipate and avoid potential blockages or conflicts.\n- **Optimize Pathways:** Ensure that each move maintains access to various parts of the board, reducing the risk of getting cornered.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **RIGHT**"

This move aligns with the primary objective of collecting the nearby apple at **(9, 0)**. Additionally, it minimizes the risk of self-collision and keeps you clear of enemy snake paths, ensuring safer navigation in subsequent turns.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns:**\n\n- **Objective:** Continue moving downward towards the apple at **(9, 0)**.\n- **Safety:** Maintain awareness of enemy snake movements to avoid potential collisions.\n- **Post-Apple Collection:** After collecting the apple, reassess the board to determine the next best direction based on remaining apples and enemy positions.\n- **Flexibility:** Ensure a clear path to maximize point gains while minimizing risks, possibly circling back or exploring less crowded areas once initial apples are collected.\n\n---\n\n**Next Move:**  \n**DOWN**"
