It might be safer to avoid confrontation where possible.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down immediately puts you on an apple, granting you points and increasing your length. This move is attractive and directly contributes to achieving the goal.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left means escaping the current apple, but it keeps you from potentially gaining more points and adds more risk since you're also reducing the distance towards the more active part of the board.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right puts you off the board, a guaranteed lose condition. We should avoid this option.\n\nAs the goal is to maximize points and you have an immediate opportunity to gain points by moving to the apple below you, the optimal choice is **DOWN**. Additionally, this move will cause our enemy to reconsider their path due to our increased body length, which is a strategic advantage.\n\nNext turn, I aim to anticipate my enemy's moves and position myself in a way that doesn't lead to self-harm or a direct confrontation with other snakes nearby.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"
