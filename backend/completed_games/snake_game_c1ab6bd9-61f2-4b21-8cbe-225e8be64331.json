            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,6). There are apples at (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), (6,7), and (1,6). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (4,7), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (0,6), which is on the bottom row, sixth column from the left.\n\nApples are scattered around:\n\n- (7,9): that's towards the top right.\n\n- (6,3): a bit to the right and up.\n\n- (1,2): just above me, to the left.\n\n- (6,7): up and to the right.\n\n- (1,6): directly above me.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,7), which is a bit above and to the right of me.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest, avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself or walls.\n\nLet me think about the distances:\n\n- (1,6): it's directly above me, just one step up.\n\n- (1,2): that's four steps up and four to the left.\n\n- (6,3): six steps up and three to the right.\n\n- (6,7): six steps up and one to the right.\n\n- (7,9): seven steps up and three to the right.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,6), just one step up.\n\nBut I need to think about whether that's the best choice. If I take that apple, I grow longer, which could make it harder to maneuver later.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake at (4,7). If I move up to (1,6), I'll be closer to the enemy. Maybe I should try to go for a different apple that's farther away, so I can stay away from the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe I can try to block the enemy snake by occupying certain positions.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's moves. Maybe it's better to focus on getting as many apples as possible quickly.\n\nLet me look at the board again.\n\nMy position: (0,6)\n\nApples:\n\n- (1,6): directly above me.\n\n- (1,2): above and to the left.\n\n- (6,3): up and to the right.\n\n- (6,7): up and to the right.\n\n- (7,9): up and to the right.\n\nEnemy snake: (4,7)\n\nHmm.\n\nIf I take (1,6), I grow to length 2. Then, I can consider moving to (1,2), which is next.\n\nBut to get to (1,2), I need to move left from (1,6). But I need to make sure that I don't collide with myself or the enemy.\n\nWait, from (1,6) to (1,5), then (1,4), and so on to (1,2).\n\nBut I need to check if the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,3) or (6,7) first.\n\nLet me think about the path to (6,3):\n\nFrom (0,6) to (6,3):\n\n- Move right to (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), then up to (1,9), (2,9), ..., (6,9), then left to (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), ..., (6,3).\n\nThat seems like a long path.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (1,6), then (2,6), ..., (6,6), then left to (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n\nThat's seven steps up and three left, total ten steps.\n\nBut that might take too many moves, and I might be overtaken by the enemy.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should try to collect the apples that are closer to me first, to gain length and protection.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- (1,6): one step up.\n\n- (1,2): four steps up and four left.\n\n- (6,3): six steps up and three right.\n\n- (6,7): six steps up and one right.\n\n- (7,9): seven steps up and three right.\n\nSo, (1,6) is the closest.\n\nIf I take (1,6), I grow, then maybe go to (1,2), which is four steps left.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (1,2) directly.\n\nWait, from (0,6) to (1,2):\n\n- Move up to (1,6), then left to (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2).\n\nThat's one up and four left, total five steps.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is at (4,7), so it's not in my path.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself.\n\nIf I take (1,6), my tail will be at (0,6), and my head at (1,6).\n\nThen, moving left to (1,5), then (1,4), etc., should be fine, as long as I don't turn back onto my own body.\n\nWait, but in snake games, you can't move back onto your own body.\n\nSo, as long as I don't make a U-turn, I should be fine.\n\nBut I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (6,7) or (6,3).\n\nLet me think about the path to (6,7):\n\nFrom (0,6) to (6,7):\n\n- Move up to (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), then up to (6,7).\n\nThat's six up and one right, total seven steps.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,6) to (6,7):\n\n- Move right to (0,7), then up to (1,7), (2,7), ..., (6,7).\n\nThat's one right and six up, also seven steps.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut I need to see which path is safer.\n\nIf I move right to (0,7), then up to (6,7), I need to make sure that nothing is in my way.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is on the way if I take the right path.\n\nWait, if I move right to (0,7), then up to (1,7), (2,7), ..., (4,7), but there's an enemy at (4,7).\n\nSo, if I move up to (4,7), I might collide with the enemy.\n\nThat could be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, if I go up to (6,6), then right to (6,7), the enemy is at (4,7), which is below me.\n\nSo, perhaps that's a safer path.\n\nBut I need to consider that the enemy might move towards me.\n\nI don't know the enemy's behavior, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nMaybe I should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to block the enemy by occupying certain positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should aim for the apple at (1,2), which is directly above me and to the left.\n\nFrom (0,6) to (1,2):\n\n- Up to (1,6), then left to (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2).\n\nThat's one up and four left, total five steps.\n\nI need to make sure that I can safely make those moves without colliding with the enemy or myself.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path, I think this is a feasible path.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I can then consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's see, after (1,2), where to go next.\n\nMaybe to (6,3).\n\nFrom (1,2) to (6,3):\n\n- Move down to (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then right to (6,3).\n\nThat's five down and one right, total six steps.\n\nAlternatively, move right to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), then down to (2,6), (3,6), ..., (6,6), then right to (6,7), etc. That seems longer.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,2), then right to (6,3) seems more efficient.\n\nBut I need to check if the path is clear.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is up and to the right.\n\nProbably not in my way if I move down and right.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1.

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. I'm snake number 2, currently at position (0,7). There are apples at (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), (6,7), and (1,6). There's also an enemy snake at (5,7), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let's visualize it:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: 2 . . . . 1 A . . .\n\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (0,7), which is in row 7, column 0.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (7,9): row 9, column 7\n\n- (6,3): row 3, column 6\n\n- (1,2): row 2, column 1\n\n- (6,7): row 7, column 6\n\n- (1,6): row 6, column 1\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,7): row 7, column 5\n\nOkay, so I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. Proximity: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. Safety: Avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\n3. Future moves: Choosing an apple that sets me up well for grabbing more apples afterward.\n\nLet's look at the distances to each apple from my current position (0,7):\n\n- (7,9): That's 7 steps up and 2 steps right.\n\n- (6,3): 6 steps up and 3 steps right.\n\n- (1,2): 1 step up and 5 steps left.\n\n- (6,7): 6 steps up and 6 steps right.\n\n- (1,6): 1 step up and 1 step left.\n\nHmm, the closest apple seems to be (1,6), which is just one step up and one step left. That's very close. But I need to consider if that's the best choice.\n\nIf I go for (1,6), I'll grow in length, which could make maneuvering more difficult later on. Also, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's position and potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,7), which is above me. If I move up to (1,6), I'll be even higher up, potentially getting closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's farther away but allows me to stay away from the enemy.\n\nLet me think about the apple at (1,2), which is one step up and five steps left. That's another close apple. But moving that far left might put me in a corner, which could limit my options.\n\nThe apple at (6,7) is six steps up and six steps right. That's a longer path, but it might allow me to get away from the enemy.\n\nWait, but the enemy is only at (5,7), which is above me but to the right. If I move up and to the right, I might still encounter the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving to the right could be risky because there are other apples in that direction, and the enemy might be trying to get to them as well.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (6,3), which is six steps up and three steps right. That's another option.\n\nBut perhaps I should prioritize the apples that are closer to me to minimize the risk.\n\nMaybe I should make a list of the apples in order of proximity and consider them one by one.\n\nFirst, (1,6) is very close, just one step up and one left.\n\nIf I go there, I'll be at (1,6). Then, I can consider my next move.\n\nFrom (1,6), I could go to (1,2), which is four steps left.\n\nAlternatively, I could go to (6,7), which is five steps down and one right.\n\nWait, no, from (1,6), to (6,7), that would be five steps down and one step right.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy's position and potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,7), which is between me and (6,7). So, if I try to go to (6,7), I might run into the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (1,2), which is left and up, the enemy is down and to the right, so perhaps that's safer.\n\nBut I need to think about the entire board and plan a sequence of moves.\n\nMaybe I should consider a strategy where I collect the closest apples first and try to maximize the number of apples I can get without risking running into the enemy.\n\nAnother factor is that when I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could make it harder to maneuver.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider eating smaller apples first to minimize growth initially.\n\nWait, but in this game, all apples seem to be the same size, so maybe that's not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for apples that allow me to block the enemy's path.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's behavior, that might be speculative.\n\nLet me try to prioritize the apples based on distance.\n\nFrom my current position (0,7):\n\n- (1,6): distance of 1 step up and 1 step left, total steps: sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), approximately 1.41.\n\n- (1,2): 1 step up and 5 steps left, total steps: sqrt(1^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(26), approximately 5.1.\n\n- (6,7): 6 steps up and 6 steps right, total steps: sqrt(6^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(72), approximately 8.49.\n\n- (6,3): 6 steps up and 3 steps right, total steps: sqrt(6^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(45), approximately 6.7.\n\n- (7,9): 7 steps up and 2 steps right, total steps: sqrt(7^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(53), approximately 7.28.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,6), followed by (1,2), then (6,3), (6,7), and finally (7,9).\n\nGiven that, maybe I should go for (1,6) first, since it's the closest.\n\nBut I need to consider what happens after I eat that apple.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), I'll grow longer, and my tail will extend.\n\nI need to make sure that my path after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf I go to (1,6), then perhaps move to (1,2), as it's relatively close.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can then consider moving to another apple.\n\nBut I need to plan the path carefully to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (6,3) after (1,6).\n\nLet me think about the path:\n\n- From (0,7) to (1,6): up to (1,7), then left to (1,6).\n\n- Then, from (1,6) to (6,3): down to (6,6), then left to (6,3).\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nWait, from (1,7) to (1,6), that's moving left.\n\nThen, from (1,6), I can move down to (2,6), then (3,6), ..., up to (6,6), then left to (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n\nI need to ensure that none of these positions are occupied by the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (5,7), which is not on my path, and assuming I don't turn back onto my own body, this should be safe.\n\nAlso, after eating (1,6), my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't cut off my own path.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so you have to be careful not to turn back onto your own tail.\n\nIn this case, since I'm moving up and left, then down and left, I should be okay as long as I don't make sharp turns back onto my own body.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different"
