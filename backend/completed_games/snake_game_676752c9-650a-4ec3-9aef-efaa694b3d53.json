I'd have to move 4 units to the right to reach it.\n\nHowever, I notice that there's an apple at (4, 1), which is just 8 units down from my current position. That's a much more manageable distance. If I head down, I can grab that apple and grow my snake.\n\nAs for the enemy snake, Snake #2 is at position (9, 3) with no body, so it's not an immediate threat.\n\nMy strategy for next turn will be to continue heading down to grab the apple at (4, 1) and then reassess the board state.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

I'll take a step back and assess the situation more carefully.\n\nI notice that I'm quite far from the top of the board, so I might want to start moving upwards to get a better view of the board and potentially find more apples. However, I also don't want to leave myself exposed to the other snakes, so I'll need to be cautious.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move to the right, which will give me a bit more space to maneuver and allow me to assess the situation better. I'll also be keeping an eye out for any potential opportunities to grab an apple.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
