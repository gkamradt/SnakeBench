Moving towards this apple is a straightforward strategy that avoids any immediate risks and also keeps me in a position to subsequently move towards the apple at (6, 6). After collecting these two apples, I will have a good score advantage and can plan my next moves.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is currently at (2, 7) with its body at (1, 7), which means it is moving horizontally to the left. This movement pattern suggests that it might continue moving left, which should keep it away from my intended path for the next few turns.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be UP, to align myself with the column that will lead me to the apple at (5, 6). After collecting this apple, I will continue moving up to collect the apple at (6, 6). I will need to be cautious after collecting the second apple, as it will increase my size and reduce the available space for maneuvering.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving up to collect the apple at (5, 6), continue moving up to collect the apple at (6, 6).
