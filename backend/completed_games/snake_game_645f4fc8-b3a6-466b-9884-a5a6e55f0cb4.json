I must avoid moving into their positions or within a threat radius of their presence.\n\n### Potential Moves from (8, 1):\n1. **UP to (8, 2)**: \n   - This option is valid and moves into an open space. The y-coordinate increases, and there are no immediate threats nearby. This move progresses me closer to the middle area of the board where more apple opportunities might exist.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 0)**: \n   - This move would take me back to (8, 0), but since I've just moved from there, it would not be useful and does not gather points.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 1)**: \n   - This would relocate me back to (7, 1), which is not useful and runs the risk of creating a situation where I hit my own body in future moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 1)**:\n   - This move goes out of bounds because my x-coordinate would extend beyond the game limits. Thus, it's an invalid move.\n\n### Evaluation of Best Move:\nBased on the current options, moving **UP to (8, 2)** seems to be the most advantageous. It allows me to grow vertically without putting me in immediate danger from the enemy snake. Additionally, it positions me in a fresh area with the potential to explore other paths towards apples later.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\n- My immediate goal will be to navigate toward the upper rows while keeping an eye on the enemy snake movements.\n- I will aim to avoid any collision with the enemy or its body. \n- I should try to eventually move toward the left side where more apples are, while staying at a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on all facts considered, my next move will be: \n**UP**."

I must avoid moving into their positions or within a threat radius of their presence.\n\n### Potential Moves from (8, 1):\n1. **UP to (8, 2)**: \n   - This option is valid and moves into an open space. The y-coordinate increases, and there are no immediate threats nearby. This move progresses me closer to the middle area of the board where more apple opportunities might exist.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 0)**: \n   - This move would take me back to (8, 0), but since I've just moved from there, it would not be useful and does not gather points.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 1)**: \n   - This would relocate me back to (7, 1), which is not useful and runs the risk of creating a situation where I hit my own body in future moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 1)**:\n   - This move goes out of bounds because my x-coordinate would extend beyond the game limits. Thus, it's an invalid move.\n\n### Evaluation of Best Move:\nBased on the current options, moving **UP to (8, 2)** seems to be the most advantageous. It allows me to grow vertically without putting me in immediate danger from the enemy snake. Additionally, it positions me in a fresh area with the potential to explore other paths towards apples later.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\n- My immediate goal will be to navigate toward the upper rows while keeping an eye on the enemy snake movements.\n- I will aim to avoid any collision with the enemy or its body. \n- I should try to eventually move toward the left side where more apples are, while staying at a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on all facts considered, my next move will be: \n**UP**."

I'm at (8, 0), and there shouldn't be a direct threat from the enemy as long as I don't move towards (7, 4) or (6, 4).\n\n### Possible Moves from (8, 0):\n1. **UP to (8, 1)**: \n   - This move is valid, but again brings me toward an unused area with no immediate gains\u2014there are no apples above (as seen by coordinates).\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, -1)**: \n   - Out of bounds, invalid move.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 0)**:\n   - This would bring me into the same row but decrease my x coordinate, closer to the enemy at (7, 5) and would only lead me further from my primary goal of collecting apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 0)**:\n   - This doesn't bring me any closer to apples and keeps me on the same row.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\nGiven these options, going UP to (8, 1) is the best move. While it does not take me straight to an apple, it does keep me alive and moving forward.\n\n### Planned Strategy:\nI need to avoid the current enemy traps while looking for a secure path toward apples later. I may also need to reconsider heading generally towards the upper areas of the board as the enemy snake is positioned in the lower range, which might open up opportunities on subsequent turns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current state and best potential outcomes, my next move will be to:\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

I must avoid moving into their positions or within a threat radius of their presence.\n\n### Potential Moves from (8, 1):\n1. **UP to (8, 2)**: \n   - This option is valid and moves into an open space. The y-coordinate increases, and there are no immediate threats nearby. This move progresses me closer to the middle area of the board where more apple opportunities might exist.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 0)**: \n   - This move would take me back to (8, 0), but since I've just moved from there, it would not be useful and does not gather points.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 1)**: \n   - This would relocate me back to (7, 1), which is not useful and runs the risk of creating a situation where I hit my own body in future moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 1)**:\n   - This move goes out of bounds because my x-coordinate would extend beyond the game limits. Thus, it's an invalid move.\n\n### Evaluation of Best Move:\nBased on the current options, moving **UP to (8, 2)** seems to be the most advantageous. It allows me to grow vertically without putting me in immediate danger from the enemy snake. Additionally, it positions me in a fresh area with the potential to explore other paths towards apples later.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\n- My immediate goal will be to navigate toward the upper rows while keeping an eye on the enemy snake movements.\n- I will aim to avoid any collision with the enemy or its body. \n- I should try to eventually move toward the left side where more apples are, while staying at a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on all facts considered, my next move will be: \n**UP**."

While it does not take me straight to an apple, it does keep me alive and moving forward.\n\n### Planned Strategy:\nI need to avoid the current enemy traps while looking for a secure path toward apples later.

It allows me to grow vertically without putting me in immediate danger from the enemy snake. Additionally, it positions me in a fresh area with the potential to explore other paths towards apples later.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\n- My immediate goal will be to navigate toward the upper rows while keeping an eye on the enemy snake movements.\n- I will aim to avoid any collision with the enemy or its body. \n- I should try to eventually move toward the left side where more apples are, while staying at a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on all facts considered, my next move will be: \n**UP**."

It allows me to grow vertically without putting me in immediate danger from the enemy snake. Additionally, it positions me in a fresh area with the potential to explore other paths towards apples later.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\n- My immediate goal will be to navigate toward the upper rows while keeping an eye on the enemy snake movements.\n- I will aim to avoid any collision with the enemy or its body. \n- I should try to eventually move toward the left side where more apples are, while staying at a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on all facts considered, my next move will be: \n**UP**."

They are somewhat away from my immediate area, but my next move should still keep me out of reach of their potential movement.\n\n### Potential Moves from (8, 4):\n1. **UP to (8, 5)**:\n   - The space is open, however, it does not lead toward any apples directly.\n   \n2. **DOWN to (8, 3)**:\n   - This move would take me back into my own body (to position (8,3)), which is not allowed.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 4)**:\n   - This position is open but also does not lead to any apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 4)**:\n   - This position is open and importantly, there is an apple located at (9, 4).

This move progresses me closer to the middle area of the board where more apple opportunities might exist.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 0)**: \n   - This move would take me back to (8, 0), but since I've just moved from there, it would not be useful and does not gather points.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 1)**: \n   - This would relocate me back to (7, 1), which is not useful and runs the risk of creating a situation where I hit my own body in future moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 1)**:\n   - This move goes out of bounds because my x-coordinate would extend beyond the game limits.

It allows me to grow vertically without putting me in immediate danger from the enemy snake. Additionally, it positions me in a fresh area with the potential to explore other paths towards apples later.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\n- My immediate goal will be to navigate toward the upper rows while keeping an eye on the enemy snake movements.\n- I will aim to avoid any collision with the enemy or its body. \n- I should try to eventually move toward the left side where more apples are, while staying at a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on all facts considered, my next move will be: \n**UP**."

This move does not put me in danger from the enemy snake either.\n\n### Strategic Moves Going Forward\nAfter collecting the apple, I should keep examining the board for the best path toward more apples while avoiding the enemy snake's body and planning for future turns to maintain a safe distance from enemy attacks.\n\n### Final Decision\nGiven my analysis, I will move **RIGHT to (9, 4)** to collect the apple.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

The y-coordinate increases, and there are no immediate threats nearby. This move progresses me closer to the middle area of the board where more apple opportunities might exist.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 0)**: \n   - This move would take me back to (8, 0), but since I've just moved from there, it would not be useful and does not gather points.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 1)**: \n   - This would relocate me back to (7, 1), which is not useful and runs the risk of creating a situation where I hit my own body in future moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 1)**:\n   - This move goes out of bounds because my x-coordinate would extend beyond the game limits. Thus, it's an invalid move.\n\n### Evaluation of Best Move:\nBased on the current options, moving **UP to (8, 2)** seems to be the most advantageous. It allows me to grow vertically without putting me in immediate danger from the enemy snake. Additionally, it positions me in a fresh area with the potential to explore other paths towards apples later.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\n- My immediate goal will be to navigate toward the upper rows while keeping an eye on the enemy snake movements.\n- I will aim to avoid any collision with the enemy or its body. \n- I should try to eventually move toward the left side where more apples are, while staying at a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on all facts considered, my next move will be: \n**UP**."

However, it's also a potential danger zone as it moves towards the enemy snake's section. \n\n2. **DOWN to (9, 6)**:\n   - This position takes me back to where I just came from (illegal move).\n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 7)**:\n   - This position is also open as there\u2019s no other snake or apple here.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 7)**:\n   - This move is out of bounds (illegal move).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **UP to (9, 8)**: This move keeps me next to the enemy snake. If the enemy decides to go down or left, I would run the risk of running into its body. I need to be cautious.\n  \n- **LEFT to (8, 7)**: This position is safe, allowing me to avoid any confrontation with the enemy snake while giving me space to maneuver. \n\n### Future Strategy:\n- My goal is to steer clear of the enemy snake and navigate towards the apples. I need to maintain a cautious approach by staying away from the left side of the board near (1, 8) and make lateral moves that allow me access to safer apple locations such as (3, 4) or (1, 5) in the future.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I\u2019ll opt to move LEFT to (8, 7). This makes the most sense strategically, keeping me away from any immediate threats while allowing me to think about future apple moves.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

It is also currently below my level, which makes me a bit less vulnerable to direct attacks from Snake #2.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 7)**:\n   - This move is also open, but it's moving further left and away from the center of the board, which could limit my options in future turns.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 7)**:\n   - This move takes me back to where I just came from (illegal move).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **UP to (8, 8)**: Not possible as it is occupied by my own body.\n  \n- **DOWN to (8, 6)**: This is the safest move available. I can still maneuver toward apple locations on future turns and distance myself from the enemy.\n\n- **LEFT to (7, 7)**: While available, it doesn't provide much room for mobility and takes me deeper into a corner that could restrict my options later.\n\n### Strategic Thinking:\nStaying agile is key now to evade any potential traps from the enemy snake. Moving down to (8, 6) keeps me clear while setting up for a future opportunity to go for apples located further along the board. If I move down, my next moves can include moving toward the left side where apples are present.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose to move DOWN to (8, 6).
