Let's see what's around me.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- Apples are at (4,5), (4,3), (6,0), (7,6), and (8,4).\n\n- Enemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (8,1) with no body listed, so probably just the head.\n\n- My snake is at (7,9), and since it's the only part mentioned, I assume it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about where to move next. My options are up, down, left, or right. I need to avoid walls, other snakes, and myself. Also, I want to eat apples to grow and score points.\n\nLet me consider each possible move:\n\n1. **UP** (increase Y by 1): From (7,9) to (7,10). But Y=10 is outside the board (maximum Y is 9), so that's a wall. Can't go up.\n\n2. **DOWN** (decrease Y by 1): From (7,9) to (7,8). Let's see what's at (7,8). Looking at the board, position (7,8) is empty (denoted by '.'). So, it's safe to move there.\n\n3. **LEFT** (decrease X by 1): From (7,9) to (6,9). Check position (6,9). It's empty, so safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (increase X by 1): From (7,9) to (8,9). Check position (8,9). It's empty, so safe.\n\nSo, I can move down, left, or right.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction is best. I should consider which move gets me closer to an apple without putting me in danger.\n\nLet's look at the positions of the apples:\n\n- (4,5): That's quite a way down and to the left from my current position.\n\n- (4,3): Even further down and to the left.\n\n- (6,0): Down and left, quite far.\n\n- (7,6): Down a bit, same X.\n\n- (8,4): Down and to the right.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (8,1). I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nLet me think about each possible move:\n\n- **DOWN to (7,8)**: That's towards the apple at (7,6). Maybe I can head that way.\n\n- **LEFT to (6,9)**: That might take me towards some apples, but I need to see the path.\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,9)**: That's closer to the apple at (8,4), but also closer to the enemy at (8,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize the apple that's closest or most accessible.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board better.\n\nGiven that Y increases upwards, here's a rough mental map:\n\n- I'm at (7,9), which is in the top-middle area.\n\n- Apples are at:\n\n- (4,5): somewhat below and to the left.\n\n- (4,3): further down and left.\n\n- (6,0): bottom-left.\n\n- (7,6): below me, same X.\n\n- (8,4): below and to the right.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,1): bottom-right area.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nMaybe I should aim for the apple at (7,6) since it's directly below me.\n\nLet me see the path to (7,6):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,8), then (7,7), then (7,6). That seems straightforward, assuming the path is clear.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles between (7,9) and (7,6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (7,9): me\n\n- (7,8): empty\n\n- (7,7): empty\n\n- (7,6): apple\n\nSo, moving down to (7,8), then (7,7), then (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems safe for now.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's movement. Snake #1 is at (8,1), and it could move up towards me.\n\nI need to anticipate its possible moves.\n\nBut for now, since it's far away, maybe I can focus on getting the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can decide my next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for another apple that might be less contested.\n\nBut right now, (7,6) seems the closest and most direct.\n\nSo, for this turn, I think I'll move down to (7,8).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue moving down to (7,7), and then to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable plan for now.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving down to (7,8) seems safe and productive.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

But I need to think about what happens after that. If I eat the apple, I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that the path after that is clear.\n\n- **UP to (7,8)**: That takes me away from the apple at (7,6), which might not be ideal. But maybe there are other apples up there that I can target.\n\n- **LEFT to (6,7)**: That could lead me towards some apples, but it's not directly towards any of them.\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**: That's towards the enemy snake at (8,3). I need to be careful, but it might also lead me to the apple at (8,4).\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the immediate benefit. Moving down to (7,6) allows me to eat an apple right away, which is attractive. But I need to plan a few steps ahead.\n\nSuppose I move down to (7,6) and eat the apple. My snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,7).\n\nNext turn, I need to decide where to move from (7,6). My options would be:\n\n- UP to (7,7), but that's where my tail is, which is now part of my body. So, I can't go back there immediately.\n\n- DOWN to (7,5). Let's see what's at (7,5). From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- LEFT to (6,6): Let's check that.\n\n- RIGHT to (8,6): Let's check that too.\n\nSo, from (7,6), I could move down to (7,5), left to (6,6), or right to (8,6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (7,5): empty.\n\n- (6,6): empty.\n\n- (8,6): empty.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,6), I have options for where to go next.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's possible moves. Snake #1 is at (8,3). It could move up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move down to (7,6), and then down to (7,5), the enemy snake might move towards me, but for now, it seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (7,8), I'm moving away from the apple, but perhaps I can find another apple up there.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no apples immediately up at (7,9), but perhaps I can navigate towards (4,5) or other apples.\n\nBut that seems like a longer path, and I might give the enemy snake an opportunity to grow and block my path.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,6) is right below me, so it's the most immediate.\n\nAnother consideration is that if I move down to (7,6), I'm potentially opening up paths for the enemy snake to move towards other apples.\n\nBut right now, the enemy is at (8,3), which is not immediately threatening.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's best to prioritize eating the apple at (7,6) to grow and secure that point.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

Also, I want to eat apples to grow and score points.\n\nLet me consider each possible move:\n\n1. **UP** (increase Y by 1): From (7,9) to (7,10). But Y=10 is outside the board (maximum Y is 9), so that's a wall. Can't go up.\n\n2. **DOWN** (decrease Y by 1): From (7,9) to (7,8). Let's see what's at (7,8). Looking at the board, position (7,8) is empty (denoted by '.'). So, it's safe to move there.\n\n3. **LEFT** (decrease X by 1): From (7,9) to (6,9). Check position (6,9). It's empty, so safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (increase X by 1): From (7,9) to (8,9). Check position (8,9). It's empty, so safe.\n\nSo, I can move down, left, or right.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction is best. I should consider which move gets me closer to an apple without putting me in danger.\n\nLet's look at the positions of the apples:\n\n- (4,5): That's quite a way down and to the left from my current position.\n\n- (4,3): Even further down and to the left.\n\n- (6,0): Down and left, quite far.\n\n- (7,6): Down a bit, same X.\n\n- (8,4): Down and to the right.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (8,1). I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nLet me think about each possible move:\n\n- **DOWN to (7,8)**: That's towards the apple at (7,6). Maybe I can head that way.\n\n- **LEFT to (6,9)**: That might take me towards some apples, but I need to see the path.\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,9)**: That's closer to the apple at (8,4), but also closer to the enemy at (8,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize the apple that's closest or most accessible.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board better.\n\nGiven that Y increases upwards, here's a rough mental map:\n\n- I'm at (7,9), which is in the top-middle area.\n\n- Apples are at:\n\n- (4,5): somewhat below and to the left.\n\n- (4,3): further down and left.\n\n- (6,0): bottom-left.\n\n- (7,6): below me, same X.\n\n- (8,4): below and to the right.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,1): bottom-right area.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nMaybe I should aim for the apple at (7,6) since it's directly below me.\n\nLet me see the path to (7,6):\n\nFrom (7,9) to (7,8), then (7,7), then (7,6). That seems straightforward, assuming the path is clear.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles between (7,9) and (7,6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (7,9): me\n\n- (7,8): empty\n\n- (7,7): empty\n\n- (7,6): apple\n\nSo, moving down to (7,8), then (7,7), then (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems safe for now.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's movement. Snake #1 is at (8,1), and it could move up towards me.\n\nI need to anticipate its possible moves.\n\nBut for now, since it's far away, maybe I can focus on getting the apple at (7,6).\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can decide my next move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for another apple that might be less contested.\n\nBut right now, (7,6) seems the closest and most direct.\n\nSo, for this turn, I think I'll move down to (7,8).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue moving down to (7,7), and then to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable plan for now.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving down to (7,8) seems safe and productive.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

But I need to think about what happens after that. If I eat the apple, I'll grow, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that the path after that is clear.\n\n- **UP to (7,8)**: That takes me away from the apple at (7,6), which might not be ideal. But maybe there are other apples up there that I can target.\n\n- **LEFT to (6,7)**: That could lead me towards some apples, but it's not directly towards any of them.\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**: That's towards the enemy snake at (8,3). I need to be careful, but it might also lead me to the apple at (8,4).\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the immediate benefit. Moving down to (7,6) allows me to eat an apple right away, which is attractive. But I need to plan a few steps ahead.\n\nSuppose I move down to (7,6) and eat the apple. My snake will grow, so I'll have a tail segment at (7,7).\n\nNext turn, I need to decide where to move from (7,6). My options would be:\n\n- UP to (7,7), but that's where my tail is, which is now part of my body. So, I can't go back there immediately.\n\n- DOWN to (7,5). Let's see what's at (7,5). From the board, it seems empty.\n\n- LEFT to (6,6): Let's check that.\n\n- RIGHT to (8,6): Let's check that too.\n\nSo, from (7,6), I could move down to (7,5), left to (6,6), or right to (8,6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (7,5): empty.\n\n- (6,6): empty.\n\n- (8,6): empty.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,6), I have options for where to go next.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's possible moves.
