Note that I just ate the apple at (5,5) last turn.\nEnemy snake 2 is at (4, 6) with body at [(4, 7), (4, 8)].\n\nMy options:\n* UP: (5, 5) -> (5, 6) - Empty space.\n* DOWN: (5, 5) -> (5, 4) - Empty space.\n* LEFT: (5, 5) -> (4, 5) - Tail. This is okay this turn since I grew last turn.\n* RIGHT: (5, 5) -> (6, 5) - Empty space.\n\nI want to move towards the closest apple. The available apples are at (5, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6), (7, 3), (7, 9).\nDistances:\n(5,2): 0 right, 3 down. total 3 moves\n(0,0): 5 left, 5 down. total 10 moves\n(9,6): 4 right, 1 up. total 5 moves\n(7,3): 2 right, 2 down. total 4 moves\n(7,9): 2 right, 4 up. total 6 moves\n\nThe closest apple appears to be at (5, 2) which is directly below me, but that would require moving down, down, down.\nLet's look for a safer path.\n\n(7,3) is only 4 moves away. And requires going right, right, down, down.\n\n(9,6) is 5 moves away. And requires going right, right, right, right, up. This path might bring me near enemy snake.\n\n(7,9) is 6 moves away. And requires going right, right, up, up, up, up.\n\nI think moving down is the best approach to get to (5,2) or (7,3).\n\nNext turn, let's reassess and see if it makes sense to move towards the (5,2) or (7,3) apple. If the enemy snake gets in the way, we'll have to reroute.\n\nNEXT MOVE: DOWN"
