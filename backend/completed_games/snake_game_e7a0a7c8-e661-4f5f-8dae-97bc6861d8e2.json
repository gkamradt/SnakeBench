A move to the left wouldn't be feasible as I am already at (2, 2) based on the latest update.\n\n- **Target Apples Analysis:** \n  - After eating the apple at (2, 2):\n    - The next closest apple is at (3, 1) relatively close and easy to access.\n    - The apple at (3, 9) is also appealing but requires navigating up the board which requires careful movement to avoid the boundary and enemy snakes.\n\n- **Enemy Snake Proximity:** Snake #2's closest body part is at (5, 6), which is still relatively distant. Immediate conflict is unlikely.\n\n- **Strategic Move Consideration:**\n  - Because I am currently on top of an apple at (2, 2), I should first assume to consume it.\n  - After consuming, my next plan should focus on acquiring the apple at (3, 1) as this keeps me away from enemy bodies and provides a strategic pathway towards other apples without hitting boundaries.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- After eating the apple at (2, 2), a sensible and strategic move would be to proceed `RIGHT` to (3, 2) to align spatially for the downward apple at (3, 1).\n- However, considering the potential path for longer terms, aiming for a `DOWN` move directly to eat the apple at (3, 1) next, after claiming the one at (2, 2), allows me to then perhaps navigate upwards towards other apples safely.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT (to properly position towards an easier path for the apple at (3, 1) after consuming the apple at the current position of (2, 2))."
