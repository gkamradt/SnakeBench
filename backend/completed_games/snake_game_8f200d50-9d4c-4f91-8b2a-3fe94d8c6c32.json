The enemy snake is still at (5, 7) with its body at [(5, 6)], which doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\nI should continue moving left to reach the apple at (3, 7). After that, I'll need to assess the updated board state and decide on my next target.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching the apple at (3, 7), I should consider the next closest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake moves closer to me or the apples, I may need to adjust my strategy to avoid potential threats.\n\nMy next move: LEFT"
