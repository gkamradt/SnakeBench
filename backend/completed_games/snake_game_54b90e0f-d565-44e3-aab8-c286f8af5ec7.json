We should aim to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing paths that minimize risk and maximize accessibility to further apples.\n\n## Apple Analysis\n\nCurrently, there are five apples on the board:\n- Apple at (8, 4)\n- Apple at (2, 6)\n- Apple at (2, 4)\n- Apple at (0, 0)\n- Apple at (7, 4)\n\nStarting from (9, 0), the most immediate strategies would involve:\n- Moving towards (0, 0) first since it's on the same row.\n- However, (0, 0) is partly blocked by the enemy snake positioning at row 7 but is clear otherwise.\n- Alternatively, we could focus on the apples at (8, 4) and (7, 4) since they are closer in terms of reaching by upward movement and would prevent backtracking for other apples.\n\n## Potential Move Sequences\n\n1. **Move Towards (8, 4) and (7, 4) First:**\n   - This focuses on the apples closest vertically.

Hence, moving upwards seems like a solid strategy initially, aiming to reach either (8, 4) or (7, 4).\n\n### New Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- Move upwards initially and start collecting apples starting with (8, 4) and (7, 4).\n- Always check the nearest apple after eating one to minimize unnecessary movements.\n- Stay aware of the enemy snake's movement, especially as it comes closer to potential intersections.\n\n### Next Move Decision\n\n**UP**"

We should aim to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing paths that minimize risk and maximize accessibility to further apples.\n\n## Apple Analysis\n\nCurrently, there are five apples on the board:\n- Apple at (8, 4)\n- Apple at (2, 6)\n- Apple at (2, 4)\n- Apple at (0, 0)\n- Apple at (7, 4)\n\nStarting from (9, 0), the most immediate strategies would involve:\n- Moving towards (0, 0) first since it's on the same row.\n- However, (0, 0) is partly blocked by the enemy snake positioning at row 7 but is clear otherwise.\n- Alternatively, we could focus on the apples at (8, 4) and (7, 4) since they are closer in terms of reaching by upward movement and would prevent backtracking for other apples.\n\n## Potential Move Sequences\n\n1. **Move Towards (8, 4) and (7, 4) First:**\n   - This focuses on the apples closest vertically. Moving directly upwards will allow retrieval of apples in the same column.\n  \n2. **Move Towards (0, 0):**\n   - This is a longer-term strategy but positions us for potentially capturing the apple at the starting corner.\n\n## Immediate Move Decision\n\nCurrently being positioned at (9, 0), a direct right move will take us out of bounds, and a left move won't provide us with immediate apple access. Hence, moving upwards seems like a solid strategy initially, aiming to reach either (8, 4) or (7, 4).\n\n### New Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- Move upwards initially and start collecting apples starting with (8, 4) and (7, 4).\n- Always check the nearest apple after eating one to minimize unnecessary movements.\n- Stay aware of the enemy snake's movement, especially as it comes closer to potential intersections.\n\n### Next Move Decision\n\n**UP**"

This continues safely towards a known apple destination without immediate structural or enemy hazards.

The enemy snake is currently at (0, 7) and has an empty body; thus, it poses no immediate threat to our movements. We should aim to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing paths that minimize risk and maximize accessibility to further apples.\n\n## Apple Analysis\n\nCurrently, there are five apples on the board:\n- Apple at (8, 4)\n- Apple at (2, 6)\n- Apple at (2, 4)\n- Apple at (0, 0)\n- Apple at (7, 4)\n\nStarting from (9, 0), the most immediate strategies would involve:\n- Moving towards (0, 0) first since it's on the same row.\n- However, (0, 0) is partly blocked by the enemy snake positioning at row 7 but is clear otherwise.\n- Alternatively, we could focus on the apples at (8, 4) and (7, 4) since they are closer in terms of reaching by upward movement and would prevent backtracking for other apples.\n\n## Potential Move Sequences\n\n1. **Move Towards (8, 4) and (7, 4) First:**\n   - This focuses on the apples closest vertically. Moving directly upwards will allow retrieval of apples in the same column.\n  \n2. **Move Towards (0, 0):**\n   - This is a longer-term strategy but positions us for potentially capturing the apple at the starting corner.\n\n## Immediate Move Decision\n\nCurrently being positioned at (9, 0), a direct right move will take us out of bounds, and a left move won't provide us with immediate apple access. Hence, moving upwards seems like a solid strategy initially, aiming to reach either (8, 4) or (7, 4).\n\n### New Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- Move upwards initially and start collecting apples starting with (8, 4) and (7, 4).\n- Always check the nearest apple after eating one to minimize unnecessary movements.\n- Stay aware of the enemy snake's movement, especially as it comes closer to potential intersections.\n\n### Next Move Decision\n\n**UP**"

This continues safely towards a known apple destination without immediate structural or enemy hazards.

The enemy snake is currently at (0, 7) and has an empty body; thus, it poses no immediate threat to our movements. We should aim to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing paths that minimize risk and maximize accessibility to further apples.\n\n## Apple Analysis\n\nCurrently, there are five apples on the board:\n- Apple at (8, 4)\n- Apple at (2, 6)\n- Apple at (2, 4)\n- Apple at (0, 0)\n- Apple at (7, 4)\n\nStarting from (9, 0), the most immediate strategies would involve:\n- Moving towards (0, 0) first since it's on the same row.\n- However, (0, 0) is partly blocked by the enemy snake positioning at row 7 but is clear otherwise.\n- Alternatively, we could focus on the apples at (8, 4) and (7, 4) since they are closer in terms of reaching by upward movement and would prevent backtracking for other apples.\n\n## Potential Move Sequences\n\n1. **Move Towards (8, 4) and (7, 4) First:**\n   - This focuses on the apples closest vertically. Moving directly upwards will allow retrieval of apples in the same column.\n  \n2. **Move Towards (0, 0):**\n   - This is a longer-term strategy but positions us for potentially capturing the apple at the starting corner.\n\n## Immediate Move Decision\n\nCurrently being positioned at (9, 0), a direct right move will take us out of bounds, and a left move won't provide us with immediate apple access. Hence, moving upwards seems like a solid strategy initially, aiming to reach either (8, 4) or (7, 4).\n\n### New Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- Move upwards initially and start collecting apples starting with (8, 4) and (7, 4).\n- Always check the nearest apple after eating one to minimize unnecessary movements.\n- Stay aware of the enemy snake's movement, especially as it comes closer to potential intersections.\n\n### Next Move Decision\n\n**UP**"

The enemy snake is currently at (0, 7) and has an empty body; thus, it poses no immediate threat to our movements. We should aim to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing paths that minimize risk and maximize accessibility to further apples.\n\n## Apple Analysis\n\nCurrently, there are five apples on the board:\n- Apple at (8, 4)\n- Apple at (2, 6)\n- Apple at (2, 4)\n- Apple at (0, 0)\n- Apple at (7, 4)\n\nStarting from (9, 0), the most immediate strategies would involve:\n- Moving towards (0, 0) first since it's on the same row.\n- However, (0, 0) is partly blocked by the enemy snake positioning at row 7 but is clear otherwise.\n- Alternatively, we could focus on the apples at (8, 4) and (7, 4) since they are closer in terms of reaching by upward movement and would prevent backtracking for other apples.\n\n## Potential Move Sequences\n\n1. **Move Towards (8, 4) and (7, 4) First:**\n   - This focuses on the apples closest vertically. Moving directly upwards will allow retrieval of apples in the same column.\n  \n2. **Move Towards (0, 0):**\n   - This is a longer-term strategy but positions us for potentially capturing the apple at the starting corner.\n\n## Immediate Move Decision\n\nCurrently being positioned at (9, 0), a direct right move will take us out of bounds, and a left move won't provide us with immediate apple access. Hence, moving upwards seems like a solid strategy initially, aiming to reach either (8, 4) or (7, 4).\n\n### New Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- Move upwards initially and start collecting apples starting with (8, 4) and (7, 4).\n- Always check the nearest apple after eating one to minimize unnecessary movements.\n- Stay aware of the enemy snake's movement, especially as it comes closer to potential intersections.\n\n### Next Move Decision\n\n**UP**"

This continues safely towards a known apple destination without immediate structural or enemy hazards.

The enemy snake is currently at (0, 7) and has an empty body; thus, it poses no immediate threat to our movements. We should aim to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing paths that minimize risk and maximize accessibility to further apples.\n\n## Apple Analysis\n\nCurrently, there are five apples on the board:\n- Apple at (8, 4)\n- Apple at (2, 6)\n- Apple at (2, 4)\n- Apple at (0, 0)\n- Apple at (7, 4)\n\nStarting from (9, 0), the most immediate strategies would involve:\n- Moving towards (0, 0) first since it's on the same row.\n- However, (0, 0) is partly blocked by the enemy snake positioning at row 7 but is clear otherwise.\n- Alternatively, we could focus on the apples at (8, 4) and (7, 4) since they are closer in terms of reaching by upward movement and would prevent backtracking for other apples.\n\n## Potential Move Sequences\n\n1. **Move Towards (8, 4) and (7, 4) First:**\n   - This focuses on the apples closest vertically. Moving directly upwards will allow retrieval of apples in the same column.\n  \n2. **Move Towards (0, 0):**\n   - This is a longer-term strategy but positions us for potentially capturing the apple at the starting corner.\n\n## Immediate Move Decision\n\nCurrently being positioned at (9, 0), a direct right move will take us out of bounds, and a left move won't provide us with immediate apple access. Hence, moving upwards seems like a solid strategy initially, aiming to reach either (8, 4) or (7, 4).\n\n### New Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- Move upwards initially and start collecting apples starting with (8, 4) and (7, 4).\n- Always check the nearest apple after eating one to minimize unnecessary movements.\n- Stay aware of the enemy snake's movement, especially as it comes closer to potential intersections.\n\n### Next Move Decision\n\n**UP**"

This continues safely towards a known apple destination without immediate structural or enemy hazards.

It moves us toward the cluster of closely positioned apples, potentially gaining two additional points quickly.\n\n2. **LEFT to (1, 4):** This would increase our distance from the nearest apples and place us closer to Snake #2, which is unwise.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (3, 4):** This move would backtrack us to the previous location, offering no immediate advantage, and it veers us away from the target apples.\n\n4. **DOWN to (2, 3):** While open, this move takes our snake further away from the immediate apple advantage and increases path length to apples.\n\n### Risks and Considerations\n\n- **UP to (2, 5)** is risk-free with an open path and positions us toward multiple apples.\n- Monitor Snake #2's movement. It is positioned one tile away from possible interference along the y-axis but should not pose an immediate threat if our movement remains upward.\n- Assess the proximity of enemy snakes with future planned paths to avoid unexpected confrontations.\n\n### Strategy\n\n- Focus on capturing the apples at (2, 6) and (2, 7) in succession, as they lie in a straightforward path along the y-axis.\n- Stay alert to Snake #2's movements, potentially causing future blockades or competition for apples.\n- Once apples at (2, 6) and (2, 7) are secured, analyze the new positions of apples and enemy snakes to determine the next optimal target.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the current board and objectives, the best and safest move is:\n\n**Decided Move: UP**"
