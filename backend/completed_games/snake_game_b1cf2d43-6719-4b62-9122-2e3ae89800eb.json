Let's move up with the aim to grab the apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving up, I will be positioned at (6,3), I need to move left 2 cells to reach the apple which is at (4,2). If in case, I observe that snake #2 has moved downwards, I will have to act quick and change my course to reach for another apple.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

However, this would involve moving through enemy territory with snake #2 last known to be upstairs and it might come down. I also notice a much closer apple to my current position at (8,4). This is just one cell to my right and one cell up, a much safer option.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to the right and grabbing the apple at (8,4), I'll be at (8,4). An interesting option would be to then go down and right for the apple at (9, 2) or go left-down-down for the apple at (5,2), depending on snake #2's move. I just need to keep looking out for snake #2 and adjust my route accordingly.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
