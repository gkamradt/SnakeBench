Continuing this direction also allows for an option to pivot towards (1,3) .\n2. **Right**: Moves us to (6, 6).

This is still a valid and strategic move since we are not moving close to any other snake and we are closer to the apple at (1, 6). Continuing this direction also allows for an option to pivot towards (1,3) .\n2. **Right**: Moves us to (6, 6). This is a safe move and keeps us in a central position but doesn't provide immediate advantage.\n3. **Down**: Moves us to (5, 5). This move keeps us away from immediate apples (1,3),(1,6). Most optimal movement methodology would mitigate this approach initially as its away from central strategic approach.\n4. **Up**: Moves us to (5, 7). Future movements would prefer to steer in the proximity of apples considering our current safe position (5,6) relative proximity and movement analysis downstream.\n\n### Proximity and Strategic Move:\nProximity to apples is key. Moving Left keeps you close to multiple apples and minimizes risk of collision with the boundary, or with Snake #2 it also places you to have consistent movement trend avoiding collision especially on the left downward trend.\n\n### Strategy Next:\n- Moving Left continues to be a strategic move given overall proximity benefits , and safety all points considered.\nKeep paths clear avoiding the boulder created by proximity of the apple (0,2)\n\n### **Next Move** :\nInstead R I G H T"
