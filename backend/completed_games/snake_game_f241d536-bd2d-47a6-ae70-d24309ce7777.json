Now, I need to reassess the board and plan my next move.\n\nSince I'm at the edge of the board, I should move down to avoid the wall and create more space for myself. This will also give me a chance to look for other apples and potential threats from Snake #1.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that there's an apple at (6, 8) which is relatively close to me. I should aim to move towards it while keeping an eye on Snake #1.\n\nConsidering the position of Snake #1 at (2, 6) with body at [(1, 6), (1, 5)], it's still not an immediate threat to me, but I should be cautious.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I should continue moving down and then left to reach the apple at (6, 8). I'll need to keep an eye on Snake #1 and adjust my plan if necessary.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
