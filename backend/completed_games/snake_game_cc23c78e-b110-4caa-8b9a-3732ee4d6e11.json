The nearest apple is at (0, 6), which is directly above the current position. However, we must also consider the position of Snake #1, which is at (5, 8) and moving downwards. Since Snake #1 is far to the right, there is no immediate threat of collision with it by moving upwards.\n\nGiven the board state and the positions of the apples, the strategy remains to collect the apple at (0, 6) without deviating from the current path, as it is the safest and most straightforward move. After collecting this apple, the snake will have to consider new positions of apples and enemy snakes to plan the next moves.\n\nThe next move is: UP.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving up to (0, 2), I will be closer to the apple at (0, 6). I should continue to monitor the position of Snake #1 and adjust my path if it moves towards me. The next immediate goal will be to collect the apple at (0, 6) and then evaluate the new game state to decide where to move next. If Snake #1 continues to move downwards, it will be safe to continue moving upwards towards the apple. If Snake #1 changes direction, I will need to reassess the situation and potentially change my path to avoid a collision."

Then move RIGHT towards the apple at (2, 0).\n\nGiven the current board state and the strategy outlined above, the next move after collecting the apple at (0, 6) should be DOWN to (1, 6) to avoid the wall. This will position the snake to start moving right towards the next apple at (2, 0) while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #1.\n\nHowever, since the snake has just collected an apple and grown in length, it's crucial to ensure that the new segment does not block the snake's immediate path. In this case, moving down to (1, 6) is safe because the tail segment is at (3, 3), which does not obstruct the path downward.\n\nTherefore, the next move after collecting the apple at (0, 6) is: DOWN to (1, 6).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving down to (1, 6), begin moving right towards the apple at (2, 0), while continuously monitoring the position of Snake #1 to avoid any potential collisions. The goal is to safely navigate towards the apples while avoiding enemy snakes and the walls."
