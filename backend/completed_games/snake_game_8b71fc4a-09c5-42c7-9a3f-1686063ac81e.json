So our only options are UP (to (0,2)) or DOWN (to (0,0)).\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at:\n\u2022 (5,1) on row 1,\n\u2022 (7,0) on the bottom row,\n\u2022 (4,5) somewhere in the middle,\n\u2022 (1,8) near the top left,\n\u2022 (8,4) further right.\n\nThe apple at (5,1) would be ideal if we could approach it horizontally, but from (0,1) we can\u2019t immediately go right because of our own body. We must maneuver around.\n\nIf we move UP to (0,2), we\u2019ll be further from the bottom row where the apple at (7,0) is located, and our overall path would be a bit longer to eventually circle around toward that bottom apple. Moving DOWN, however, brings our head to (0,0), and from there we can start heading right. This opens up a relatively straightforward route along the bottom row toward the apple at (7,0) or even eventually redirect upward toward (5,1) once our tail vacates and the board opens.\n\nSince the board shows no immediate threats from the enemy snake (it\u2019s far off at (6,8)) and there are no obstacles in our path along the bottom, the safest and most efficient option is to start toward the bottom row. \n\nI\u2019ll choose: DOWN."

This gives us a clear point in our favor and leaves us flexible for future moves toward the other apples (like the one at (7,0)).\n\nDecided next move: UP."
