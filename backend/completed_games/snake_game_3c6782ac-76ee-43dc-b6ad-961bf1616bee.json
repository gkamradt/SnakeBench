            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling my snake, which is currently at (7, 1) on a 10x10 grid. I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me see the board state again. There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for my snake. Let me see... The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (7,3), which I think is somewhere in the lower middle part of the board. \n\nFirst, I should check where all the apples are located. The apples are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). The closest one to me is at (5,3). That's two units to the left on the x-axis, same y-coordinate as me. So, moving left from (7,3) would get me closer to that apple.\n\nWait, but my last move was UP, and I ended up at (7,3). Now, if I want to get to (5,3), I should probably move LEFT. That would take me to (6,3), then to (5,3). But I need to make sure that moving LEFT won't make me collide with any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. If I move left to (6,3), I'll run into Snake #2's head, which means I'll die. That's not good. So I can't move LEFT because it's blocked by the enemy.\n\nHmm, what other options do I have? Let's look around. My current position is (7,3). Up from here would be (7,4), which is another spot closer to the apple at (5,3) if I go left afterwards. But I need to make sure that (7,4) isn't occupied by another snake or a wall.\n\nWait, the board shows that at y=3, x=7, I'm there. If I go UP, y increases by 1 to 4. I don't see any apples at (7,4), but that's okay. What about Snake #2? It's at (6,3), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (7,2), but that's moving away from the apple at (5,3). Or RIGHT to (8,3), which is towards the edge of the board, but there's no apple that way. So moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to an apple.\n\nSo, moving UP seems like the safest bet. It takes me to (7,4), away from the enemy, and I can then maybe decide to move LEFT in the next steps to reach the apple at (5,3). But I should check if there's anything in the way at (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any apples or enemy snakes at (7,4), so moving there should be safe. Another consideration is whether moving UP will lead me into a wall or not. Since the board goes up to y=9, moving to y=4 is well within the boundaries.\n\nWait, but if I move UP to (7,4), I'm moving away from the apple at (5,3). Would that make it take longer to get there? Maybe, but I can't risk moving LEFT into the enemy. So perhaps I should take another route. Let me think: if I can't move LEFT because of the enemy, maybe I can move UP first and then go LEFT from there.\n\nBut from (7,4), moving LEFT to (6,4) might be possible. Is there an enemy or an apple there? Let me check the apples: (6,3) is the enemy, but (6,4) isn't an apple. So moving to (6,4) should be safe. Then, from (6,4), I can go LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3) to get the apple. But that's three moves, which seems a bit long, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT first to (8,3), but that doesn't help me get to the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,3) is straight to the left. If I move UP to (7,4), maybe I can go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me there in three moves without hitting the enemy.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe I should try moving DOWN to (7,2), but that's away from the apple. Or perhaps wait and see if the enemy moves away. But since I don't have information about the enemy's next move, I can't rely on that.\n\nAnother option: there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far away. Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me to the apple safely.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (8,3), then I'm moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So moving UP seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move UP to (7,4), will that put me in a position where I can go to (6,4) and then approach the apple from the top? Yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, I should also check if there are any other obstacles or apples in the path. The apples are only at the specified positions, so (6,4) is empty. So moving to (7,4) is safe.\n\nAdditionally, moving UP doesn't make me go out of bounds. The y-coordinate increases to 4, which is well within 0-9.\n\nSo, the plan is: move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), and finally DOWN to (5,3) to collect the apple. This way, I avoid the enemy at (6,3) and safely reach the apple.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes, as the enemy is at (6,3) and I'm moving away from it. So, moving UP is the best move now to proceed towards the apple without dying.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling my snake, which is currently at (7, 1) on a 10x10 grid. I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me see the board state again. There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right?

Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me to the apple safely.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (8,3), then I'm moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So moving UP seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move UP to (7,4), will that put me in a position where I can go to (6,4) and then approach the apple from the top? Yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, I should also check if there are any other obstacles or apples in the path. The apples are only at the specified positions, so (6,4) is empty. So moving to (7,4) is safe.\n\nAdditionally, moving UP doesn't make me go out of bounds. The y-coordinate increases to 4, which is well within 0-9.\n\nSo, the plan is: move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), and finally DOWN to (5,3) to collect the apple. This way, I avoid the enemy at (6,3) and safely reach the apple.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes, as the enemy is at (6,3) and I'm moving away from it. So, moving UP is the best move now to proceed towards the apple without dying.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling my snake, which is currently at (7, 1) on a 10x10 grid. I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me see the board state again. There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for my snake. Let me see... The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (7,3), which I think is somewhere in the lower middle part of the board. \n\nFirst, I should check where all the apples are located. The apples are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). The closest one to me is at (5,3). That's two units to the left on the x-axis, same y-coordinate as me. So, moving left from (7,3) would get me closer to that apple.\n\nWait, but my last move was UP, and I ended up at (7,3). Now, if I want to get to (5,3), I should probably move LEFT. That would take me to (6,3), then to (5,3). But I need to make sure that moving LEFT won't make me collide with any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. If I move left to (6,3), I'll run into Snake #2's head, which means I'll die. That's not good. So I can't move LEFT because it's blocked by the enemy.\n\nHmm, what other options do I have? Let's look around. My current position is (7,3). Up from here would be (7,4), which is another spot closer to the apple at (5,3) if I go left afterwards. But I need to make sure that (7,4) isn't occupied by another snake or a wall.\n\nWait, the board shows that at y=3, x=7, I'm there. If I go UP, y increases by 1 to 4. I don't see any apples at (7,4), but that's okay. What about Snake #2? It's at (6,3), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (7,2), but that's moving away from the apple at (5,3). Or RIGHT to (8,3), which is towards the edge of the board, but there's no apple that way. So moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to an apple.\n\nSo, moving UP seems like the safest bet. It takes me to (7,4), away from the enemy, and I can then maybe decide to move LEFT in the next steps to reach the apple at (5,3). But I should check if there's anything in the way at (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any apples or enemy snakes at (7,4), so moving there should be safe. Another consideration is whether moving UP will lead me into a wall or not. Since the board goes up to y=9, moving to y=4 is well within the boundaries.\n\nWait, but if I move UP to (7,4), I'm moving away from the apple at (5,3). Would that make it take longer to get there? Maybe, but I can't risk moving LEFT into the enemy. So perhaps I should take another route. Let me think: if I can't move LEFT because of the enemy, maybe I can move UP first and then go LEFT from there.\n\nBut from (7,4), moving LEFT to (6,4) might be possible. Is there an enemy or an apple there? Let me check the apples: (6,3) is the enemy, but (6,4) isn't an apple. So moving to (6,4) should be safe. Then, from (6,4), I can go LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3) to get the apple. But that's three moves, which seems a bit long, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT first to (8,3), but that doesn't help me get to the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,3) is straight to the left. If I move UP to (7,4), maybe I can go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me there in three moves without hitting the enemy.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe I should try moving DOWN to (7,2), but that's away from the apple. Or perhaps wait and see if the enemy moves away. But since I don't have information about the enemy's next move, I can't rely on that.\n\nAnother option: there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far away. Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3).

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (7,5) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). Enemy snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body segment at (5,3). Looking at the board, my snake is in the lower middle area, and there's an apple at (6,1) which is close. But first, I should check if moving towards that apple is possible without hitting anything.\n\nSince my last move was UP, which took me from (7,5) to where I am now, I need to decide the next direction. Wait, actually, the last move information says my snake is currently at (7,5), and the last move was UP. So I guess I just moved there. Now, looking at the board, I see that to reach the apple at (6,1), I need to move LEFT a few times and then DOWN. But I should check if there are any obstacles along the way.\n\nLooking at the enemy positions, snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I move LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), then to (5,5), and then I can go DOWN towards (5,4), (5,3) might be dangerous because that's where the enemy's body is. Hmm, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can move DOWN first to (7,4) and then LEFT towards (6,4), avoiding the enemy's position at (5,3).\n\nWait, the apple is at (6,1), which is further left and down from my current position. So maybe I should go LEFT to (6,5) next. But I have to make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to collide with anything. The board shows that at (6,5), there's nothing except maybe the enemy's body? Let me check the positions again. Enemy snake is at (5,2) with body at (5,3), so (6,5) is clear. So moving LEFT to (6,5) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,4) would give me a better path, but then I might have to navigate around more to reach the apple. But moving LEFT first seems more direct towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, another thought: moving LEFT to (6,5) and then moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), and so on down to (6,1) would put me in a straight line. But I have to check if any squares are blocked. Let me see the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) has my snake at (7,5). To the left, at (6,5), there's nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe. Then, from (6,5), moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and then (6,1) where the apple is. But wait, is (6,1) accessible? Let me check the board. Yes, (6,1) is an apple, so moving there is possible.\n\nBut wait, what about the enemy snake? The enemy is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I'm moving down along x=6, I don't cross enemy snake's path. Therefore, it's safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Move LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 safe.\n2. Then move DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) \u2013 all clear.\n3. Collect the apple at (6,1) and grow.\n\nAlternatively, I could check other apples, but (6,1) is the closest.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling my snake, which is currently at (7, 1) on a 10x10 grid. I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me see the board state again. There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for my snake. Let me see... The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (7,3), which I think is somewhere in the lower middle part of the board. \n\nFirst, I should check where all the apples are located. The apples are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). The closest one to me is at (5,3). That's two units to the left on the x-axis, same y-coordinate as me. So, moving left from (7,3) would get me closer to that apple.\n\nWait, but my last move was UP, and I ended up at (7,3). Now, if I want to get to (5,3), I should probably move LEFT. That would take me to (6,3), then to (5,3). But I need to make sure that moving LEFT won't make me collide with any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. If I move left to (6,3), I'll run into Snake #2's head, which means I'll die. That's not good. So I can't move LEFT because it's blocked by the enemy.\n\nHmm, what other options do I have? Let's look around. My current position is (7,3). Up from here would be (7,4), which is another spot closer to the apple at (5,3) if I go left afterwards. But I need to make sure that (7,4) isn't occupied by another snake or a wall.\n\nWait, the board shows that at y=3, x=7, I'm there. If I go UP, y increases by 1 to 4. I don't see any apples at (7,4), but that's okay. What about Snake #2? It's at (6,3), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (7,2), but that's moving away from the apple at (5,3). Or RIGHT to (8,3), which is towards the edge of the board, but there's no apple that way. So moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to an apple.\n\nSo, moving UP seems like the safest bet. It takes me to (7,4), away from the enemy, and I can then maybe decide to move LEFT in the next steps to reach the apple at (5,3). But I should check if there's anything in the way at (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any apples or enemy snakes at (7,4), so moving there should be safe. Another consideration is whether moving UP will lead me into a wall or not. Since the board goes up to y=9, moving to y=4 is well within the boundaries.\n\nWait, but if I move UP to (7,4), I'm moving away from the apple at (5,3). Would that make it take longer to get there? Maybe, but I can't risk moving LEFT into the enemy. So perhaps I should take another route. Let me think: if I can't move LEFT because of the enemy, maybe I can move UP first and then go LEFT from there.\n\nBut from (7,4), moving LEFT to (6,4) might be possible. Is there an enemy or an apple there? Let me check the apples: (6,3) is the enemy, but (6,4) isn't an apple. So moving to (6,4) should be safe. Then, from (6,4), I can go LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3) to get the apple. But that's three moves, which seems a bit long, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT first to (8,3), but that doesn't help me get to the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,3) is straight to the left. If I move UP to (7,4), maybe I can go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me there in three moves without hitting the enemy.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe I should try moving DOWN to (7,2), but that's away from the apple. Or perhaps wait and see if the enemy moves away. But since I don't have information about the enemy's next move, I can't rely on that.\n\nAnother option: there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far away. Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me to the apple safely.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (8,3), then I'm moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So moving UP seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move UP to (7,4), will that put me in a position where I can go to (6,4) and then approach the apple from the top? Yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, I should also check if there are any other obstacles or apples in the path. The apples are only at the specified positions, so (6,4) is empty. So moving to (7,4) is safe.\n\nAdditionally, moving UP doesn't make me go out of bounds. The y-coordinate increases to 4, which is well within 0-9.\n\nSo, the plan is: move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), and finally DOWN to (5,3) to collect the apple. This way, I avoid the enemy at (6,3) and safely reach the apple.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes, as the enemy is at (6,3) and I'm moving away from it. So, moving UP is the best move now to proceed towards the apple without dying.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (7,5) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). Enemy snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body segment at (5,3). Looking at the board, my snake is in the lower middle area, and there's an apple at (6,1) which is close. But first, I should check if moving towards that apple is possible without hitting anything.\n\nSince my last move was UP, which took me from (7,5) to where I am now, I need to decide the next direction. Wait, actually, the last move information says my snake is currently at (7,5), and the last move was UP. So I guess I just moved there. Now, looking at the board, I see that to reach the apple at (6,1), I need to move LEFT a few times and then DOWN. But I should check if there are any obstacles along the way.\n\nLooking at the enemy positions, snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I move LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), then to (5,5), and then I can go DOWN towards (5,4), (5,3) might be dangerous because that's where the enemy's body is. Hmm, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can move DOWN first to (7,4) and then LEFT towards (6,4), avoiding the enemy's position at (5,3).\n\nWait, the apple is at (6,1), which is further left and down from my current position. So maybe I should go LEFT to (6,5) next. But I have to make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to collide with anything. The board shows that at (6,5), there's nothing except maybe the enemy's body? Let me check the positions again. Enemy snake is at (5,2) with body at (5,3), so (6,5) is clear. So moving LEFT to (6,5) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,4) would give me a better path, but then I might have to navigate around more to reach the apple. But moving LEFT first seems more direct towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, another thought: moving LEFT to (6,5) and then moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), and so on down to (6,1) would put me in a straight line. But I have to check if any squares are blocked. Let me see the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) has my snake at (7,5). To the left, at (6,5), there's nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe. Then, from (6,5), moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and then (6,1) where the apple is. But wait, is (6,1) accessible? Let me check the board. Yes, (6,1) is an apple, so moving there is possible.\n\nBut wait, what about the enemy snake? The enemy is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I'm moving down along x=6, I don't cross enemy snake's path. Therefore, it's safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Move LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 safe.\n2. Then move DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) \u2013 all clear.\n3. Collect the apple at (6,1) and grow.\n\nAlternatively, I could check other apples, but (6,1) is the closest. So moving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nI think that's the strategy. So my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling my snake, which is currently at (7, 1) on a 10x10 grid. I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me see the board state again. There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for my snake. Let me see... The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (7,3), which I think is somewhere in the lower middle part of the board. \n\nFirst, I should check where all the apples are located. The apples are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). The closest one to me is at (5,3). That's two units to the left on the x-axis, same y-coordinate as me. So, moving left from (7,3) would get me closer to that apple.\n\nWait, but my last move was UP, and I ended up at (7,3). Now, if I want to get to (5,3), I should probably move LEFT. That would take me to (6,3), then to (5,3). But I need to make sure that moving LEFT won't make me collide with any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. If I move left to (6,3), I'll run into Snake #2's head, which means I'll die. That's not good. So I can't move LEFT because it's blocked by the enemy.\n\nHmm, what other options do I have? Let's look around. My current position is (7,3). Up from here would be (7,4), which is another spot closer to the apple at (5,3) if I go left afterwards. But I need to make sure that (7,4) isn't occupied by another snake or a wall.\n\nWait, the board shows that at y=3, x=7, I'm there. If I go UP, y increases by 1 to 4. I don't see any apples at (7,4), but that's okay. What about Snake #2? It's at (6,3), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (7,2), but that's moving away from the apple at (5,3). Or RIGHT to (8,3), which is towards the edge of the board, but there's no apple that way. So moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to an apple.\n\nSo, moving UP seems like the safest bet. It takes me to (7,4), away from the enemy, and I can then maybe decide to move LEFT in the next steps to reach the apple at (5,3). But I should check if there's anything in the way at (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any apples or enemy snakes at (7,4), so moving there should be safe. Another consideration is whether moving UP will lead me into a wall or not. Since the board goes up to y=9, moving to y=4 is well within the boundaries.\n\nWait, but if I move UP to (7,4), I'm moving away from the apple at (5,3). Would that make it take longer to get there? Maybe, but I can't risk moving LEFT into the enemy. So perhaps I should take another route. Let me think: if I can't move LEFT because of the enemy, maybe I can move UP first and then go LEFT from there.\n\nBut from (7,4), moving LEFT to (6,4) might be possible. Is there an enemy or an apple there? Let me check the apples: (6,3) is the enemy, but (6,4) isn't an apple. So moving to (6,4) should be safe. Then, from (6,4), I can go LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3) to get the apple. But that's three moves, which seems a bit long, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT first to (8,3), but that doesn't help me get to the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,3) is straight to the left. If I move UP to (7,4), maybe I can go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me there in three moves without hitting the enemy.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe I should try moving DOWN to (7,2), but that's away from the apple. Or perhaps wait and see if the enemy moves away. But since I don't have information about the enemy's next move, I can't rely on that.\n\nAnother option: there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far away. Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me to the apple safely.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (8,3), then I'm moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So moving UP seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move UP to (7,4), will that put me in a position where I can go to (6,4) and then approach the apple from the top? Yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, I should also check if there are any other obstacles or apples in the path. The apples are only at the specified positions, so (6,4) is empty. So moving to (7,4) is safe.\n\nAdditionally, moving UP doesn't make me go out of bounds. The y-coordinate increases to 4, which is well within 0-9.\n\nSo, the plan is: move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), and finally DOWN to (5,3) to collect the apple. This way, I avoid the enemy at (6,3) and safely reach the apple.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes, as the enemy is at (6,3) and I'm moving away from it. So, moving UP is the best move now to proceed towards the apple without dying.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (7,5) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). Enemy snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body segment at (5,3). Looking at the board, my snake is in the lower middle area, and there's an apple at (6,1) which is close. But first, I should check if moving towards that apple is possible without hitting anything.\n\nSince my last move was UP, which took me from (7,5) to where I am now, I need to decide the next direction. Wait, actually, the last move information says my snake is currently at (7,5), and the last move was UP. So I guess I just moved there. Now, looking at the board, I see that to reach the apple at (6,1), I need to move LEFT a few times and then DOWN. But I should check if there are any obstacles along the way.\n\nLooking at the enemy positions, snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I move LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), then to (5,5), and then I can go DOWN towards (5,4), (5,3) might be dangerous because that's where the enemy's body is. Hmm, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can move DOWN first to (7,4) and then LEFT towards (6,4), avoiding the enemy's position at (5,3).\n\nWait, the apple is at (6,1), which is further left and down from my current position. So maybe I should go LEFT to (6,5) next. But I have to make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to collide with anything. The board shows that at (6,5), there's nothing except maybe the enemy's body? Let me check the positions again. Enemy snake is at (5,2) with body at (5,3), so (6,5) is clear. So moving LEFT to (6,5) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,4) would give me a better path, but then I might have to navigate around more to reach the apple. But moving LEFT first seems more direct towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, another thought: moving LEFT to (6,5) and then moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), and so on down to (6,1) would put me in a straight line. But I have to check if any squares are blocked. Let me see the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) has my snake at (7,5). To the left, at (6,5), there's nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe. Then, from (6,5), moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and then (6,1) where the apple is. But wait, is (6,1) accessible? Let me check the board. Yes, (6,1) is an apple, so moving there is possible.\n\nBut wait, what about the enemy snake? The enemy is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I'm moving down along x=6, I don't cross enemy snake's path. Therefore, it's safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Move LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 safe.\n2. Then move DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) \u2013 all clear.\n3. Collect the apple at (6,1) and grow.\n\nAlternatively, I could check other apples, but (6,1) is the closest. So moving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nI think that's the strategy. So my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Also, I should make sure not to bump into my own tail, but since I'm moving straight down, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nSo, the strategy is to keep moving DOWN each turn until I reach (6,1) to collect that apple. After that, I'll reassess the situation to see which apple to go for next.\n\nTherefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling my snake, which is currently at (7, 1) on a 10x10 grid. I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me see the board state again. There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for my snake. Let me see... The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (7,3), which I think is somewhere in the lower middle part of the board. \n\nFirst, I should check where all the apples are located. The apples are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). The closest one to me is at (5,3). That's two units to the left on the x-axis, same y-coordinate as me. So, moving left from (7,3) would get me closer to that apple.\n\nWait, but my last move was UP, and I ended up at (7,3). Now, if I want to get to (5,3), I should probably move LEFT. That would take me to (6,3), then to (5,3). But I need to make sure that moving LEFT won't make me collide with any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. If I move left to (6,3), I'll run into Snake #2's head, which means I'll die. That's not good. So I can't move LEFT because it's blocked by the enemy.\n\nHmm, what other options do I have? Let's look around. My current position is (7,3). Up from here would be (7,4), which is another spot closer to the apple at (5,3) if I go left afterwards. But I need to make sure that (7,4) isn't occupied by another snake or a wall.\n\nWait, the board shows that at y=3, x=7, I'm there. If I go UP, y increases by 1 to 4. I don't see any apples at (7,4), but that's okay. What about Snake #2? It's at (6,3), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (7,2), but that's moving away from the apple at (5,3). Or RIGHT to (8,3), which is towards the edge of the board, but there's no apple that way. So moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to an apple.\n\nSo, moving UP seems like the safest bet. It takes me to (7,4), away from the enemy, and I can then maybe decide to move LEFT in the next steps to reach the apple at (5,3). But I should check if there's anything in the way at (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any apples or enemy snakes at (7,4), so moving there should be safe. Another consideration is whether moving UP will lead me into a wall or not. Since the board goes up to y=9, moving to y=4 is well within the boundaries.\n\nWait, but if I move UP to (7,4), I'm moving away from the apple at (5,3). Would that make it take longer to get there? Maybe, but I can't risk moving LEFT into the enemy. So perhaps I should take another route. Let me think: if I can't move LEFT because of the enemy, maybe I can move UP first and then go LEFT from there.\n\nBut from (7,4), moving LEFT to (6,4) might be possible. Is there an enemy or an apple there? Let me check the apples: (6,3) is the enemy, but (6,4) isn't an apple. So moving to (6,4) should be safe. Then, from (6,4), I can go LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3) to get the apple. But that's three moves, which seems a bit long, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT first to (8,3), but that doesn't help me get to the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,3) is straight to the left. If I move UP to (7,4), maybe I can go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me there in three moves without hitting the enemy.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe I should try moving DOWN to (7,2), but that's away from the apple. Or perhaps wait and see if the enemy moves away. But since I don't have information about the enemy's next move, I can't rely on that.\n\nAnother option: there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far away. Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me to the apple safely.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (8,3), then I'm moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So moving UP seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move UP to (7,4), will that put me in a position where I can go to (6,4) and then approach the apple from the top? Yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, I should also check if there are any other obstacles or apples in the path. The apples are only at the specified positions, so (6,4) is empty. So moving to (7,4) is safe.\n\nAdditionally, moving UP doesn't make me go out of bounds. The y-coordinate increases to 4, which is well within 0-9.\n\nSo, the plan is: move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), and finally DOWN to (5,3) to collect the apple. This way, I avoid the enemy at (6,3) and safely reach the apple.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes, as the enemy is at (6,3) and I'm moving away from it. So, moving UP is the best move now to proceed towards the apple without dying.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (7,5) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). Enemy snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body segment at (5,3). Looking at the board, my snake is in the lower middle area, and there's an apple at (6,1) which is close. But first, I should check if moving towards that apple is possible without hitting anything.\n\nSince my last move was UP, which took me from (7,5) to where I am now, I need to decide the next direction. Wait, actually, the last move information says my snake is currently at (7,5), and the last move was UP. So I guess I just moved there. Now, looking at the board, I see that to reach the apple at (6,1), I need to move LEFT a few times and then DOWN. But I should check if there are any obstacles along the way.\n\nLooking at the enemy positions, snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I move LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), then to (5,5), and then I can go DOWN towards (5,4), (5,3) might be dangerous because that's where the enemy's body is. Hmm, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can move DOWN first to (7,4) and then LEFT towards (6,4), avoiding the enemy's position at (5,3).\n\nWait, the apple is at (6,1), which is further left and down from my current position. So maybe I should go LEFT to (6,5) next. But I have to make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to collide with anything. The board shows that at (6,5), there's nothing except maybe the enemy's body? Let me check the positions again. Enemy snake is at (5,2) with body at (5,3), so (6,5) is clear. So moving LEFT to (6,5) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,4) would give me a better path, but then I might have to navigate around more to reach the apple. But moving LEFT first seems more direct towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, another thought: moving LEFT to (6,5) and then moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), and so on down to (6,1) would put me in a straight line. But I have to check if any squares are blocked. Let me see the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) has my snake at (7,5). To the left, at (6,5), there's nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe. Then, from (6,5), moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and then (6,1) where the apple is. But wait, is (6,1) accessible? Let me check the board. Yes, (6,1) is an apple, so moving there is possible.\n\nBut wait, what about the enemy snake? The enemy is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I'm moving down along x=6, I don't cross enemy snake's path. Therefore, it's safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Move LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 safe.\n2. Then move DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) \u2013 all clear.\n3. Collect the apple at (6,1) and grow.\n\nAlternatively, I could check other apples, but (6,1) is the closest. So moving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nI think that's the strategy. So my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling my snake, which is currently at (7, 1) on a 10x10 grid. I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me see the board state again. There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for my snake. Let me see... The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (7,3), which I think is somewhere in the lower middle part of the board. \n\nFirst, I should check where all the apples are located. The apples are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). The closest one to me is at (5,3). That's two units to the left on the x-axis, same y-coordinate as me. So, moving left from (7,3) would get me closer to that apple.\n\nWait, but my last move was UP, and I ended up at (7,3). Now, if I want to get to (5,3), I should probably move LEFT. That would take me to (6,3), then to (5,3). But I need to make sure that moving LEFT won't make me collide with any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. If I move left to (6,3), I'll run into Snake #2's head, which means I'll die. That's not good. So I can't move LEFT because it's blocked by the enemy.\n\nHmm, what other options do I have? Let's look around. My current position is (7,3). Up from here would be (7,4), which is another spot closer to the apple at (5,3) if I go left afterwards. But I need to make sure that (7,4) isn't occupied by another snake or a wall.\n\nWait, the board shows that at y=3, x=7, I'm there. If I go UP, y increases by 1 to 4. I don't see any apples at (7,4), but that's okay. What about Snake #2? It's at (6,3), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (7,2), but that's moving away from the apple at (5,3). Or RIGHT to (8,3), which is towards the edge of the board, but there's no apple that way. So moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to an apple.\n\nSo, moving UP seems like the safest bet. It takes me to (7,4), away from the enemy, and I can then maybe decide to move LEFT in the next steps to reach the apple at (5,3). But I should check if there's anything in the way at (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any apples or enemy snakes at (7,4), so moving there should be safe. Another consideration is whether moving UP will lead me into a wall or not. Since the board goes up to y=9, moving to y=4 is well within the boundaries.\n\nWait, but if I move UP to (7,4), I'm moving away from the apple at (5,3). Would that make it take longer to get there? Maybe, but I can't risk moving LEFT into the enemy. So perhaps I should take another route. Let me think: if I can't move LEFT because of the enemy, maybe I can move UP first and then go LEFT from there.\n\nBut from (7,4), moving LEFT to (6,4) might be possible. Is there an enemy or an apple there? Let me check the apples: (6,3) is the enemy, but (6,4) isn't an apple. So moving to (6,4) should be safe. Then, from (6,4), I can go LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3) to get the apple. But that's three moves, which seems a bit long, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT first to (8,3), but that doesn't help me get to the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,3) is straight to the left. If I move UP to (7,4), maybe I can go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me there in three moves without hitting the enemy.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe I should try moving DOWN to (7,2), but that's away from the apple. Or perhaps wait and see if the enemy moves away. But since I don't have information about the enemy's next move, I can't rely on that.\n\nAnother option: there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far away. Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me to the apple safely.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (8,3), then I'm moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So moving UP seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move UP to (7,4), will that put me in a position where I can go to (6,4) and then approach the apple from the top? Yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, I should also check if there are any other obstacles or apples in the path. The apples are only at the specified positions, so (6,4) is empty. So moving to (7,4) is safe.\n\nAdditionally, moving UP doesn't make me go out of bounds. The y-coordinate increases to 4, which is well within 0-9.\n\nSo, the plan is: move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), and finally DOWN to (5,3) to collect the apple. This way, I avoid the enemy at (6,3) and safely reach the apple.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes, as the enemy is at (6,3) and I'm moving away from it. So, moving UP is the best move now to proceed towards the apple without dying.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (7,5) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). Enemy snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body segment at (5,3). Looking at the board, my snake is in the lower middle area, and there's an apple at (6,1) which is close. But first, I should check if moving towards that apple is possible without hitting anything.\n\nSince my last move was UP, which took me from (7,5) to where I am now, I need to decide the next direction. Wait, actually, the last move information says my snake is currently at (7,5), and the last move was UP. So I guess I just moved there. Now, looking at the board, I see that to reach the apple at (6,1), I need to move LEFT a few times and then DOWN. But I should check if there are any obstacles along the way.\n\nLooking at the enemy positions, snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I move LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), then to (5,5), and then I can go DOWN towards (5,4), (5,3) might be dangerous because that's where the enemy's body is. Hmm, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can move DOWN first to (7,4) and then LEFT towards (6,4), avoiding the enemy's position at (5,3).\n\nWait, the apple is at (6,1), which is further left and down from my current position. So maybe I should go LEFT to (6,5) next. But I have to make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to collide with anything. The board shows that at (6,5), there's nothing except maybe the enemy's body? Let me check the positions again. Enemy snake is at (5,2) with body at (5,3), so (6,5) is clear. So moving LEFT to (6,5) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,4) would give me a better path, but then I might have to navigate around more to reach the apple. But moving LEFT first seems more direct towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, another thought: moving LEFT to (6,5) and then moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), and so on down to (6,1) would put me in a straight line. But I have to check if any squares are blocked. Let me see the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) has my snake at (7,5). To the left, at (6,5), there's nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe. Then, from (6,5), moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and then (6,1) where the apple is. But wait, is (6,1) accessible? Let me check the board. Yes, (6,1) is an apple, so moving there is possible.\n\nBut wait, what about the enemy snake? The enemy is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I'm moving down along x=6, I don't cross enemy snake's path. Therefore, it's safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Move LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 safe.\n2. Then move DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) \u2013 all clear.\n3. Collect the apple at (6,1) and grow.\n\nAlternatively, I could check other apples, but (6,1) is the closest. So moving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nI think that's the strategy. So my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The closest apple to me is at (6,1), which is to the left and down from my current position.\n\nI'm thinking about how to reach that apple. The board shows that moving LEFT to (6,5) is possible because there's nothing blocking that spot. Once I'm at (6,5), I can start moving DOWN towards (6,1). I should check if any squares along the way are blocked or have other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy positions, snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So, if I move DOWN from (6,5) towards (6,1), I don't cross their path. That seems safe.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any other obstacles or if moving in a different direction might be better. For example, moving DOWN first to (7,4) and then LEFT to (6,4) might give me another path, but that seems less direct. I think moving LEFT first is the most straightforward way.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure I don't get stuck in a corner or run into myself. Since my snake's body is only at (7,5) right now, moving LEFT doesn't cause any immediate collision.\n\nSo, the plan is to move LEFT to (6,5), then continue DOWN to reach the apple at (6,1).\n\nAnother thought: maybe after getting the apple, I can go for another nearby apple, but that's for the next move. For now, focusing on getting to (6,1) is the priority.\n\nI think I'm ready to decide the next move.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

But upon checking the board, I realize that I must have made a mistake because moving DOWN from (6,4) would take me towards (6,3), which is indeed closer to the apple. However, the enemy snake is at (5,2), and moving DOWN towards (6,3) doesn't directly interfere with that.\n\nWait, maybe I got confused with the directions. Let me clarify: my snake is at (6,4). Moving DOWN would decrease the y-coordinate, taking me to (6,3), then DOWN again to (6,2), and finally (6,1). That's correct. So, moving DOWN seems the right choice to reach the apple.\n\nBut perhaps I got distracted and thought I was moving in the opposite direction. It's important to keep track of the coordinates correctly. So, moving DOWN from (6,4) is the next logical step towards the apple. I should stick to that plan.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (6,3), keeping me on the path to the apple at (6,1). No other snakes are in my immediate path, so it's safe for now.\n\nWait, but according to the user's last action, they had moved DOWN to (6,4) and were thinking to continue DOWN. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The correct next move is indeed DOWN to (6,3).\n\nBut looking back, I think the initial plan was to go DOWN, so moving DOWN again makes sense. I shouldn't second-guess myself here. It's better to stay focused on reaching the apple without any obstacles in the way.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll move DOWN to (6,3) to continue towards the apple at (6,1).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling my snake, which is currently at (7, 1) on a 10x10 grid. I'm trying to figure out my next move. Let me see the board state again. There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for my snake. Let me see... The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (7,3), which I think is somewhere in the lower middle part of the board. \n\nFirst, I should check where all the apples are located. The apples are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). The closest one to me is at (5,3). That's two units to the left on the x-axis, same y-coordinate as me. So, moving left from (7,3) would get me closer to that apple.\n\nWait, but my last move was UP, and I ended up at (7,3). Now, if I want to get to (5,3), I should probably move LEFT. That would take me to (6,3), then to (5,3). But I need to make sure that moving LEFT won't make me collide with any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. If I move left to (6,3), I'll run into Snake #2's head, which means I'll die. That's not good. So I can't move LEFT because it's blocked by the enemy.\n\nHmm, what other options do I have? Let's look around. My current position is (7,3). Up from here would be (7,4), which is another spot closer to the apple at (5,3) if I go left afterwards. But I need to make sure that (7,4) isn't occupied by another snake or a wall.\n\nWait, the board shows that at y=3, x=7, I'm there. If I go UP, y increases by 1 to 4. I don't see any apples at (7,4), but that's okay. What about Snake #2? It's at (6,3), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (7,2), but that's moving away from the apple at (5,3). Or RIGHT to (8,3), which is towards the edge of the board, but there's no apple that way. So moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to an apple.\n\nSo, moving UP seems like the safest bet. It takes me to (7,4), away from the enemy, and I can then maybe decide to move LEFT in the next steps to reach the apple at (5,3). But I should check if there's anything in the way at (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any apples or enemy snakes at (7,4), so moving there should be safe. Another consideration is whether moving UP will lead me into a wall or not. Since the board goes up to y=9, moving to y=4 is well within the boundaries.\n\nWait, but if I move UP to (7,4), I'm moving away from the apple at (5,3). Would that make it take longer to get there? Maybe, but I can't risk moving LEFT into the enemy. So perhaps I should take another route. Let me think: if I can't move LEFT because of the enemy, maybe I can move UP first and then go LEFT from there.\n\nBut from (7,4), moving LEFT to (6,4) might be possible. Is there an enemy or an apple there? Let me check the apples: (6,3) is the enemy, but (6,4) isn't an apple. So moving to (6,4) should be safe. Then, from (6,4), I can go LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3) to get the apple. But that's three moves, which seems a bit long, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT first to (8,3), but that doesn't help me get to the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,3) is straight to the left. If I move UP to (7,4), maybe I can go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me there in three moves without hitting the enemy.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe I should try moving DOWN to (7,2), but that's away from the apple. Or perhaps wait and see if the enemy moves away. But since I don't have information about the enemy's next move, I can't rely on that.\n\nAnother option: there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far away. Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me to the apple safely.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (8,3), then I'm moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So moving UP seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move UP to (7,4), will that put me in a position where I can go to (6,4) and then approach the apple from the top? Yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, I should also check if there are any other obstacles or apples in the path. The apples are only at the specified positions, so (6,4) is empty. So moving to (7,4) is safe.\n\nAdditionally, moving UP doesn't make me go out of bounds. The y-coordinate increases to 4, which is well within 0-9.\n\nSo, the plan is: move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), and finally DOWN to (5,3) to collect the apple. This way, I avoid the enemy at (6,3) and safely reach the apple.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes, as the enemy is at (6,3) and I'm moving away from it. So, moving UP is the best move now to proceed towards the apple without dying.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (7,5) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). Enemy snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body segment at (5,3). Looking at the board, my snake is in the lower middle area, and there's an apple at (6,1) which is close. But first, I should check if moving towards that apple is possible without hitting anything.\n\nSince my last move was UP, which took me from (7,5) to where I am now, I need to decide the next direction. Wait, actually, the last move information says my snake is currently at (7,5), and the last move was UP. So I guess I just moved there. Now, looking at the board, I see that to reach the apple at (6,1), I need to move LEFT a few times and then DOWN. But I should check if there are any obstacles along the way.\n\nLooking at the enemy positions, snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I move LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), then to (5,5), and then I can go DOWN towards (5,4), (5,3) might be dangerous because that's where the enemy's body is. Hmm, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can move DOWN first to (7,4) and then LEFT towards (6,4), avoiding the enemy's position at (5,3).\n\nWait, the apple is at (6,1), which is further left and down from my current position. So maybe I should go LEFT to (6,5) next. But I have to make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to collide with anything. The board shows that at (6,5), there's nothing except maybe the enemy's body? Let me check the positions again. Enemy snake is at (5,2) with body at (5,3), so (6,5) is clear. So moving LEFT to (6,5) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,4) would give me a better path, but then I might have to navigate around more to reach the apple. But moving LEFT first seems more direct towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, another thought: moving LEFT to (6,5) and then moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), and so on down to (6,1) would put me in a straight line. But I have to check if any squares are blocked. Let me see the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) has my snake at (7,5). To the left, at (6,5), there's nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe. Then, from (6,5), moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and then (6,1) where the apple is. But wait, is (6,1) accessible? Let me check the board. Yes, (6,1) is an apple, so moving there is possible.\n\nBut wait, what about the enemy snake? The enemy is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I'm moving down along x=6, I don't cross enemy snake's path. Therefore, it's safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Move LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 safe.\n2. Then move DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) \u2013 all clear.\n3. Collect the apple at (6,1) and grow.\n\nAlternatively, I could check other apples, but (6,1) is the closest. So moving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nI think that's the strategy. So my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

However, the enemy snake is at (5,2), and moving DOWN towards (6,3) doesn't directly interfere with that.\n\nWait, maybe I got confused with the directions. Let me clarify: my snake is at (6,4). Moving DOWN would decrease the y-coordinate, taking me to (6,3), then DOWN again to (6,2), and finally (6,1). That's correct. So, moving DOWN seems the right choice to reach the apple.\n\nBut perhaps I got distracted and thought I was moving in the opposite direction. It's important to keep track of the coordinates correctly. So, moving DOWN from (6,4) is the next logical step towards the apple. I should stick to that plan.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (6,3), keeping me on the path to the apple at (6,1).

There are several apples located at (5,3), (7,3), (9,8), (0,6), and (1,7). Also, there's another snake, Snake #2, at position (6,5). My goal is to collect an apple to grow and gain points without running into any walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess where I am. My snake is at (7,1). The apples are at various positions, but the closest ones seem to be either (5,3) or (7,3). Also, I should remember that Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is a bit to the left and up from my current position.\n\nI think my best move is to head towards the nearest apple. Let's calculate the distances. From (7,1) to (5,3): the x coordinate difference is 2 units left, and y is 2 units up. That's a total of 4 units. To (7,3), it's only 2 units up, same x. That seems closer. So (7,3) is directly above me, two spaces up.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure moving up doesn't make me run into anything. The upper direction from (7,1) is y increasing. Each move up would take me to (7,2) and then (7,3). I should check if there's any obstruction between me and that apple. The board doesn't show any walls or other snakes in that path except for the enemy at (6,5), which is at x=6, y=5. So if I go straight up, I should reach (7,3) without issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving towards (5,3), but that would require moving left and up, which is a bit further. Also, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into Snake #2, which is at (6,5). If I go left, my x would decrease, but Snake #2 is at x=6, so unless I'm moving towards that, it's probably not an immediate threat.\n\nWait, my current position is (7,1). If I move up twice, I can reach (7,3). Let me check the possible path. At each step, moving up would go to (7,2) first. I don't see any apples or snakes in that position. Then, from (7,2) to (7,3), which is where the apple is. That seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (7,3) might put me in a position where I could block myself or run into my own body in the future. But since this is the first move, my snake's body is only at (7,1), so moving to (7,3) shouldn't cause any issues.\n\nI should also look at other possible directions. What about right? Moving right from (7,1) would take me to (8,1) and then (9,1). But I don't see an apple nearby in that direction. The next closest apple is at (9,8), which is way up, so that's probably too far. Plus, moving right would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nMoving down from (7,1) would take me to (7,0), which is the bottom edge. That's a corner, but I don't see any apples there. Plus, moving down would mean I'm moving away from the apple at (7,3).\n\nMoving left from (7,1) would take me to (6,1) next. But I should check if that's near any enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at (6,5), which is at y=5, so moving left to (6,1) is safe, but then what? The apple at (5,3) is two left and three up from (6,1). Hmm, that's a bit of a detour, but maybe possible. Alternatively, I could go left once to (6,1) and then up towards the apple, but that might take more moves and I might not get there before the enemy does.\n\nBut wait, the enemy is at (6,5), so if I move left to (6,1), I'm below the enemy. If I then move up, I might run into the enemy if they move down, but I don't know their movement. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the same apple at (5,3) or another one.\n\nAnother thought: if I go straight up to (7,3), I can eat that apple and grow, giving me an advantage. Then, I can look for another apple. But I should make sure that moving up doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can block me or where I might hit the wall.\n\nLet me visualize the board again. From (7,1) moving up to (7,3). No one is in that path. So that's two moves up. So my next move should be UP, then another UP in the following turn. That would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but each turn, I can only move once. So my next move would be UP to (7,2), and then in the following turn, another UP to (7,3). So the immediate next move is UP.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the position of Snake #2 at (6,5). If I go up to (7,3), I'm moving into the same column as Snake #2 is, but since they're at y=5, and I'm at y=3, there's a buffer. Unless they move down, which I can't predict, but I have to assume they might move towards the nearest apple too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize moving towards a different apple to avoid potential competition. The apple at (5,3) is also nearby. So perhaps moving left to (6,1) and then up towards (5,3). Let's see: from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then left again to (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3). That's four moves, but I don't know if that's better than moving up to (7,3) in two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving up twice to (7,3) seems quicker. So I think the best move is to move UP first.\n\nAnother consideration: when I eat the apple at (7,3), I'll grow, which means my snake's body will extend. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally run into my own body in the next moves, but since I'm only moving straight up, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving UP to (7,2) is the next move. That gets me closer to the apple at (7,3). In the next turn, I can move up again to eat the apple. I should also keep an eye on Snake #2's position in case they move towards the same apple, but I think I can reach it first if I move towards it now.\n</think>\n\nNext, I move UP towards the apple at (7,3). \n\n**Direction: UP**"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the best next move for my snake. Let me see... The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (7,3), which I think is somewhere in the lower middle part of the board. \n\nFirst, I should check where all the apples are located. The apples are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). The closest one to me is at (5,3). That's two units to the left on the x-axis, same y-coordinate as me. So, moving left from (7,3) would get me closer to that apple.\n\nWait, but my last move was UP, and I ended up at (7,3). Now, if I want to get to (5,3), I should probably move LEFT. That would take me to (6,3), then to (5,3). But I need to make sure that moving LEFT won't make me collide with any walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. If I move left to (6,3), I'll run into Snake #2's head, which means I'll die. That's not good. So I can't move LEFT because it's blocked by the enemy.\n\nHmm, what other options do I have? Let's look around. My current position is (7,3). Up from here would be (7,4), which is another spot closer to the apple at (5,3) if I go left afterwards. But I need to make sure that (7,4) isn't occupied by another snake or a wall.\n\nWait, the board shows that at y=3, x=7, I'm there. If I go UP, y increases by 1 to 4. I don't see any apples at (7,4), but that's okay. What about Snake #2? It's at (6,3), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (7,2), but that's moving away from the apple at (5,3). Or RIGHT to (8,3), which is towards the edge of the board, but there's no apple that way. So moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to an apple.\n\nSo, moving UP seems like the safest bet. It takes me to (7,4), away from the enemy, and I can then maybe decide to move LEFT in the next steps to reach the apple at (5,3). But I should check if there's anything in the way at (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any apples or enemy snakes at (7,4), so moving there should be safe. Another consideration is whether moving UP will lead me into a wall or not. Since the board goes up to y=9, moving to y=4 is well within the boundaries.\n\nWait, but if I move UP to (7,4), I'm moving away from the apple at (5,3). Would that make it take longer to get there? Maybe, but I can't risk moving LEFT into the enemy. So perhaps I should take another route. Let me think: if I can't move LEFT because of the enemy, maybe I can move UP first and then go LEFT from there.\n\nBut from (7,4), moving LEFT to (6,4) might be possible. Is there an enemy or an apple there? Let me check the apples: (6,3) is the enemy, but (6,4) isn't an apple. So moving to (6,4) should be safe. Then, from (6,4), I can go LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3) to get the apple. But that's three moves, which seems a bit long, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go RIGHT first to (8,3), but that doesn't help me get to the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (5,3) is straight to the left. If I move UP to (7,4), maybe I can go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT again to (5,4), and then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me there in three moves without hitting the enemy.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe I should try moving DOWN to (7,2), but that's away from the apple. Or perhaps wait and see if the enemy moves away. But since I don't have information about the enemy's next move, I can't rely on that.\n\nAnother option: there's an apple at (9,8), but that's far away. Also, an apple at (0,6), which is on the opposite side of the board. So the closest apples are (5,3) and (6,3), but (6,3) is the enemy's head, so I shouldn't go there.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,3) is actually the enemy's position. So that's not an apple I can collect; it's the enemy's head. So the apples I can go for are at (5,3), (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), and (2,5). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nBut how do I get to (5,3) without hitting the enemy at (6,3)? Maybe I can go around. From (7,3), move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then DOWN to (5,3). That would get me to the apple safely.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (8,3), then I'm moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So moving UP seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move UP to (7,4), will that put me in a position where I can go to (6,4) and then approach the apple from the top? Yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, I should also check if there are any other obstacles or apples in the path. The apples are only at the specified positions, so (6,4) is empty. So moving to (7,4) is safe.\n\nAdditionally, moving UP doesn't make me go out of bounds. The y-coordinate increases to 4, which is well within 0-9.\n\nSo, the plan is: move UP to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), and finally DOWN to (5,3) to collect the apple. This way, I avoid the enemy at (6,3) and safely reach the apple.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats from other snakes, as the enemy is at (6,3) and I'm moving away from it. So, moving UP is the best move now to proceed towards the apple without dying.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (7,5) on a 10x10 grid. The apples are located at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). Enemy snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body segment at (5,3). Looking at the board, my snake is in the lower middle area, and there's an apple at (6,1) which is close. But first, I should check if moving towards that apple is possible without hitting anything.\n\nSince my last move was UP, which took me from (7,5) to where I am now, I need to decide the next direction. Wait, actually, the last move information says my snake is currently at (7,5), and the last move was UP. So I guess I just moved there. Now, looking at the board, I see that to reach the apple at (6,1), I need to move LEFT a few times and then DOWN. But I should check if there are any obstacles along the way.\n\nLooking at the enemy positions, snake #2 is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I move LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), then to (5,5), and then I can go DOWN towards (5,4), (5,3) might be dangerous because that's where the enemy's body is. Hmm, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can move DOWN first to (7,4) and then LEFT towards (6,4), avoiding the enemy's position at (5,3).\n\nWait, the apple is at (6,1), which is further left and down from my current position. So maybe I should go LEFT to (6,5) next. But I have to make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to collide with anything. The board shows that at (6,5), there's nothing except maybe the enemy's body? Let me check the positions again. Enemy snake is at (5,2) with body at (5,3), so (6,5) is clear. So moving LEFT to (6,5) seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,4) would give me a better path, but then I might have to navigate around more to reach the apple. But moving LEFT first seems more direct towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nWait, another thought: moving LEFT to (6,5) and then moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), and so on down to (6,1) would put me in a straight line. But I have to check if any squares are blocked. Let me see the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5 (y=5) has my snake at (7,5). To the left, at (6,5), there's nothing. So moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe. Then, from (6,5), moving DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and then (6,1) where the apple is. But wait, is (6,1) accessible? Let me check the board. Yes, (6,1) is an apple, so moving there is possible.\n\nBut wait, what about the enemy snake? The enemy is at (5,2) with a body at (5,3). So if I'm moving down along x=6, I don't cross enemy snake's path. Therefore, it's safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Move LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 safe.\n2. Then move DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) \u2013 all clear.\n3. Collect the apple at (6,1) and grow.\n\nAlternatively, I could check other apples, but (6,1) is the closest. So moving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nI think that's the strategy. So my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, I'm the snake at position (6,4), and my next move is UP to (6,5). Let me think through why I'm making this move.\n\nSo, I had previously decided to go DOWN towards the apple at (6,1), moving from (6,4) to (6,3). But upon checking the board, I realize that I must have made a mistake because moving DOWN from (6,4) would take me towards (6,3), which is indeed closer to the apple. However, the enemy snake is at (5,2), and moving DOWN towards (6,3) doesn't directly interfere with that.\n\nWait, maybe I got confused with the directions. Let me clarify: my snake is at (6,4). Moving DOWN would decrease the y-coordinate, taking me to (6,3), then DOWN again to (6,2), and finally (6,1). That's correct. So, moving DOWN seems the right choice to reach the apple.\n\nBut perhaps I got distracted and thought I was moving in the opposite direction. It's important to keep track of the coordinates correctly. So, moving DOWN from (6,4) is the next logical step towards the apple. I should stick to that plan.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be DOWN to (6,3), keeping me on the path to the apple at (6,1). No other snakes are in my immediate path, so it's safe for now.\n\nWait, but according to the user's last action, they had moved DOWN to (6,4) and were thinking to continue DOWN. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The correct next move is indeed DOWN to (6,3).\n\nBut looking back, I think the initial plan was to go DOWN, so moving DOWN again makes sense. I shouldn't second-guess myself here. It's better to stay focused on reaching the apple without any obstacles in the way.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll move DOWN to (6,3) to continue towards the apple at (6,1).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

I could move UP again, which would bring me closer to the apple, but also closer to Snake #1's body at (5, 4).\n\nHowever, I think I'll play it safe and move RIGHT instead. This will bring me closer to the center of the board and give me more options for my next move. I'll still be moving towards the apple, but I'll be doing it in a way that keeps me safe from Snake #1 and the edge of the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue to move towards the apple at (2, 5) while keeping an eye on Snake #1 and avoiding potential dangers.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game and my snake is currently at position (5,2). The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself. The apples are located at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the board state. Looking at the positions, the closest apple to my current location is at (6,1). That seems like a good target because it's relatively nearby. Let me plot the path from (5,2) to (6,1). \n\nSo, from (5,2), moving right would take me to (6,2), and then down to (6,1). That's just two moves: RIGHT and then DOWN. Alternatively, I could move DOWN first to (5,1) and then RIGHT twice to (6,1), but that would take more moves. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles along the way.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes, Snake #2 is at (4,2) with a body at (3,2). So, if I move RIGHT to (6,2), I should be clear because Snake #2 is at (4,2), which is two units to the left of my current position, so moving RIGHT should be safe. \n\nAnother idea is to check if there are any other apples closer, but I think (6,1) is the closest. The apple at (2,5) is too far, and the others are either on the other side of the board or not as close.\n\nAlso, I should consider growing my snake by eating the apple. If I reach (6,1), I'll grow longer, which might help block the enemy snake or protect myself.\n\nSo, the plan is to move RIGHT to (6,2) and then DOWN to (6,1). Let's check for any potential threats. Are there any walls? No, because (6,1) is within the 10x10 grid. Are there any enemy snakes in the path? The only enemy is at (4,2), so moving RIGHT to (6,2) doesn't interfere with that.\n\nWait, actually, moving from (5,2) to (6,2) is a valid move. Then from (6,2) to (6,1) is DOWN. That seems clear. I don't see any immediate threats, so this should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if moving UP would get me closer to another apple, but moving UP from (5,2) to (5,3) doesn't seem helpful because the apple at (2,5) is still far. Moving LEFT from (5,2) takes me towards (4,2) where Snake #2 is, which could be dangerous, so it's better to avoid that.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is the best option, followed by DOWN to (6,1) to collect the apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll reassess the board to see which apple to go for next, but for now, RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm starting at position (6,2) after my last move. Let me check the board again. The apples are at (9,8), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), and (6,1). I just ate the apple at (6,1) last time, so that's gone now. My snake has grown a bit, so I need to make sure I don't run into myself.\n\nLooking at the board, the next closest apple is probably at (2,5). Let me see the positions. From (6,1), moving towards (2,5) would require going left and up. So I'd have to move LEFT several times and then UP. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nWait, enemy Snake #2 was at (4,3) with a body at (4,2). So if I start moving LEFT from (6,1), I'd go to (5,1), then (4,1), then (3,1), etc. I don't think Snake #2 is in that path, so that's probably safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,7). That's further away, but it might be safer. Let me calculate the distance. From (6,1) to (1,7) is a big move. I'd have to go LEFT 5 times and UP 6 times, which is a lot. But maybe it's worth it because that apple is still available.\n\nWait, another idea: the apple at (0,6). That's pretty far as well, but perhaps I can head that way after getting closer. For now, maybe the closest is (2,5). Let me plan the path.\n\nFrom (6,1), moving LEFT to (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), then UP to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). That seems doable. But wait, is there any enemy snake in that path? Snake #2 is at (4,3), so when I'm at (4,1), moving up from there to (4,2) and (4,3) would be dangerous. So I should avoid moving up through that area.\n\nAlternatively, after moving to (4,1), I can go UP to (4,2), but Snake #2's body is at (4,2), which would cause me to die. So I should find another way.\n\nMaybe I can go around. From (6,1), move UP to (6,2), then LEFT to (5,2), (4,2) is dangerous, so maybe go around another way. Or perhaps take a different route.\n\nWait, maybe instead of going straight LEFT from (6,1), I can first move UP to (6,2), then LEFT to (5,2), and then see if I can go around Snake #2.\n\nBut Snake #2 is at (4,3), so moving to (5,2) might not be blocked. Let me think about it. If I go to (6,2), then LEFT to (5,2), then LEFT to (4,2) which is where Snake #2's body is. So that's not safe.\n\nHmm, maybe I should go another way. Alternatively, I could move UP from (6,1) to (6,2), then move LEFT to (5,2), then LEFT to (4,2) is blocked, so perhaps go UP to (5,3), then LEFT.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This seems complicated. Maybe I should instead go for the apple at (1,7). Let's see, from (6,1), I can move LEFT to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then UP to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). That's 9 moves, which is a lot, but maybe it's safer.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,5) is closer. Let's try to find a safe path. Maybe go around Snake #2 by moving down first, but from (6,1), moving DOWN isn't possible because I'm at the bottom. So I have to go LEFT or UP.\n\nAnother approach: From (6,1), moving UP to (6,2), then LEFT to (5,2), then LEFT to (4,2) which is blocked. So I can't go that way. Maybe move UP more to (6,3), then LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT to (4,3) where the enemy is. That's also blocked.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (0,6). From (6,1), moving LEFT to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), then UP to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6). That's 10 moves, but it avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just go for the nearest apple, even if it means taking a risk. Let me try moving LEFT once to (5,1), then LEFT to (4,1), then LEFT to (3,1), and so on.\n\nWait, but if I go LEFT to (3,1), then I can move UP to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). That way, I avoid the enemy snake. So from (6,1), move LEFT to (5,1), then LEFT to (4,1), LEFT to (3,1), then UP to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5). That seems safer.\n\nBut that's a lot of moves. I'm not sure if I can get there before the enemy does something. Maybe I should try that path.\n\nSo, the next move would be LEFT, from (6,1) to (5,1). Then, I'll continue LEFT as much as possible while avoiding the enemy.\n</think>\n\nLEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nStrategy: Move left towards the apple at (2,5) while avoiding enemy Snake #2, then consider heading towards other apples.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
