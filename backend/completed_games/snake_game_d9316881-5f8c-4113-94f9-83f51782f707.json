While it's one step away from the apple at (9, 3), reaching it would require moving UP in the subsequent turn. However, being near the edge might limit movement options in the future.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 2):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell at (7, 2) is empty and within the board boundaries.\n   - **Potential:** Moving LEFT does not bring the snake closer to any immediate apples. This move maintains safety but doesn't offer immediate scoring opportunities.\n\n4. **DOWN to (8, 1):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell at (8, 1) is currently occupied by the snake's tail.\n   - **Potential:** Moving DOWN would result in the snake running into itself, leading to death.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- **Primary Goal:** Prioritize collecting nearby apples to maximize points.\n- **Flexibility:** Maintain central positioning to keep movement options open and avoid getting trapped by walls or other snakes.\n- **Safety:** Avoid moves that could lead to immediate danger, such as running into the snake's own body or enemy snakes.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **UP** to (8, 3) aligns with the primary goal of collecting the nearby apple at (9, 3) in the next move while maintaining flexibility for future maneuvers.\n\n**Next Move:** UP"
