Another option is the apple at (7, 2), which is relatively closer. I should consider moving down to get closer to this apple.\n\nI should also keep an eye on Snake #2, which is at position (3, 8) with a body part at (3, 7). It's not a threat to me for now, but I should be cautious of its movements.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns will be to continue moving towards the apples while keeping an eye on the enemy snakes' positions to avoid any potential threats. I'll prioritize getting the closest apple, which seems to be the one at (7, 2).\n\nSince I'm currently at (7, 4) and the apple at (7, 2) is below me, I should move down to get closer to it. This will also put me in a good position to potentially move right and get the apple at (8, 3) in the future.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving towards the apples and try to get the one at (7, 2).\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN"
