I could try to go for one of those apples, but I'd need to navigate around the enemy snake #1.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to move up and explore the top half of the board. There's an apple at (9, 8) at the top-right corner, and another apple at (3, 5) in the middle. Moving up could give me more options and potentially put me in a better position to grab more apples.\n\nFor now, I think I'll play it safe and move to the right. This will give me more space to maneuver and potentially set me up for a future move towards one of the apples.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to keep an eye on the enemy snake #1 and be prepared to adapt my plan if it starts to move towards me.\n\nMy decided next move is: RIGHT"
