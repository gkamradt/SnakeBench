DOWN \u2192 (6,5)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (6,5) is also clear.\n\nGiven that our goal is to collect apples for score and growth, the apple at (7,6) is a prime target. It\u2019s only one step to the right and there are no hazards blocking that move.\n\nThus, the best next move is to go RIGHT.\n\nStrategy note for later turns:\n\u2022 After eating the apple at (7,6), keep looking ahead to avoid boxing yourself in while going after the cluster of remaining apples. Also, monitor the enemy snake\u2019s position to ensure safe paths.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

From (6,5) the distance to (4,3) becomes |6\u20134| + |5\u20133| = 2 + 2 = 4.  \n\u2022 RIGHT to (8,5): Although safe, this moves us away from the group of nearby apples on the left.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT get us closer, but moving LEFT preserves a more direct horizontal alignment with our target apples, setting us up for subsequent downward moves if needed without risk of boxing ourselves in.\n\nThus, I decide the next move will be LEFT.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
