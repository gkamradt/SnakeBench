          "1": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (6,4). The apples are at (1,0), (0,8), (3,3), (1,5), (9,9). The enemy snake is at (1,1) with an empty body, so it's just a head. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for possible collisions and apple opportunities.\n\nStarting with UP: Moving up from (6,4) would take me to (6,5). Is that a safe spot? Looking at the board state, row 5 has an apple at (1,5), but (6,5) is empty. No snakes there. So moving UP would be safe. Also, there's no apple there, so I wouldn't grow, but it's a safe move.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (6,3). Checking the board, row 3 has an apple at (3,3), but (6,3) is empty. No snakes there either. So that's safe. Again, no apple here, so no growth.\n\nLEFT: Moving left to (5,4). Is there anything there? The board shows row 4 as having snake 1 at (6,4), so left would be (5,4). No apples there, and no other snakes. So that's safe. But moving left would take me towards the center maybe?\n\nRIGHT: Moving right to (7,4). That's empty. No apples, no snakes. Also safe.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apples are (3,3) and (1,5). Let's see. From (6,4), moving left towards (3,3) would require going left three times and down once. But moving left once now would be a step in that direction. Alternatively, moving up towards (1,5) would require moving up once to (6,5), then left multiple times. But (1,5) is in row 5, column 1. So from (6,5), moving left five times. That's a longer path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is far away. Probably not worth going for right now. The apple at (0,8) is also far. The apple at (1,0) is at the bottom left. Maybe not the best target.\n\nSo between (3,3) and (1,5), which is closer? Let's calculate the Manhattan distance. From (6,4) to (3,3): (6-3)+(4-3)=3+1=4. To (1,5): (6-1)+(5-4)=5+1=6. So (3,3) is closer. So maybe moving towards (3,3) is better. To get there, I need to go left and down. But right now, moving left would take me to (5,4), then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That's three lefts and a down. But each move needs to avoid obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (6,3) would get me closer to (3,3). From (6,3), moving left three times to (3,3). That's three lefts. So maybe moving down first is better. Wait, but moving down from (6,4) to (6,3) is one step. Then left three times. So total four moves. Alternatively, moving left three times and then down once would be four moves as well. So same distance. But maybe the path is safer.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,1). It's a head with no body. So if I move towards (3,3), I need to be cautious of where the enemy might go. Since snake 2 is at (1,1), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. But their body is empty, so they can move freely except into walls or themselves. But they might be going for apples too. The apple at (1,5) is in their vicinity. So maybe they'll move up towards (1,5). If that's the case, maybe I should avoid that area to prevent collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,3) might be safer since the enemy is at (1,1), which is a bit away. Let's see. If I move left now to (5,4), then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That path is clear. But I need to check if any of those positions are occupied by other snakes. Currently, the enemy is at (1,1), so their movement could take them elsewhere, but their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into the same spot.\n\nHmm. So perhaps moving left towards (3,3) is a good plan. But first, moving left to (5,4) is safe. Then next steps. Alternatively, moving down to (6,3) and then left. Let's see. Which direction is safer in terms of not getting trapped.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,5) is in row 5. If I move up to (6,5), then I can start moving left towards (1,5). But that's a longer path, but maybe there's an apple there. But moving up would take me to (6,5), which is safe. Then next move left to (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. However, if I can reach (1,5) before the enemy snake does, that's a point. But the enemy is at (1,1), so they might move up towards (1,2), (1,3), etc. To reach (1,5), they need four moves up. If I move up now, then left five times, that's six moves. So the enemy might get there first. So maybe not worth it.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (3,3) is closer. So moving towards that. So which direction now? If I move left, I can start heading towards (3,3). But moving left now to (5,4) is safe. Then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That's three lefts and a down. Each step needs to check for safety. But since the enemy is at (1,1), they might not interfere with that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3) and then left. Let's see. From (6,3), moving left three times to (3,3). That's three lefts. So same number of steps. But moving down first might be better because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Wait, the apple is at (3,3). So moving down from (6,4) to (6,3) gets me to y=3, which is the same as the apple's y. Then moving left three times. So that's a possible path.\n\nBut which direction is safer? Let's check possible collisions. If I move left, the next position is (5,4). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (1,1), so no. Moving down to (6,3) is also safe. So both options are safe. But which path is better in terms of avoiding the enemy and getting the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (1,0) is possible. But that's at the bottom left. From (6,4), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (1,1). If I move towards (3,3), I might cross paths with the enemy if they move towards (3,3) as well. But since they are at (1,1), their possible path to (3,3) would be moving right and up. For example, moving right to (2,1), then up to (2,2), etc. But that's speculative. They might not go that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go towards the nearest apple, which is (3,3). So moving left or down first. Let's see. If I move left now, I can start heading west. If I move down, I go south. Which direction gives me more options in the future.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), then next turn I can go left again to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That path is clear. Alternatively, moving down to (6,3), then left to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc. But that's a different path.\n\nWait, the apple is at (3,3). So from (6,4), moving left three times and down once. Or moving down once and left three times. Either way, same number of steps. But moving left first might be better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there's any obstacles in those paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better. Let's say I move left to (5,4). Then next move left to (4,4). Then left to (3,4). Then down to (3,3). That's four moves. Each step is safe as long as no other snake moves into those positions. But since the enemy is at (1,1), they might not interfere with that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,3), then left three times. That's also four moves. So same.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first allows me to be in a position where I can adjust if needed. For example, if after moving left to (5,4), the enemy moves into (3,3), then I can change direction. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (1,5) is better. Let's see. From (6,4), moving up to (6,5), then left to (5,5), then left to (4,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe there's an apple there. The apple at (1,5) is in row 5, column 1. So from (6,5), moving left five times. That's five moves. But the enemy is at (1,1), which is below (1,5). So they might move up towards (1,5) as well. If they do, they can reach (1,5) in four moves (up four times). So if I take five moves, they might get there first. So maybe not worth it.\n\nSo the best bet is to go for the closest apple at (3,3). So which direction to take now? Let's see. If I move left now, I start heading west. If I move down, I start heading south. Which is better.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving down to (6,3), then left three times. Also four moves. So same.\n\nBut moving left first might be better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. Also, moving left now would take me to (5,4), which is closer to the center. Maybe that gives me more space to maneuver in case of unexpected moves from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3) would take me closer to the bottom, but there's an apple at (1,0) which is far. Not sure.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (1,1). If I move left, I'm moving towards the center, which might be safer. If I move down, I'm moving towards the bottom edge, which is near the apple at (1,0). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (7,4) is a safe move that opens up more space. But there's no apple there. But moving right would take me away from the apples. So probably not the best choice.\n\nSo between UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP and RIGHT don't lead towards any apples. DOWN and LEFT lead towards (3,3). So between DOWN and LEFT.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,4), then next move I can go LEFT again. If I move DOWN to (6,3), next move LEFT. Both are valid. But which is better.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start me on the path towards (3,3) in the x-direction. Moving DOWN would start me on the y-direction. Since the apple is at (3,3), both x and y need to decrease. So moving left or down are both steps towards it.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is better because the x distance is 3 (from 6 to 3) and the y distance is 1 (from 4 to 3). So reducing the x distance first might be more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving down reduces the y distance to 0, but then I have to move left three times. Either way, same number of steps. So maybe it's a tie.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first gives me more flexibility. For example, if after moving left to (5,4), I can then decide to go down or left again. Whereas moving down to (6,3) would commit me to moving left next.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first is better because it gets me to the same y as the apple, so I can then move left directly towards it. Let's see. If I move down to (6,3), then next move left to (5,3), then left to (4,3), then left to (3,3). That's three lefts. So total four moves. Same as the other path.\n\nBut in this case, after moving down, I'm at (6,3). Then moving left three times. So that's a straight line left. But maybe that's a safer path because I'm on the same y as the apple, so no need to adjust y again.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first and then down. Let's say I move left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That's three lefts and a down. But in this path, after each left, I'm at y=4, then y=4, then y=4, then down to y=3. So that's a bit more varied.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving down first is better because it aligns me with the apple's y-coordinate, making the path straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (6,3) moving left to (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). Are those positions safe? Currently, there's no snakes there. The enemy is at (1,1), so their movement could take them elsewhere, but as of now, those positions are clear.\n\nSo perhaps moving down to (6,3) is a good first step. Then left three times. But I need to make sure that each move is safe. For example, after moving down to (6,3), the next move left to (5,3) is safe. Then (4,3), then (3,3). All those positions are empty now.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). Those positions are also empty.\n\nSo both paths are safe. So which one to choose?\n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (1,1). If I move down to (6,3), I'm moving away from the enemy's current position. If I move left to (5,4), I'm moving towards the center. Maybe moving away from the enemy is safer, but the enemy is at (1,1), which is far from (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going to move towards the apple at (1,5). If they move up four times, they can reach (1,5). But that's a possibility. But I can't predict their moves. So perhaps focusing on my own path is better.\n\nIn that case, either direction is okay. But since both paths are safe, maybe I should choose the one that gets me to the apple in the same number of steps but perhaps with more flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it allows me to potentially go for other apples if needed. For example, if after moving left to (5,4), I can decide to go up towards (1,5) if the path is clear. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple at (3,3) in terms of y-coordinate. So maybe that's better.\n\nBut honestly, both options are valid. Since the apple is at (3,3), moving left or down now are both steps towards it. So perhaps the best move is to start moving left towards the apple. So direction LEFT.\n\nWait, but moving left from (6,4) to (5,4) is a step towards (3,3). Then next move left again. That seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3) is also a step towards (3,3). So which one?\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (3,3) is in the same column as the enemy's current position (1,1) is in column 1. So moving towards (3,3) is in column 3, which is not directly in the enemy's path. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left is better. Let's say I move left to (5,4). Then next turn, I can move left again to (4,4), and so on. That path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3) and then left. Either way, same steps.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is better because it reduces the x distance first, which is larger (3 steps) compared to the y distance (1 step). So reducing the larger distance first might be more efficient.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT now is the best choice. That way, I start moving towards the apple's x-coordinate. Then next moves can adjust y as needed.\n\nBut wait, the apple is at (3,3). So after moving left to (5,4), I need to move left two more times to reach x=3, and then down once. So three lefts and a down. Alternatively, moving down first and then three lefts. Same steps.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is better because it starts the journey towards the apple's x-coordinate, which is the main part of the distance.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Both are safe. Let's pick LEFT.\n\nBut wait, let's check the board again. The apple at (3,3) is in row 3, column 3. The current position is (6,4). Moving left to (5,4) is safe. Then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). All those positions are empty now. So that's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3), then left to (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). Also valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is better because it's a step towards the apple's x-coordinate, which is a larger distance. So I'll choose LEFT.\n\nBut wait, another thought: moving down first would align me with the apple's y-coordinate, so I can then move left directly. Whereas moving left first would require me to adjust the y-coordinate later. Maybe aligning the y-coordinate first is better.\n\nHmm. Let's think. If I move down to (6,3), then I'm at y=3, same as the apple. Then I can move left three times to reach x=3. That's a straight line. Whereas moving left first would require me to move down later. So maybe moving down first is better because it simplifies the path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first and then down. But both paths are the same length.\n\nBut perhaps moving down first is better because it's a single step to align y, then three steps left. Whereas moving left first requires three steps left and one down. But the total steps are the same.\n\nBut maybe moving down first is safer because once I'm at y=3, I can focus on moving left without worrying about y-coordinate. But that's just a matter of preference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards the apple's x-coordinate, which is the main part of the distance.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. Both options are valid. Let's consider the enemy's position again. The enemy is at (1,1). If I move down to (6,3), I'm moving away from the enemy. If I move left to (5,4), I'm moving towards the center. Maybe moving away from the enemy is safer, but the enemy is at (1,1), which is far from both (5,4) and (6,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going to move towards the apple at (1,5). If they do, they might move up. So moving towards (3,3) is safer as it's away from their path.\n\nIn that case, moving left or down are both safe. Let's pick LEFT as the first move to start heading towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nSo the final decision is to move LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for possible collisions and apple opportunities.\n\nStarting with UP: Moving up from (6,4) would take me to (6,5). Is that a safe spot? Looking at the board state, row 5 has an apple at (1,5), but (6,5) is empty. No snakes there. So moving UP would be safe. Also, there's no apple there, so I wouldn't grow, but it's a safe move.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (6,3). Checking the board, row 3 has an apple at (3,3), but (6,3) is empty. No snakes there either. So that's safe. Again, no apple here, so no growth.\n\nLEFT: Moving left to (5,4). Is there anything there? The board shows row 4 as having snake 1 at (6,4), so left would be (5,4). No apples there, and no other snakes. So that's safe. But moving left would take me towards the center maybe?\n\nRIGHT: Moving right to (7,4). That's empty. No apples, no snakes. Also safe.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apples are (3,3) and (1,5). Let's see. From (6,4), moving left towards (3,3) would require going left three times and down once. But moving left once now would be a step in that direction. Alternatively, moving up towards (1,5) would require moving up once to (6,5), then left multiple times. But (1,5) is in row 5, column 1. So from (6,5), moving left five times. That's a longer path. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is far away. Probably not worth going for right now. The apple at (0,8) is also far. The apple at (1,0) is at the bottom left. Maybe not the best target.\n\nSo between (3,3) and (1,5), which is closer? Let's calculate the Manhattan distance. From (6,4) to (3,3): (6-3)+(4-3)=3+1=4. To (1,5): (6-1)+(5-4)=5+1=6. So (3,3) is closer. So maybe moving towards (3,3) is better. To get there, I need to go left and down. But right now, moving left would take me to (5,4), then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That's three lefts and a down. But each move needs to avoid obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (6,3) would get me closer to (3,3). From (6,3), moving left three times to (3,3). That's three lefts. So maybe moving down first is better. Wait, but moving down from (6,4) to (6,3) is one step. Then left three times. So total four moves. Alternatively, moving left three times and then down once would be four moves as well. So same distance. But maybe the path is safer.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (1,1). It's a head with no body. So if I move towards (3,3), I need to be cautious of where the enemy might go. Since snake 2 is at (1,1), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. But their body is empty, so they can move freely except into walls or themselves. But they might be going for apples too. The apple at (1,5) is in their vicinity. So maybe they'll move up towards (1,5). If that's the case, maybe I should avoid that area to prevent collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,3) might be safer since the enemy is at (1,1), which is a bit away. Let's see. If I move left now to (5,4), then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That path is clear. But I need to check if any of those positions are occupied by other snakes. Currently, the enemy is at (1,1), so their movement could take them elsewhere, but their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into the same spot.\n\nHmm. So perhaps moving left towards (3,3) is a good plan. But first, moving left to (5,4) is safe. Then next steps. Alternatively, moving down to (6,3) and then left. Let's see. Which direction is safer in terms of not getting trapped.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (1,5) is in row 5. If I move up to (6,5), then I can start moving left towards (1,5). But that's a longer path, but maybe there's an apple there. But moving up would take me to (6,5), which is safe. Then next move left to (5,5), etc. But that's a longer path. However, if I can reach (1,5) before the enemy snake does, that's a point. But the enemy is at (1,1), so they might move up towards (1,2), (1,3), etc. To reach (1,5), they need four moves up. If I move up now, then left five times, that's six moves. So the enemy might get there first. So maybe not worth it.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (3,3) is closer. So moving towards that. So which direction now? If I move left, I can start heading towards (3,3). But moving left now to (5,4) is safe. Then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That's three lefts and a down. Each step needs to check for safety. But since the enemy is at (1,1), they might not interfere with that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3) and then left. Let's see. From (6,3), moving left three times to (3,3). That's three lefts. So same number of steps. But moving down first might be better because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Wait, the apple is at (3,3). So moving down from (6,4) to (6,3) gets me to y=3, which is the same as the apple's y. Then moving left three times. So that's a possible path.\n\nBut which direction is safer? Let's check possible collisions. If I move left, the next position is (5,4). Is there any snake there? The enemy is at (1,1), so no. Moving down to (6,3) is also safe. So both options are safe. But which path is better in terms of avoiding the enemy and getting the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (1,0) is possible. But that's at the bottom left. From (6,4), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (1,1). If I move towards (3,3), I might cross paths with the enemy if they move towards (3,3) as well. But since they are at (1,1), their possible path to (3,3) would be moving right and up. For example, moving right to (2,1), then up to (2,2), etc. But that's speculative. They might not go that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go towards the nearest apple, which is (3,3). So moving left or down first. Let's see. If I move left now, I can start heading west. If I move down, I go south. Which direction gives me more options in the future.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), then next turn I can go left again to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That path is clear. Alternatively, moving down to (6,3), then left to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc. But that's a different path.\n\nWait, the apple is at (3,3). So from (6,4), moving left three times and down once. Or moving down once and left three times. Either way, same number of steps. But moving left first might be better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. But I need to check if there's any obstacles in those paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better. Let's say I move left to (5,4). Then next move left to (4,4). Then left to (3,4). Then down to (3,3). That's four moves. Each step is safe as long as no other snake moves into those positions. But since the enemy is at (1,1), they might not interfere with that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,3), then left three times. That's also four moves. So same.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first allows me to be in a position where I can adjust if needed. For example, if after moving left to (5,4), the enemy moves into (3,3), then I can change direction. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (1,5) is better. Let's see. From (6,4), moving up to (6,5), then left to (5,5), then left to (4,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe there's an apple there. The apple at (1,5) is in row 5, column 1. So from (6,5), moving left five times. That's five moves. But the enemy is at (1,1), which is below (1,5). So they might move up towards (1,5) as well. If they do, they can reach (1,5) in four moves (up four times). So if I take five moves, they might get there first. So maybe not worth it.\n\nSo the best bet is to go for the closest apple at (3,3). So which direction to take now? Let's see. If I move left now, I start heading west. If I move down, I start heading south. Which is better.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving down to (6,3), then left three times. Also four moves. So same.\n\nBut moving left first might be better because I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. Also, moving left now would take me to (5,4), which is closer to the center. Maybe that gives me more space to maneuver in case of unexpected moves from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3) would take me closer to the bottom, but there's an apple at (1,0) which is far. Not sure.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (1,1). If I move left, I'm moving towards the center, which might be safer. If I move down, I'm moving towards the bottom edge, which is near the apple at (1,0). But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (7,4) is a safe move that opens up more space. But there's no apple there. But moving right would take me away from the apples. So probably not the best choice.\n\nSo between UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP and RIGHT don't lead towards any apples. DOWN and LEFT lead towards (3,3). So between DOWN and LEFT.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,4), then next move I can go LEFT again. If I move DOWN to (6,3), next move LEFT. Both are valid. But which is better.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start me on the path towards (3,3) in the x-direction. Moving DOWN would start me on the y-direction. Since the apple is at (3,3), both x and y need to decrease. So moving left or down are both steps towards it.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is better because the x distance is 3 (from 6 to 3) and the y distance is 1 (from 4 to 3). So reducing the x distance first might be more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving down reduces the y distance to 0, but then I have to move left three times. Either way, same number of steps. So maybe it's a tie.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first gives me more flexibility. For example, if after moving left to (5,4), I can then decide to go down or left again. Whereas moving down to (6,3) would commit me to moving left next.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first is better because it gets me to the same y as the apple, so I can then move left directly towards it. Let's see. If I move down to (6,3), then next move left to (5,3), then left to (4,3), then left to (3,3). That's three lefts. So total four moves. Same as the other path.\n\nBut in this case, after moving down, I'm at (6,3). Then moving left three times. So that's a straight line left. But maybe that's a safer path because I'm on the same y as the apple, so no need to adjust y again.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first and then down. Let's say I move left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). That's three lefts and a down. But in this path, after each left, I'm at y=4, then y=4, then y=4, then down to y=3. So that's a bit more varied.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving down first is better because it aligns me with the apple's y-coordinate, making the path straightforward. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (6,3) moving left to (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). Are those positions safe? Currently, there's no snakes there. The enemy is at (1,1), so their movement could take them elsewhere, but as of now, those positions are clear.\n\nSo perhaps moving down to (6,3) is a good first step. Then left three times. But I need to make sure that each move is safe. For example, after moving down to (6,3), the next move left to (5,3) is safe. Then (4,3), then (3,3). All those positions are empty now.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). Those positions are also empty.\n\nSo both paths are safe. So which one to choose?\n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (1,1). If I move down to (6,3), I'm moving away from the enemy's current position. If I move left to (5,4), I'm moving towards the center. Maybe moving away from the enemy is safer, but the enemy is at (1,1), which is far from (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going to move towards the apple at (1,5). If they move up four times, they can reach (1,5). But that's a possibility. But I can't predict their moves. So perhaps focusing on my own path is better.\n\nIn that case, either direction is okay. But since both paths are safe, maybe I should choose the one that gets me to the apple in the same number of steps but perhaps with more flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it allows me to potentially go for other apples if needed. For example, if after moving left to (5,4), I can decide to go up towards (1,5) if the path is clear. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple at (3,3) in terms of y-coordinate. So maybe that's better.\n\nBut honestly, both options are valid. Since the apple is at (3,3), moving left or down now are both steps towards it. So perhaps the best move is to start moving left towards the apple. So direction LEFT.\n\nWait, but moving left from (6,4) to (5,4) is a step towards (3,3). Then next move left again. That seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3) is also a step towards (3,3). So which one?\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (3,3) is in the same column as the enemy's current position (1,1) is in column 1. So moving towards (3,3) is in column 3, which is not directly in the enemy's path. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left is better. Let's say I move left to (5,4). Then next turn, I can move left again to (4,4), and so on. That path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3) and then left. Either way, same steps.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is better because it reduces the x distance first, which is larger (3 steps) compared to the y distance (1 step). So reducing the larger distance first might be more efficient.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT now is the best choice. That way, I start moving towards the apple's x-coordinate. Then next moves can adjust y as needed.\n\nBut wait, the apple is at (3,3). So after moving left to (5,4), I need to move left two more times to reach x=3, and then down once. So three lefts and a down. Alternatively, moving down first and then three lefts. Same steps.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is better because it starts the journey towards the apple's x-coordinate, which is the main part of the distance.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Both are safe. Let's pick LEFT.\n\nBut wait, let's check the board again. The apple at (3,3) is in row 3, column 3. The current position is (6,4). Moving left to (5,4) is safe. Then next move left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then down to (3,3). All those positions are empty now. So that's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (6,3), then left to (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). Also valid.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is better because it's a step towards the apple's x-coordinate, which is a larger distance. So I'll choose LEFT.\n\nBut wait, another thought: moving down first would align me with the apple's y-coordinate, so I can then move left directly. Whereas moving left first would require me to adjust the y-coordinate later. Maybe aligning the y-coordinate first is better.\n\nHmm. Let's think. If I move down to (6,3), then I'm at y=3, same as the apple. Then I can move left three times to reach x=3. That's a straight line. Whereas moving left first would require me to move down later. So maybe moving down first is better because it simplifies the path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first and then down. But both paths are the same length.\n\nBut perhaps moving down first is better because it's a single step to align y, then three steps left. Whereas moving left first requires three steps left and one down. But the total steps are the same.\n\nBut maybe moving down first is safer because once I'm at y=3, I can focus on moving left without worrying about y-coordinate. But that's just a matter of preference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards the apple's x-coordinate, which is the main part of the distance.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. Both options are valid. Let's consider the enemy's position again. The enemy is at (1,1). If I move down to (6,3), I'm moving away from the enemy. If I move left to (5,4), I'm moving towards the center. Maybe moving away from the enemy is safer, but the enemy is at (1,1), which is far from both (5,4) and (6,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going to move towards the apple at (1,5). If they do, they might move up. So moving towards (3,3) is safer as it's away from their path.\n\nIn that case, moving left or down are both safe. Let's pick LEFT as the first move to start heading towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nSo the final decision is to move LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"
