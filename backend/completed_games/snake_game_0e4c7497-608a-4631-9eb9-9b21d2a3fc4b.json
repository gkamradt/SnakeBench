Additionally, there is another apple directly above at (9,8), but it is probably too far away to consider now.\n- If I move left, I need to consider how far I should go before turning downwards to get the apple at (2,5). The path looks clear from obstacles.\n- Enemy snake (#2) is currently at (1,4), which is also towards the left side. I should be cautious not to collide with it in future moves once I am at a lower y-coordinate.\n- A good strategy is to fetch the apples on the left side, keeping an eye on the movements of the enemy snake and any potential new obstacles.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\n- After reaching closer to the left side (x-coordinate around 2), consider moving downwards to fetch the apple at (2,5) if it is still safe to do so. Adjust course based on any changes like new snakes or board obstacles.\n\nDecided Next Move: LEFT."
