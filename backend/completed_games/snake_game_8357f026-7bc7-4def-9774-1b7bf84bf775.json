Prioritize the apple at (0, 8) if it remains safe to reach, as it is closer than the others.\n4. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movements and adapt the strategy as needed to avoid collision and maximize points.\n5. If the path to any of the apples becomes blocked or unsafe, consider alternative routes or focus on survival until a safe opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: UP"

The enemy snake is still at a safe distance, with its head at (9, 7) and its body extending downwards.\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 7), which I should prioritize. However, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's potential movements. If the enemy snake moves left, it could block my path to the apple at (2, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n1. Move right to position (1, 8) to get closer to the apple at (2, 7).\n2. Evaluate the enemy snake's movement and adjust the strategy accordingly.\n3. If the path to the apple at (2, 7) remains safe, continue moving towards it.\n4. If the enemy snake moves in a way that threatens the path, consider alternative routes or focus on survival.\n5. Keep an eye on the other apples, especially the one at (3, 1), as it could be a good target if the path to (2, 7) becomes too risky.\n\nStrategy to remember for future turns:\n- Prioritize safe paths to the nearest apples.\n- Continuously monitor the enemy snake's movements and adapt the strategy as needed.\n- Consider alternative apple targets if the primary target becomes too risky.\n- Focus on survival if no safe paths to apples are available.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Two apples are equally near in Manhattan distance: apple (5,7) is 3 cells left (8\u21927\u21926\u21925 on x) while apple (6,6) is 2 cells left and 1 cell down (a total of 3 moves).\n\n\u2022 Looking at the board row 7: we see that cell (7,7) is open. From (8,7), moving LEFT will get us closer to both the apple at (5,7) (if we follow left-left-left) and also set us up to eventually reach apple (6,6) (if we then go down and left).  \n\n\u2022 Checking surrounding cells:\n\u2003\u2013 UP from (8,7) would take us to (8,8). That cell is not marked with any obstacles, but it doesn\u2019t help our horizontal progress toward either apple.\n\u2003\u2013 RIGHT would be off board.\n\u2003\u2013 DOWN from (8,7) leads to (8,6); checking row 6, column 8 shows a \u201c.\u201d so it\u2019s safe but does not advance us horizontally.\n\u2003\u2013 LEFT moves us to (7,7), a safe cell that immediately gets us closer to our targets.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no immediate risk from enemy Snake #2 who is on the far left, so our path planning remains localized.\n\nMy short-term strategy is:\n1. Move LEFT from (8,7) to (7,7).\n2. In upcoming moves, decide whether to continue left to get the apple at (5,7) or head down (and then left) toward (6,6), based on how the board evolves.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: LEFT."

Alternatively, notice the apple at (8,5). From (6,6) moving RIGHT to (7,6) sets up an easy pathway: on a future move we could go DOWN from (7,6) to (7,5) and then RIGHT to grab the apple at (8,5).\n\n\u2022 Both LEFT and RIGHT are open, but since the enemy snake is farther left (with head at (3,7) and body segments crowding that side) the right side appears slightly less congested. Heading RIGHT keeps our options open for safe maneuvers and avoids the more \u201ccluttered\u201d left bank where tactical complications might arise.\n\nThus, to move toward a reachable apple while preserving maneuverability, the decision is to move RIGHT.\n\nNEXT MOVE: RIGHT"
