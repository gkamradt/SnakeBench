This path appears safe since there are no other snakes in the immediate vicinity or potential threats.\n- **Apple at (2, 0), (4, 5), and (8, 3):** These apples are either farther away or align near Snake #2, which increases the risk.\n- **Apple at (7, 2):** Southward path increasing contact with Snake #2, it's best to avoid for now.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n\n- **Snake #2:** Located quite a bit below at (9, 4) but moving towards the apple at (8, 3) could bring me closer to it. Hence it's safer to focus on moving leftwards and upward to secure an apple without converging towards a potential collision.\n\n**Strategizing:**\n\nContinuing the strategy of targeting the apple at (5, 8) seems sound.

I need to decide which apple to target next. The apple at (8, 6) is diagonally up-right and seems reachable without immediate threats. Alternatively, the apple at (4, 5) is diagonally up-left and also seems viable. Moving towards the center of the board might provide better positioning for future moves.\n\n**Next Move:** **RIGHT**  \n**Rationale:** Moving right to (8, 2) positions me closer to the apple at (8, 6). From there, I can plan to move upwards towards the apple. This move also keeps me away from the enemy snake at (5, 7) and allows for greater flexibility in future moves.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**  \nAfter moving right, I should evaluate the new board state and consider moving upwards towards the apple at (8, 6). If that path becomes blocked, I can reassess and consider other options or move towards the center for better positioning.\n\n**Next Move:** **RIGHT**"
