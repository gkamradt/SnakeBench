Given the position of the other snake, moving down would also allow me to attack from below, potentially giving me the retreat option to the right if necessary.\n\nRight now my goal is to stay away from Snake #1 while I gather more points.

Additionally, moving right offers more potential paths and flexibility for future moves. \n\nLooking at the positions of the apples and the other snake, I can see that I can also potentially lure Snake #1 to the left side of the board by going for the apple on the opposite side. This would give me the chance to claim the apple at (7, 8), which seems to be in a relatively safe position now.\n\nOn my next move, I want to keep an eye on how Snake #1 reacts to my change in direction.
