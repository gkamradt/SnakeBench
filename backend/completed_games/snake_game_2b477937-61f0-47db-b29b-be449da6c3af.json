The closest apple to our snake appears to be at (5, 3), but we should also consider the apple at (5, 9) since it's relatively close to our current position.\n\nGiven the positions of the apples and our snake, moving towards the apple at (5, 9) seems like a good initial strategy because it's closer to our current position and moving towards it doesn't immediately put us in danger of running into the wall or the other snake.\n\nHowever, we should also keep an eye on Snake #1's position at (4, 7) to avoid any potential collisions. Since Snake #1 is currently at the same y-coordinate as our snake and is positioned to the left, we need to be cautious about moving left.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best initial move would be to head towards the apple at (5, 9). To do this, we need to move up and to the left. Since we can only move in one of the four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) per turn, our first move should be to move up, as this gets us closer to the target apple without immediately risking collision with Snake #1 or the wall.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue to move towards the apple at (5, 9) while keeping an eye on Snake #1's movements to avoid collisions.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
