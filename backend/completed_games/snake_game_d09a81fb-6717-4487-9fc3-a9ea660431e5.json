Based on my position on the board, let's reassess the situation.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- **Position**: I am currently at (4, 6).\n- **Enemy Snake**: Snake #2 is positioned at (3, 6) with no body, which means it could move in multiple directions but is not immediately threatening my current position given its absence of body and proximity limitations in terms of direct conflict.\n- **Apples**:\n  - (0, 4) is not immediately reachable and would require moving left first, which takes me closer to the enemy snake and away from the current safer path.\n  - (4, 9) and (3, 9) are directly reachable by moving up, with (4, 9) offering the shortest route without lateral moves.\n  - (8, 0) and (0, 6) are not currently within optimal reach due to their distance and board layout.\n\n### Immediate Analysis:\n- **Safe Moves**: Continuing upwards towards (4, 9) remains a viable and safe option. There's no immediate threat by moving up since columns 4 and 3 up to row 9 have no obstacles.\n- **Dangers**:\n  - Moving left towards the enemy snake is still risky as it increases the chance of encountering Snake #2.\n  - Moving right or down really moves me away from apples unless a strategic repositioning is adopted for future moves.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Continue Upward**: Let's maintain our upward direction towards the nearest apple at (4, 9) to capitalize on point accumulation as it's a clear path with minimal associated risks.\n2. **Monitor Opponent**:\n   - I should be prepared to adapt if Snake #2 decides to move in my direction. \n   - Post-move, consider recalibrating the future move strategy based on enemy's actions and board changes.\n\n### Decision:\nContinuing to move UP will keep me on a clear path to reach a nearby apple without unnecessary hazards.\n\n**Planned Move**: UP"
