It gives me a clear space without risking a position adjacent to the enemy snake, while positioning me in a column where I can further assess my moves toward apples in future turns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 8) will allow me to stay flexible and open up more options in subsequent moves. I can then consider whether to move towards any apples or further navigate to avoid conflict.\n\nTherefore, the decided next move is: **RIGHT**."

Now let's evaluate the situation from there.\n\n### Current State at (7, 6):\n- **My Position:** (7, 6)\n- **Apples on the Board:** (0, 0), (2, 6), (1, 5), (9, 0), (4, 7)\n- **Enemy Snake Position:** Snake #1 is at (2, 7) with a body segment at (3, 7). The enemy occupies two spaces.\n\n### Possible Moves from (7, 6):\n1. **UP to (7, 7)**: This position is currently empty but moves me away from the apples and does not get me closer to the apple at (4, 7).\n2. **DOWN to (7, 5)**: This is where I just came from, and moving backward is not a strategic choice. \n3. **LEFT to (6, 6)**: This position is empty and could open up more pathways. \n4. **RIGHT to (8, 6)**: This position is empty and would provide further movement options.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n- **UP to (7, 7)**: I could move here but it does not help in terms of scoring; it also gets me further from the apples I want to target.\n- **DOWN to (7, 5)**: Again, this is not strategic as it would mean going back.\n- **LEFT to (6, 6)**: Opens the option to potentially navigate back toward apples at a later state and avoids the enemy snake's area directly.\n- **RIGHT to (8, 6)**: This may also allow for future movement toward (9, 0) or potentially maneuvers up to row 9.\n\n### Consideration of Next Moves:\nWith two reasonable choices (LEFT and RIGHT), I need to consider access to potential apples and also avoiding conflict with the enemy. Snake #1 is confined primarily to the left side of the board, and it is worthwhile to avoid being boxed in by them.\n\nI will move LEFT to (6, 6) to position myself towards the upper left side of the board where there are additional opportunities and possible apple routes opening up later.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

Moving DOWN keeps me relatively stationary concerning apple positioning, while RIGHT potentially aligns me closer to the borders where an apple exists at (9, 0).\n\nI favor moving RIGHT towards (9, 8).

Snake #1 is confined primarily to the left side of the board, and it is worthwhile to avoid being boxed in by them.\n\nI will move LEFT to (6, 6) to position myself towards the upper left side of the board where there are additional opportunities and possible apple routes opening up later.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**"
