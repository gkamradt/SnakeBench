Meanwhile, snake #1 is just one block away from getting the uppermost apple. Given the fact that snakes grow after eating an apple, increasing their threat radius, we must be careful not to trap ourselves by going past the middle of the board. The apple at (3,5) is the closest, but directly going left could cause collision with the walls if snake #1 decides to descend after eating the apple. \n\nTherefore, the strategy will be to stay at the upper part of the board and gradually move towards the apple at (3,5). The snake should move left only when it's safe to do so i.e., when snake #1 is not in close proximity or moving upwards.\n\nRemember: Safety should be the priority over immediate score gain.
