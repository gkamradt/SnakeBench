That move would result in an immediate collision, so it's not an option.\n\u2022 Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't offer any immediate benefit, and we\u2019d be moving away from an accessible apple.\n\u2022 Moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe and gets us an apple right away.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
