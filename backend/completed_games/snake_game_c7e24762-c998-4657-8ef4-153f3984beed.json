To reach (1,7), one effective route is to head gradually downward and then left. For example:\n\u2003  \u2013 If we choose DOWN, our head goes to (2,8).\n\u2003  \u2013 Then from (2,8), we can move LEFT to (1,8).\n\u2003  \u2013 Next, moving DOWN from (1,8) would get us to (1,7) to grab the apple.\n\n\u2022 Both DOWN then LEFT, or LEFT then DOWN are viable. However, moving LEFT immediately (to (1,9)) places us nearer the left wall, potentially limiting later options.
