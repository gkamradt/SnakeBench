It maintains the snake's central position, maximizing future maneuverability and reducing the risk of getting trapped. Although it doesn't provide an immediate apple, it preserves the snake's flexibility to navigate towards available apples in subsequent turns safely.\n\n### **Next Move Decision:** **LEFT**"

Additionally, if the snake grows or if the tail doesn't move as expected, this could lead to a collision.\n\n2. **RIGHT** to (6, 8):\n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Proximity to Apple Paths:** Moving right brings you closer to the apples at (6, 7) and (6, 5).\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Enemy Proximity:** Enemy Snake #2 is nearby at (6, 4) with its body extending upwards. Moving closer increases the risk of future collisions, especially if the enemy changes direction unpredictably.\n\n3. **DOWN** to (5, 7):\n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Central Positioning:** Maintains a central location on the board, offering flexibility for future maneuvers.\n     - **Path Towards Apples:** Heading downward moves you closer to multiple apples, increasing the potential for growth.\n     - **Avoids Immediate Threats:** There are no immediate dangers in the downward direction from your current position.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **None Significant:** This move appears safe and strategically advantageous.\n\n4. **LEFT** to (4, 8):\n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Safety:** The cell (4, 8) is empty, reducing the risk of immediate collisions.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Distance from Apples:** Moving left takes the snake farther from available apples, potentially limiting point gains in the near future.\n\n### **Strategy Considerations:**\n- **Proximity to Apples:** Prioritizing movements that bring the snake closer to available apples can maximize point gains.\n- **Avoiding Immediate Dangers:** Ensuring the next move doesn't result in a collision with walls, enemy snakes, or tails is crucial for survival.\n- **Maintaining Flexibility:** Staying centrally located allows for multiple movement options in future turns, adapting to dynamic game conditions.\n- **Minimizing Risk from Enemy Snakes:** Keeping a safe distance from enemy snakes reduces the likelihood of unexpected collisions.\n\n### **Decision:**\n- **Moving DOWN to (5, 7)** is the most strategic and safe choice. It advances the snake closer to available apples, maintains central positioning for future maneuverability, and minimizes immediate collision risks.\n\n### **Next Move Decision:** **DOWN**"

Additionally, if the snake grows or if the tail doesn't move as expected, this could lead to a collision.\n\n2. **RIGHT** to (6, 8):\n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Proximity to Apple Paths:** Moving right brings you closer to the apples at (6, 7) and (6, 5).\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Enemy Proximity:** Enemy Snake #2 is nearby at (6, 4) with its body extending upwards.

It ensures the snake avoids potential collisions, maintains centrality on the board for better maneuverability, and keeps options open for accessing apples in future turns.\n\n### **Next Move Decision:** **LEFT**"

I'm still on track to reach that apple, and I don't see any immediate threats from Snake #1.\n\nSince I'm so close to the apple at (9, 2), I should continue to move right to grab it. After that, I'll reassess the situation and consider moving down to aim for the apple at (9, 0) as planned.\n\nHowever, I should also keep an eye on Snake #1's position and be prepared to adjust my strategy if needed. For now, my priority is to reach the apple at (9, 2) safely.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching the apple at (9, 2), consider moving down to aim for the apple at (9, 0) and be cautious of Snake #1's movement.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
