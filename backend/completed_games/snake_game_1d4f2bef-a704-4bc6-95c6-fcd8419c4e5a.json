Moving DOWN will get us to (2, 6) and eat the apple. This is a good move to gain points.\n\n2. **Post-Apple Strategy**: After eating the apple, the snake will grow. The new head position will be (2, 6). From there, we need to consider the positions of the other snakes:\n   - Snake #1 is at (9, 3) and has a body at [].\n   - Snake #1 is not a direct threat at this moment, but we should keep an eye on it.\n   - The snake at (1, 6) is moving towards the apple at (2, 6). We need to avoid a collision with this snake.\n\n3. **Next Moves**:\n   - If we move DOWN to (2, 6), we will eat the apple and grow.\n   - After growing, we can move RIGHT to (2, 7) and then UP to (1, 7) to avoid the snake at (1, 6).\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Moving DOWN to (2, 6) is safe for now.\n   - Moving RIGHT to (2, 7) and then UP to (1, 7) will help us avoid the snake at (1, 6).\n\nGiven this analysis, the best move is to move DOWN to eat the apple and then reassess the situation.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"
