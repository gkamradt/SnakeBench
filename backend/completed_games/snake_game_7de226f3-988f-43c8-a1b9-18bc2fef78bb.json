            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (9,9), which is the top right corner. There are five apples located at (4,9), (5,6), (4,5), (4,0), and (1,0). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (3,6) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out. The one at (4,9) is right next to my current position since I'm at (9,9). That's just a few steps to the left. Then there's another apple at (5,6), which is a bit further down. The apple at (4,5) is even further down, and the two at (4,0) and (1,0) are near the bottom left.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. So, I need to decide which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (4,9), which is only 5 units to the left from my current position. That seems like an easy target. If I move left, I can reach it quickly and gain a point.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. It's at (3,6). If I move towards (4,9), I'm going in the opposite direction from the enemy, so maybe that's safe. However, I should check if moving left from (9,9) is possible. Since the board is 10x10, moving left from (9,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. So, that's a valid move.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (4,9) would put me in a position where I might collide with myself or the enemy. Since I'm only moving left, and my body is just the head at (9,9) right now, I don't have any other body parts to worry about. The enemy is at (3,6), which is far away, so I shouldn't interfere with each other.\n\nIf I decide to go for the (4,9) apple, my path would be straightforward: move left four times to reach (5,9), then left again to (4,9). That's five moves in total. Each move left decreases my x-coordinate by 1. So, from (9,9) to (8,9), then (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), and finally (4,9). That seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (5,6), but that's further away and would require moving down and then left or right. That might take more time and could potentially put me in a position where I might run into the enemy or myself if I'm not careful.\n\nI should also think about the other apples. The ones at (4,0) and (1,0) are near the bottom left, which is quite far from my current position. It might be better to collect the closer apples first and then move on to the farther ones.\n\nSo, the immediate next step is to move left towards (4,9). That will give me a point quickly without any immediate risks. I don't see any obstacles in that path, and it's the shortest distance to an apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving left from (9,9) is allowed. Since the board is from x=0 to x=9, moving left from x=9 would take me to x=8, which is valid. So, no problem there.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the enemy snake might move towards me, but since it's only at (3,6), it's not in my path. Plus, I'm moving away from that area, so collision is unlikely.\n\nIn summary, moving left towards (4,9) seems like the best immediate move. It's the closest apple, and I can reach it without any immediate risks. After that, I can decide on the next target based on where the other apples are and the positions of the enemy snake.\n</think>\n\nThe best move is to go for the closest apple at (4,9).

Moving RIGHT would take me to (8,9), but that's away from the apple and doesn't seem necessary. Moving UP from (7,9) isn't possible because y=9 is the top, so that's a wall. Moving DOWN would take me to (7,8), which is where the enemy snake is, but since the enemy is at (3,8), that's not a problem. Wait, no, the enemy is at (3,8), so (7,8) is clear. But moving down might not be the best move since the apple is directly to the left.\n\nI should also think about potential future moves. If I go left to (6,9), then I can continue left towards the apple. There's no immediate threat from the enemy snake since it's at (3,8), which is on the opposite side of the board. So, moving left seems safe and efficient.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. The one at (5,6) is further down, but I don't need to go there right now. The apple at (4,0) is at the bottom, but that's a longer path. So, focusing on the closest apple makes sense.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to hit my own body. Since my body isn't listed, I assume it's just the head at (7,9), so moving left won't cause a collision with myself.\n\nIn summary, moving LEFT is the best option because it's the shortest path to an apple, it's safe, and there are no immediate obstacles in that direction.\n</think>\n\n**Next move: LEFT**  \n**Strategy:** Focus on the closest apple at (4,9) by moving left to (6,9) next. This path is safe and efficient."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (9,9), which is the top right corner. There are five apples located at (4,9), (5,6), (4,5), (4,0), and (1,0). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (3,6) with no body parts listed, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out. The one at (4,9) is right next to my current position since I'm at (9,9). That's just a few steps to the left. Then there's another apple at (5,6), which is a bit further down. The apple at (4,5) is even further down, and the two at (4,0) and (1,0) are near the bottom left.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. So, I need to decide which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (4,9), which is only 5 units to the left from my current position. That seems like an easy target. If I move left, I can reach it quickly and gain a point.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the enemy snake. It's at (3,6). If I move towards (4,9), I'm going in the opposite direction from the enemy, so maybe that's safe. However, I should check if moving left from (9,9) is possible. Since the board is 10x10, moving left from (9,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. So, that's a valid move.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving towards (4,9) would put me in a position where I might collide with myself or the enemy. Since I'm only moving left, and my body is just the head at (9,9) right now, I don't have any other body parts to worry about. The enemy is at (3,6), which is far away, so I shouldn't interfere with each other.\n\nIf I decide to go for the (4,9) apple, my path would be straightforward: move left four times to reach (5,9), then left again to (4,9). That's five moves in total. Each move left decreases my x-coordinate by 1. So, from (9,9) to (8,9), then (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), and finally (4,9). That seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (5,6), but that's further away and would require moving down and then left or right. That might take more time and could potentially put me in a position where I might run into the enemy or myself if I'm not careful.\n\nI should also think about the other apples. The ones at (4,0) and (1,0) are near the bottom left, which is quite far from my current position. It might be better to collect the closer apples first and then move on to the farther ones.\n\nSo, the immediate next step is to move left towards (4,9). That will give me a point quickly without any immediate risks. I don't see any obstacles in that path, and it's the shortest distance to an apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving left from (9,9) is allowed. Since the board is from x=0 to x=9, moving left from x=9 would take me to x=8, which is valid. So, no problem there.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the enemy snake might move towards me, but since it's only at (3,6), it's not in my path. Plus, I'm moving away from that area, so collision is unlikely.\n\nIn summary, moving left towards (4,9) seems like the best immediate move. It's the closest apple, and I can reach it without any immediate risks. After that, I can decide on the next target based on where the other apples are and the positions of the enemy snake.\n</think>\n\nThe best move is to go for the closest apple at (4,9). Moving left from (9,9) is safe and will allow me to collect the apple quickly.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**"
