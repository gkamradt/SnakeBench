I'll try to get as many points as possible while avoiding the enemy snake at (5, 7).\n\nHmm, I'm not sure if I should move up or right. If I move right, I'll be closer to the apple at (8, 8) but I'll also be moving away from the apple at (5, 5). On the other hand, if I move up, I'll be closer to the apple at (5, 5) but I'll also be moving into the same row as the enemy snake.\n\nI think I'll move up to the apple at (5, 5) for now. It's a safe move and it will give me a chance to grow and gain a point.\n\nMy decided next move is: UP."

Since I'm currently at (5, 7), I can move up (to (5, 6)), down (to (5, 8)), left (to (4, 7)), or right (to (6, 7)).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. If I move up, I might collide with Snake #1 at (5, 6). Moving down would take me closer to an apple at (5, 8), but there are no apples in the immediate vicinity. Moving left would take me towards an apple at (4, 8), but it's not an apple I can reach in one move. Moving right would take me towards an apple at (6, 7), which is a good option as it's within reach and I'm not currently in danger of colliding with any other snakes or the walls.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to eat the apple at (6, 7) and then move towards the apple at (8, 8) if possible.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
