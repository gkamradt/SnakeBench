However, there are no apples directly in this direction, but it gives a better vantage point for directional shifts in future turns.\n   \n   - **DOWN (9, 4):** I would move back towards the last position, avoiding potential growth and opportunity. Since this goes backwards, it's not possible since I just came from (9, 4).\n\n   - **LEFT (8, 5):** This would bring me closer to the other snake, and while there are no immediate apples in reach, it positions me closer to some on subsequent moves like the apple at (7, 3).\n   \n   - **RIGHT (10, 5):** Not feasible due to the board limit at x=9.\n\n2. **Initial Target:**\n   - Given the current facts, the closest apples are at (9, 2) and (7, 3). Approaching these could be strategically beneficial.\n   - The (9, 2) apple is directly down but requires a series of calculated movements to avoid enemy snake zones and potential traps.\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\n- Prioritizing movement toward (9, 2) seems the most straightforward based on the column alignment, despite potential danger. I should factor in enemy positioning and ensure I don\u2019t end up cornered or too close to enemy snake #2.\n- Keeping options open for the leftward move toward (7, 3) is valid as well, should pathways appear open.\n\nGiven the current position:\n\n- Focus on advancing to a safer, yet advantageous spot, not directly into enemy or immediate contest zones.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'll move **LEFT** to (8, 5) to potentially set myself up for future moves towards an apple while maintaining flexibility and safe distance from snake #2.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nAssess enemy movements closely while maneuvering towards available apples, optimizing routes for safety and growth.\n\n**Decided Next Move: LEFT**"
