Head towards the apple located at (7, 4). Given my position at (8, 8), I'll want to start by moving **LEFT** to position myself better to head downwards without running into the board edge.\n2. Monitor the movements of Snake #2, especially as I move into the lower section of the board, potentially into more contested space.\n3. After reaching the apple at (7, 4), plan to head towards the next closest apple safely, keeping an eye on the enemy snake and other obstacles.\n\n**Available Moves and Safety:**\n- **UP** would lead to the board\u2019s edge which isn\u2019t ideal.\n- **RIGHT** is also the board\u2019s edge, which I need to avoid.\n- **LEFT** seems the most strategic move to align myself more centrally horizontally and prepare to head towards (7, 4).\n- **DOWN** would be a future move but starting towards our target cross-section.\n\n**Conclusion & Next Move:**\nTo progress towards the next apple while keeping safe from boundaries and considering future paths, let's move:\n\n**Decided Move: LEFT**"
