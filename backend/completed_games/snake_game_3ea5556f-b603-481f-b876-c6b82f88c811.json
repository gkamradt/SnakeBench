I\u2019ve successfully captured the apple at (7, 9), which now increases my score. \n\n### Board Analysis After the Last Move:\n- Current Position: (7, 9) after collecting the apple.\n- New Apple Situations: Previously, we had apples at (6, 3) and (0, 4), (6, 0), and (0, 1), and I could reach those from my current position in future turns.\n- Enemy Snake Information: Snake #2 is at (3, 0) with a body that occupies (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). They are quite far and do not pose an immediate threat.\n\n### Action Evaluation:\nNow that I'm at (7, 9):\n1. **Move UP to (7, 10)**: This is out of bounds and not permissible.\n2. **Move DOWN to (7, 8)**: This would be a backtrack to my previous position, meaning I would not progress towards any goals.\n3. **Move LEFT to (6, 9)**: This is currently empty, but does not advance towards an apple immediately.\n4. **Move RIGHT to (8, 9)**: This is also an empty space, but moves me horizontally towards columns where apples might still be.\n\n### Next Steps and Strategy:\nAlthough my immediate options don\u2019t lead directly to another apple, I need to position myself to reach (6, 3) for the next turn. Since moving DOWN or LEFT does not seem promising, I\u2019ll opt to move RIGHT to (8, 9) to remain flexible and available for my next moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- I will assess my next turn based on the positioning of the apples and the enemy; staying in an optimal position could allow me to gather apples on subsequent turns without creating risk.\n- My priority will remain on gathering apples while monitoring enemy movement.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

While the apple at (6, 3) is also in the same column, it is much further down.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake:** The enemy snake (Snake #2) is currently at (4, 1) and has a body segment at (4, 2). It doesn't pose an immediate threat since my current position (6, 8) is quite far from that area.\n\n3. **Available Moves:** From (6, 8), I can:\n   - Move UP to (6, 9), which keeps me in a safe area but does not get me closer to an apple.\n   - Move DOWN to (6, 7) is not viable because it's just backtracking to where I came from.\n   - Move LEFT to (5, 8), which keeps me away from immediate threats but doesn't advance towards apples.\n   - Move RIGHT to (7, 8), which is an open space and could potentially allow for further moves.\n\n### Evaluating Options:\n- **UP (to (6, 9))**: This is an empty space but doesn\u2019t progress towards apples.\n- **DOWN (to (6, 7))**: Backtracking and not an option.\n- **LEFT (to (5, 8))**: Moving away from potential apple collection.\n- **RIGHT (to (7, 8))**: This move brings me closer to the apple at (7, 9) on the next turn.\n\nGiven that moving RIGHT to (7, 8) not only keeps my options open but also sets me up to pick that apple at (7, 9) on my next move, it appears to be the best choice.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- My next priority should be to collect apples as efficiently as possible while avoiding areas where the enemy snake might move into play.

Therefore, I'll need to consider the longer terms strategically.\n\n### Forward Planning:\nI need to reach one of the apples, specifically targeting those that are within a couple of moves:\n- I'm ideally aiming for the apple at (6, 3) since it's closer compared to the apple at (0, 4) or others.\n- From my current position at (7, 9), one efficient route would be to navigate downward, aiming to reach (6, 3) in a few moves. \n\n### Best Move Choice:\n- Since moving DOWN to (7, 8) takes me back, and both LEFT to (6, 9) and RIGHT (8, 9) do not progress toward an apple, I must reconsider the immediate movements strategically. \n- My next feasible move is to go DOWN to (6, 8) where I can then plan to move one more step closer to (6, 3).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy moving DOWN, it keeps me onto a more advantageous track towards gathering apples.

Apples to consider based on proximity:\n   - (8, 1): One step away from moving to (8, 7).\n   - The other apples are further away or blocked due to the occupied spaces of the enemy snake (Snake #2) that extends from (4, 4) down to (0, 4).\n\n### Possible Moves from (7, 6):\n1. **UP (to 7, 7)**: Would reverse my last move and does not help in progressing toward the target.\n2. **DOWN (to 7, 5)**: Another empty position that maintains my strategic vertical alignment.\n3. **LEFT (to 6, 6)**: This position is empty, but again does not bring me closer to my target apple at (8, 1).\n4. **RIGHT (to 8, 6)**: An empty position, and provides a direct line towards the potential next move down.\n\n### Immediate Strategy:\n- While moving DOWN to (7, 5) would keep me in the current column, moving RIGHT to (8, 6) is a more beneficial move.\n- By positioning at (8, 6), I have a straight shot down to (8, 5) and could eventually access (8, 1).\n- I should also consider the threat from Snake #2 to ensure I don\u2019t end up placing my snake in a position where I might get cornered or cut off.\n\n### Decided Move:\nGiven the direct benefit of moving towards (8, 1) through (8, 6), the best option is to move **RIGHT** to (8, 6).\n\n### Final Move Decision:\nThe decided next move: **RIGHT**."
