The nearest apple to me is at (0, 7), which is directly above me. \n\nI should prioritize moving towards this apple. Moving up would put me at (0, 7), which gets me closer to the apple. Moving left would put me outside the board, which would result in my death. Moving right would put me at (1, 6), which I just came from. Moving down would put me at (0, 5), which gets me farther from the apple at (0, 7).\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns should be to continue collecting apples while keeping an eye on the other snake's movements to avoid potential collisions. After collecting the apple at (0, 7), I should consider my next target apple, possibly choosing between (5, 0) and (9, 1) or (9, 5) or (8, 5).\n\nFor now, I will move up to get the apple at (0, 7), as it is the closest apple to me and moving up doesn't put me in immediate danger of colliding with the other snake.\n\nNext turn, I should reassess the situation and consider my next target apple.\n\nNext move: UP"
