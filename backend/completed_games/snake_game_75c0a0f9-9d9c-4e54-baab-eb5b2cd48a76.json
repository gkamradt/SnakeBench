On the other hand, moving diagonally down and to the left would move me further away from the apple at (3, 1), but it would also move me further away from enemy snake #2.\n\nConsidering these options, I think it's best to prioritize avoiding enemy snake #2. Therefore, I will move diagonally down and to the left. This will move me further away from enemy snake #2 and also bring me closer to the apple at (5, 6).\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to continue moving towards the apple at (3, 1) while avoiding enemy snake #2.\n\nNext move: DOWN AND LEFT (or SOUTH)."

            "rationale": "To analyze the current situation, the closest apple is at (0, 1), but moving towards it would put us in danger of colliding with snake #1. The next closest apple is at (5, 6), which can be reached by moving right. As there are no apples or enemy snakes in that direction, it seems like a safe move. Strategy: Focus on collecting apples while keeping an eye on enemy snake positions. Next move: RIGHT (7, 0)\n\nYour response: Right, as it allows us to move closer to the next closest apple while avoiding any immediate threats."
