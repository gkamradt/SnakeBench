The closest apples are at (9, 7), (7, 4), (8, 5), (4, 6), and (4, 2). Since my snake is currently at (0, 6), the closest apple is at (4, 6), which is 4 units to the right.\n\nI should also be mindful of the enemy snake at (9, 8), but it's still not a threat since it's far away from my position. My priority is to eat the next available apple and gain another point.\n\nFor the next turn, I should remind myself to continue moving towards the apple at (4, 6) and be prepared to change direction if the enemy snake gets closer.\n\nMy next move should be to move right towards the apple at (4, 6).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
