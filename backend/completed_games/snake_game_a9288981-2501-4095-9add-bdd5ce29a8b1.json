            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,7). There are apples at (1,7), (0,3), (8,0), (2,1), and (5,2). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- At Y=7, X=1 there's an apple (A), and I'm at X=2, Y=7 (2), and enemy snake #1 is at X=8, Y=7 (1).\n\n- At Y=3, X=0 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=0, X=8 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=1, X=2 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=2, X=5 there's an apple.\n\n- And there are some other empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,7). That's right next to me, only one step to the left.\n\nBut if I go left to (1,7), I'll eat it and grow longer. But then, I need to think about where to go next. After eating that apple, I would be at (1,7), and I need to consider the next apple to go for.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,3), which is quite far down and to the left. That seems like a lot of steps, and I might run into the enemy snake or walls in the process.\n\nThere's also an apple at (8,0), which is far to the right and down. Again, that's a long way, and the enemy snake is at (8,7), so maybe it's heading towards that apple as well.\n\nThere's an apple at (2,1), which is directly below me, though quite a few rows down. That might be a reasonable target.\n\nAnd another at (5,2), which is to the right and down a bit.\n\nI need to prioritize which one to go for first. Maybe I should go for the closest one, which is (1,7), and then decide where to go next based on that.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. It's at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, far to the right.\n\nIf I go left to (1,7), I need to consider if the enemy snake might move towards me or not. Since it's far away, maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll be longer, so I need to make sure I have space to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down towards (2,1), which is directly below me.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,7): distance is 1 step left.\n\n- (0,3): distance is 2 steps left and 4 steps down (total 6 steps).\n\n- (8,0): distance is 6 steps right and 7 steps down (total 13 steps).\n\n- (2,1): distance is 6 steps down.\n\n- (5,2): distance is 3 steps right and 5 steps down (total 8 steps).\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7), followed by (2,1), then (5,2), then (0,3), and finally (8,0).\n\nI think I should go for (1,7) first, since it's right next to me.\n\nBut wait, if I go left to (1,7), I eat the apple and grow longer. Then, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nIf I continue left from (1,7), I'd be at (0,7). From there, I could go down towards (0,3), but that seems a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down towards (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (2,1).\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nWait, what are the boundaries again? The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). So, X can be from 0 to 9, Y from 0 to 9.\n\nI need to make sure I don't go outside these limits.\n\nAlso, I need to remember that growing longer means my tail will extend, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, I'm just the head at (2,7), so no tail to worry about yet.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll have a tail segment at (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my tail will be at (1,7).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you move, the tail stays where it is until the new head is placed.\n\nWait, in Snake games, when you move, the tail stays in place unless you grow.\n\nSo, if I move left from (2,7) to (1,7) and eat the apple, my tail remains at (2,7), and I grow an additional segment.\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move left from (1,7) to (0,7), my tail still stays at (2,7), and the second segment moves to (1,7).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you grow, your tail stays extended.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,7), my snake will be:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my snake becomes:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or the wall or another snake.\n\nSo, if I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go left to (0,7), that's fine.\n\nFrom (0,7), I could then go down to (0,6), then (0,5), and so on, towards (0,3).\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (2,1).\n\nWait, but (2,1) is below my current position, at X=2, Y=1.\n\nFrom (1,7), going down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at X=2, Y=1, so I need to move right from (1,1) to (2,1).\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any apples in between that I might want to pick up first.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,7), and I'm at (2,7). It might move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to prioritize apples that are closer to me and less likely to be contested by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, so I should probably go for that first.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide whether to go for (2,1) or (0,3).\n\nLet's say I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) to eat that apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (2,1) directly.\n\nFrom (2,7), I can go down to (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1).\n\nThat's a straight path down to the apple at (2,1).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, there don't seem to be any apples or snakes in that column, so it should be safe.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, at X=8, Y=7.\n\nIf it moves left towards me, I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, it's far away, so maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that moving down towards (2,1) might put me in the path of the enemy snake if it decides to move down as well.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apple at (0,3) might be a safer option, but it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the potential points I can gain by going for certain apples"

Okay, so I need to make sure I'm looking at the current position, which is (2,6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apples are at (1,7), (0,3), (8,0), (2,1), and (5,2).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (8,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,6), and I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me think about the apples nearby.\n\nThe apple at (1,7) is up and to the left from my current position. That's one step up to (2,7), then one step left to (1,7).\n\nBut wait, in the last move, I was at (2,7), moved down to (2,6). So, to get to (1,7), I need to move up to (2,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,6). It's quite far away, but I need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,1), which is directly below me. I can move down to it.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,7): up 1 to (2,7), then left 1 to (1,7), total 2 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): down 5 steps to (2,1), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (0,3): left 2 to (0,6), then down 3 to (0,3), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (5,2): right 3 to (5,6), then down 4 to (5,2), total 7 steps.\n\n- To (8,0): right 6 to (8,6), then down 6 to (8,0), total 12 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7) at 2 steps.\n\nBut I need to consider potential conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), then left to (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away. It would take them several moves to reach me, so I should be safe for now.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I have a path to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nCurrently, I'm at (2,6). If I move up to (2,7), then left to (1,7), my tail will be at (2,6).\n\nThen, if I move down from (1,7) to (1,6), my tail moves to (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,6), my tail moves to (1,7), and so on.\n\nWait, I need to be careful not to move into my own tail.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you move, your tail stays where it is until the new head is placed. So, after eating the apple, your tail extends.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nStarting at (2,6).\n\nMove up to (2,7), eat apple at (1,7). Now, my snake is:\n\n- Head at (2,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,6)\n\nThen, move left to (1,7). Now:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Previous head at (2,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,6)\n\nThen, move down to (1,6):\n\n- Head at (1,6)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into any of these positions.\n\nSeems manageable for now.\n\nAlternatively, going directly down to (2,1) might be safer, but it's farther.\n\nI need to balance between getting the closest apple and avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (8,6). It could move left towards me or down towards (8,0).\n\nIf it moves left, it would have to cover a lot of ground to reach me, which gives me time to get the apple and position myself.\n\nIf it moves down towards (8,0), that might be a different strategy.\n\nI need to assume the enemy is trying to get to the apple at (8,0), but it's far away.\n\nSo, for now, I think it's safe to go for the apple at (1,7).\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating (1,7), there might be other apples I can reach easily.\n\nFor example, from (1,7), I can go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) for another apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in that path, so it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go left to (0,7), then down to (0,3), but that's a longer path.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Path to (2,1): down from (1,7) to (1,1), then right to (2,1)\n\n- Path to (0,3): left from (1,7) to (0,7), then down to (0,3)\n\nThe path to (2,1) is shorter, only 6 steps down and then right, total 7 steps.\n\nPath to (0,3) is 1 step left and 4 down, total 5 steps.\n\nBut from (1,7), the path to (0,3) is shorter, but I might want to prioritize the apple at (2,1) because it's closer to my current position.\n\nWait, no, from (1,7), (0,3) is closer than (2,1).\n\nWait, from (1,7):\n\n- To (0,3): left 1 to (0,7), then down 4 to (0,3), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): right 1 to (2,7), then down 6 to (2,1), total 7 steps.\n\nSo, (0,3) is closer from (1,7).\n\nBut I need to consider the entire path from my current position.\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\n- To (1,7): up 1 to (2,7), left 1 to (1,7), then to (0,3): left 1 to (0,7), down 4 to (0,3), total 7 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): down 5 to (2,1), total 5 steps.\n\nWait, directly down to (2,1) is only 5 steps, whereas going via (1,7) and then to (0,3) is 7 steps.\n\nSo, maybe going directly down to (2,1) is better in terms of steps.\n\nBut then, there's an apple at (1,7) right next to me. It might be better to grab that first and gain the point and the length.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that growing longer might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut in this case, the board is 10x10, and I'm starting small, so length shouldn't be a big issue yet.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the enemy snake. If I go for (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away, so it should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (2,1), the enemy is at (8,6), which is also far away.\n\nBut perhaps going down towards (2,1) might put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off if it moves down towards (8,0).\n\nWait, but (8,0) is at X=8, Y=0, which is down and to the right from the enemy's current position.\n\nIf the enemy moves down towards (8,0), I can move down towards (2,1), and we're moving in opposite directions, so unlikely to collide.\n\nUnless the enemy changes its path.\n\nBut since it's a snake game, and assuming the enemy is trying to maximize its score as well, it might go for the closest apple, which for it would be (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe for me to go down towards (2,1).\n\nBut, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, and I can get it quickly.\n\nLet me think about the time it would take.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), left to (1,7), eat the apple, then down to (1,6), (1,5), ..., (1,1), then right to (2,1), that's a total of 2 + 5 +1 = 8 steps.\n\nVersus going directly down to ("

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,7). There are apples at (1,7), (0,3), (8,0), (2,1), and (5,2). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- At Y=7, X=1 there's an apple (A), and I'm at X=2, Y=7 (2), and enemy snake #1 is at X=8, Y=7 (1).\n\n- At Y=3, X=0 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=0, X=8 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=1, X=2 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=2, X=5 there's an apple.\n\n- And there are some other empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,7). That's right next to me, only one step to the left.\n\nBut if I go left to (1,7), I'll eat it and grow longer. But then, I need to think about where to go next. After eating that apple, I would be at (1,7), and I need to consider the next apple to go for.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,3), which is quite far down and to the left. That seems like a lot of steps, and I might run into the enemy snake or walls in the process.\n\nThere's also an apple at (8,0), which is far to the right and down. Again, that's a long way, and the enemy snake is at (8,7), so maybe it's heading towards that apple as well.\n\nThere's an apple at (2,1), which is directly below me, though quite a few rows down. That might be a reasonable target.\n\nAnd another at (5,2), which is to the right and down a bit.\n\nI need to prioritize which one to go for first. Maybe I should go for the closest one, which is (1,7), and then decide where to go next based on that.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. It's at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, far to the right.\n\nIf I go left to (1,7), I need to consider if the enemy snake might move towards me or not. Since it's far away, maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll be longer, so I need to make sure I have space to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down towards (2,1), which is directly below me.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,7): distance is 1 step left.\n\n- (0,3): distance is 2 steps left and 4 steps down (total 6 steps).\n\n- (8,0): distance is 6 steps right and 7 steps down (total 13 steps).\n\n- (2,1): distance is 6 steps down.\n\n- (5,2): distance is 3 steps right and 5 steps down (total 8 steps).\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7), followed by (2,1), then (5,2), then (0,3), and finally (8,0).\n\nI think I should go for (1,7) first, since it's right next to me.\n\nBut wait, if I go left to (1,7), I eat the apple and grow longer. Then, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nIf I continue left from (1,7), I'd be at (0,7). From there, I could go down towards (0,3), but that seems a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down towards (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (2,1).\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nWait, what are the boundaries again? The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). So, X can be from 0 to 9, Y from 0 to 9.\n\nI need to make sure I don't go outside these limits.\n\nAlso, I need to remember that growing longer means my tail will extend, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, I'm just the head at (2,7), so no tail to worry about yet.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll have a tail segment at (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my tail will be at (1,7).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you move, the tail stays where it is until the new head is placed.\n\nWait, in Snake games, when you move, the tail stays in place unless you grow.\n\nSo, if I move left from (2,7) to (1,7) and eat the apple, my tail remains at (2,7), and I grow an additional segment.\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move left from (1,7) to (0,7), my tail still stays at (2,7), and the second segment moves to (1,7).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you grow, your tail stays extended.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,7), my snake will be:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my snake becomes:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or the wall or another snake.\n\nSo, if I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go left to (0,7), that's fine.\n\nFrom (0,7), I could then go down to (0,6), then (0,5), and so on, towards (0,3).\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (2,1).\n\nWait, but (2,1) is below my current position, at X=2, Y=1.\n\nFrom (1,7), going down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at X=2, Y=1, so I need to move right from (1,1) to (2,1).\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any apples in between that I might want to pick up first.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,7), and I'm at (2,7). It might move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to prioritize apples that are closer to me and less likely to be contested by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, so I should probably go for that first.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide whether to go for (2,1) or (0,3).\n\nLet's say I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) to eat that apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (2,1) directly.\n\nFrom (2,7), I can go down to (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1).\n\nThat's a straight path down to the apple at (2,1).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, there don't seem to be any apples or snakes in that column, so it should be safe.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, at X=8, Y=7.\n\nIf it moves left towards me, I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, it's far away, so maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that moving down towards (2,1) might put me in the path of the enemy snake if it decides to move down as well.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apple at (0,3) might be a safer option, but it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the potential points I can gain by going for certain apples"

If I go for (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away, so it should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (2,1), the enemy is at (8,6), which is also far away.\n\nBut perhaps going down towards (2,1) might put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off if it moves down towards (8,0).\n\nWait, but (8,0) is at X=8, Y=0, which is down and to the right from the enemy's current position.\n\nIf the enemy moves down towards (8,0), I can move down towards (2,1), and we're moving in opposite directions, so unlikely to collide.\n\nUnless the enemy changes its path.\n\nBut since it's a snake game, and assuming the enemy is trying to maximize its score as well, it might go for the closest apple, which for it would be (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe for me to go down towards (2,1).\n\nBut, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, and I can get it quickly.\n\nLet me think about the time it would take.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), left to (1,7), eat the apple, then down to (1,6), (1,5), ..., (1,1), then right to (2,1), that's a total of 2 + 5 +1 = 8 steps.\n\nVersus going directly down to ("

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, I'm controlling Snake ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,5). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right.\n\nFirst, let's look at the positions of the apples:\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (8,0)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (5,2)\n\nAnd there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at position (7,6), with no body parts listed, so it's just the head for now.\n\nOkay, so I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me think about the apples and their distances from my current position.\n\nStarting with the apple at (1,7):\n\n- From (2,5), moving up to (2,6), then (2,7), then left to (1,7). That's three moves: up, up, left.\n\nWait, actually, from (2,5), to (2,6) is up, then (2,7) is another up, then left to (1,7). So, two ups and one left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,7): |2-1| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (0,3): |2-0| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (8,0): |2-8| + |5-0| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (2,1): |2-2| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- (5,2): |2-5| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7) with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest are (0,3) and (2,1), both with a distance of 4.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,6), which is fairly far from my current position.\n\nI need to consider the paths to these apples and see if any of them might lead me into danger or into the path of the enemy snake.\n\nLet's consider the path to (1,7):\n\nFrom (2,5):\n\n- Up to (2,6)\n\n- Up to (2,7)\n\n- Left to (1,7)\n\nThat seems straightforward. No immediate obstacles.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), my snake will grow longer, so I need to make sure that I have a clear path\u7ee7\u7eed\u524d\u8fdb without running into myself.\n\nLet me think about the next steps after eating (1,7):\n\n- From (1,7), I could go left to (0,7), then down to (0,6), (0,5), etc., but I don't see any immediate apples in that direction.\n\n- Alternatively, from (1,7), I could go down to (1,6), then to (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (1,1), but that's another apple at (2,1), which is a bit far.\n\nWait, (2,1) is directly below my current position. So, maybe I should consider going directly down to (2,1).\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nFrom (2,5):\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\nThat's four moves down.\n\nBut compared to going to (1,7) in three moves, that's longer.\n\nAlso, while going down, I might get too close to the enemy snake, which is at (7,6).\n\nAlthough it's currently far, I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (0,3).\n\nFrom (2,5):\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\n- Left to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Down to (0,3)\n\nThat's four moves as well.\n\nNot sure if that's better than going to (1,7).\n\nWait, but (1,7) is closer with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nLet me consider the potential paths and see which one gives me access to more apples.\n\nIf I go to (1,7), eat the apple, then maybe go to (0,3), which is left and down.\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Left to (0,7)\n\n- Down to (0,6)\n\n- Down to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Down to (0,3)\n\nThat's a total of 1 + 4 = 5 moves after eating (1,7), so overall 3 + 5 = 8 moves from my current position.\n\nAlternatively, going directly to (0,3):\n\nFrom (2,5):\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\n- Left to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Down to (0,3)\n\nThat's 2 + 2 = 4 moves.\n\nWait, that's better than the 8 moves if I go to (1,7) and then to (0,3).\n\nSo maybe going directly to (0,3) is a better strategy.\n\nBut, the apple at (1,7) is closer, and I can get it faster.\n\nAfter eating (1,7), I can consider going to (0,3), but it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the closer apple and go for (1,7) first.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nIf I go to (1,7), the enemy is at (7,6), which is far away, so it's unlikely to interfere with me immediately.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't box myself in or create a situation where I can't maneuver properly after growing in size.\n\nLet me think about my snake's length.\n\nInitially, I assume my snake is just one block since no body parts are mentioned.\n\nAfter eating an apple, I grow by one block.\n\nSo, after eating (1,7), my snake will be two blocks long.\n\nI need to ensure that I have enough space to move without hitting my own tail.\n\nIn this case, on a 10x10 board, with only one enemy snake far away, it should be manageable.\n\nAnother consideration is that perhaps I can go for the apple at (2,1), which is directly below me.\n\nFrom (2,5):\n\n- Down to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\nThat's four moves down.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), I can consider moving up to get other apples.\n\nBut, compared to going to (1,7) in three moves, it's slower.\n\nAlso, the apple at (2,1) is directly below me, so it might be easier to get after getting (1,7).\n\nWait, actually, after getting (1,7), I can consider moving down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and then right to (2,2), up to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (5,2), which is another apple.\n\nFrom (2,5):\n\n- Right to (3,5)\n\n- Right to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Down to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\nThat's 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nWhich is longer than going to (1,7).\n\nSo, again, (1,7) seems the most attractive option.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,3), which is closer than (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,5):\n\n- Left to (1,5)\n\n- Left to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Down to (0,3)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nStill, going to (1,7) in three moves is faster.\n\nI think the best strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is (1,7), and then proceed from there.\n\nAfter eating (1,7), I can consider which apple to go for next based on the new board state.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movements.\n\nBut for now, with the enemy being far away, I should be safe.\n\nSo, my plan is to move up to (2,6), then up to (2,7), then left to (1,7) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can assess the situation and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with moving up to (2,6).\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,7). There are apples at (1,7), (0,3), (8,0), (2,1), and (5,2). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- At Y=7, X=1 there's an apple (A), and I'm at X=2, Y=7 (2), and enemy snake #1 is at X=8, Y=7 (1).\n\n- At Y=3, X=0 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=0, X=8 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=1, X=2 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=2, X=5 there's an apple.\n\n- And there are some other empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,7). That's right next to me, only one step to the left.\n\nBut if I go left to (1,7), I'll eat it and grow longer. But then, I need to think about where to go next. After eating that apple, I would be at (1,7), and I need to consider the next apple to go for.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,3), which is quite far down and to the left. That seems like a lot of steps, and I might run into the enemy snake or walls in the process.\n\nThere's also an apple at (8,0), which is far to the right and down. Again, that's a long way, and the enemy snake is at (8,7), so maybe it's heading towards that apple as well.\n\nThere's an apple at (2,1), which is directly below me, though quite a few rows down. That might be a reasonable target.\n\nAnd another at (5,2), which is to the right and down a bit.\n\nI need to prioritize which one to go for first. Maybe I should go for the closest one, which is (1,7), and then decide where to go next based on that.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. It's at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, far to the right.\n\nIf I go left to (1,7), I need to consider if the enemy snake might move towards me or not. Since it's far away, maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll be longer, so I need to make sure I have space to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down towards (2,1), which is directly below me.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,7): distance is 1 step left.\n\n- (0,3): distance is 2 steps left and 4 steps down (total 6 steps).\n\n- (8,0): distance is 6 steps right and 7 steps down (total 13 steps).\n\n- (2,1): distance is 6 steps down.\n\n- (5,2): distance is 3 steps right and 5 steps down (total 8 steps).\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7), followed by (2,1), then (5,2), then (0,3), and finally (8,0).\n\nI think I should go for (1,7) first, since it's right next to me.\n\nBut wait, if I go left to (1,7), I eat the apple and grow longer. Then, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nIf I continue left from (1,7), I'd be at (0,7). From there, I could go down towards (0,3), but that seems a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down towards (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (2,1).\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nWait, what are the boundaries again? The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). So, X can be from 0 to 9, Y from 0 to 9.\n\nI need to make sure I don't go outside these limits.\n\nAlso, I need to remember that growing longer means my tail will extend, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, I'm just the head at (2,7), so no tail to worry about yet.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll have a tail segment at (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my tail will be at (1,7).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you move, the tail stays where it is until the new head is placed.\n\nWait, in Snake games, when you move, the tail stays in place unless you grow.\n\nSo, if I move left from (2,7) to (1,7) and eat the apple, my tail remains at (2,7), and I grow an additional segment.\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move left from (1,7) to (0,7), my tail still stays at (2,7), and the second segment moves to (1,7).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you grow, your tail stays extended.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,7), my snake will be:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my snake becomes:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or the wall or another snake.\n\nSo, if I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go left to (0,7), that's fine.\n\nFrom (0,7), I could then go down to (0,6), then (0,5), and so on, towards (0,3).\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (2,1).\n\nWait, but (2,1) is below my current position, at X=2, Y=1.\n\nFrom (1,7), going down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at X=2, Y=1, so I need to move right from (1,1) to (2,1).\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any apples in between that I might want to pick up first.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,7), and I'm at (2,7). It might move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to prioritize apples that are closer to me and less likely to be contested by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, so I should probably go for that first.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide whether to go for (2,1) or (0,3).\n\nLet's say I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) to eat that apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (2,1) directly.\n\nFrom (2,7), I can go down to (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1).\n\nThat's a straight path down to the apple at (2,1).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, there don't seem to be any apples or snakes in that column, so it should be safe.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, at X=8, Y=7.\n\nIf it moves left towards me, I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, it's far away, so maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that moving down towards (2,1) might put me in the path of the enemy snake if it decides to move down as well.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apple at (0,3) might be a safer option, but it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the potential points I can gain by going for certain apples"

I can move down to it.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,7): up 1 to (2,7), then left 1 to (1,7), total 2 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): down 5 steps to (2,1), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (0,3): left 2 to (0,6), then down 3 to (0,3), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (5,2): right 3 to (5,6), then down 4 to (5,2), total 7 steps.\n\n- To (8,0): right 6 to (8,6), then down 6 to (8,0), total 12 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7) at 2 steps.\n\nBut I need to consider potential conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), then left to (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away. It would take them several moves to reach me, so I should be safe for now.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I have a path to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nCurrently, I'm at (2,6). If I move up to (2,7), then left to (1,7), my tail will be at (2,6).\n\nThen, if I move down from (1,7) to (1,6), my tail moves to (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,6), my tail moves to (1,7), and so on.\n\nWait, I need to be careful not to move into my own tail.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you move, your tail stays where it is until the new head is placed. So, after eating the apple, your tail extends.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nStarting at (2,6).\n\nMove up to (2,7), eat apple at (1,7). Now, my snake is:\n\n- Head at (2,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,6)\n\nThen, move left to (1,7). Now:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Previous head at (2,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,6)\n\nThen, move down to (1,6):\n\n- Head at (1,6)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into any of these positions.\n\nSeems manageable for now.\n\nAlternatively, going directly down to (2,1) might be safer, but it's farther.\n\nI need to balance between getting the closest apple and avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (8,6). It could move left towards me or down towards (8,0).\n\nIf it moves left, it would have to cover a lot of ground to reach me, which gives me time to get the apple and position myself.\n\nIf it moves down towards (8,0), that might be a different strategy.\n\nI need to assume the enemy is trying to get to the apple at (8,0), but it's far away.\n\nSo, for now, I think it's safe to go for the apple at (1,7).\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating (1,7), there might be other apples I can reach easily.\n\nFor example, from (1,7), I can go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) for another apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in that path, so it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go left to (0,7), then down to (0,3), but that's a longer path.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Path to (2,1): down from (1,7) to (1,1), then right to (2,1)\n\n- Path to (0,3): left from (1,7) to (0,7), then down to (0,3)\n\nThe path to (2,1) is shorter, only 6 steps down and then right, total 7 steps.\n\nPath to (0,3) is 1 step left and 4 down, total 5 steps.\n\nBut from (1,7), the path to (0,3) is shorter, but I might want to prioritize the apple at (2,1) because it's closer to my current position.\n\nWait, no, from (1,7), (0,3) is closer than (2,1).\n\nWait, from (1,7):\n\n- To (0,3): left 1 to (0,7), then down 4 to (0,3), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): right 1 to (2,7), then down 6 to (2,1), total 7 steps.\n\nSo, (0,3) is closer from (1,7).\n\nBut I need to consider the entire path from my current position.\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\n- To (1,7): up 1 to (2,7), left 1 to (1,7), then to (0,3): left 1 to (0,7), down 4 to (0,3), total 7 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): down 5 to (2,1), total 5 steps.\n\nWait, directly down to (2,1) is only 5 steps, whereas going via (1,7) and then to (0,3) is 7 steps.\n\nSo, maybe going directly down to (2,1) is better in terms of steps.\n\nBut then, there's an apple at (1,7) right next to me. It might be better to grab that first and gain the point and the length.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that growing longer might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut in this case, the board is 10x10, and I'm starting small, so length shouldn't be a big issue yet.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the enemy snake. If I go for (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away, so it should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (2,1), the enemy is at (8,6), which is also far away.\n\nBut perhaps going down towards (2,1) might put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off if it moves down towards (8,0).\n\nWait, but (8,0) is at X=8, Y=0, which is down and to the right from the enemy's current position.\n\nIf the enemy moves down towards (8,0), I can move down towards (2,1), and we're moving in opposite directions, so unlikely to collide.\n\nUnless the enemy changes its path.\n\nBut since it's a snake game, and assuming the enemy is trying to maximize its score as well, it might go for the closest apple, which for it would be (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe for me to go down towards (2,1).\n\nBut, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, and I can get it quickly.\n\nLet me think about the time it would take.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), left to (1,7), eat the apple, then down to (1,6), (1,5), ..., (1,1), then right to (2,1), that's a total of 2 + 5 +1 = 8 steps.\n\nVersus going directly down to ("

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,7). There are apples at (1,7), (0,3), (8,0), (2,1), and (5,2). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- At Y=7, X=1 there's an apple (A), and I'm at X=2, Y=7 (2), and enemy snake #1 is at X=8, Y=7 (1).\n\n- At Y=3, X=0 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=0, X=8 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=1, X=2 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=2, X=5 there's an apple.\n\n- And there are some other empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,7). That's right next to me, only one step to the left.\n\nBut if I go left to (1,7), I'll eat it and grow longer. But then, I need to think about where to go next. After eating that apple, I would be at (1,7), and I need to consider the next apple to go for.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,3), which is quite far down and to the left. That seems like a lot of steps, and I might run into the enemy snake or walls in the process.\n\nThere's also an apple at (8,0), which is far to the right and down. Again, that's a long way, and the enemy snake is at (8,7), so maybe it's heading towards that apple as well.\n\nThere's an apple at (2,1), which is directly below me, though quite a few rows down. That might be a reasonable target.\n\nAnd another at (5,2), which is to the right and down a bit.\n\nI need to prioritize which one to go for first. Maybe I should go for the closest one, which is (1,7), and then decide where to go next based on that.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. It's at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, far to the right.\n\nIf I go left to (1,7), I need to consider if the enemy snake might move towards me or not. Since it's far away, maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll be longer, so I need to make sure I have space to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down towards (2,1), which is directly below me.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,7): distance is 1 step left.\n\n- (0,3): distance is 2 steps left and 4 steps down (total 6 steps).\n\n- (8,0): distance is 6 steps right and 7 steps down (total 13 steps).\n\n- (2,1): distance is 6 steps down.\n\n- (5,2): distance is 3 steps right and 5 steps down (total 8 steps).\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7), followed by (2,1), then (5,2), then (0,3), and finally (8,0).\n\nI think I should go for (1,7) first, since it's right next to me.\n\nBut wait, if I go left to (1,7), I eat the apple and grow longer. Then, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nIf I continue left from (1,7), I'd be at (0,7). From there, I could go down towards (0,3), but that seems a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down towards (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (2,1).\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nWait, what are the boundaries again? The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). So, X can be from 0 to 9, Y from 0 to 9.\n\nI need to make sure I don't go outside these limits.\n\nAlso, I need to remember that growing longer means my tail will extend, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, I'm just the head at (2,7), so no tail to worry about yet.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll have a tail segment at (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my tail will be at (1,7).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you move, the tail stays where it is until the new head is placed.\n\nWait, in Snake games, when you move, the tail stays in place unless you grow.\n\nSo, if I move left from (2,7) to (1,7) and eat the apple, my tail remains at (2,7), and I grow an additional segment.\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move left from (1,7) to (0,7), my tail still stays at (2,7), and the second segment moves to (1,7).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you grow, your tail stays extended.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,7), my snake will be:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my snake becomes:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or the wall or another snake.\n\nSo, if I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go left to (0,7), that's fine.\n\nFrom (0,7), I could then go down to (0,6), then (0,5), and so on, towards (0,3).\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (2,1).\n\nWait, but (2,1) is below my current position, at X=2, Y=1.\n\nFrom (1,7), going down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at X=2, Y=1, so I need to move right from (1,1) to (2,1).\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any apples in between that I might want to pick up first.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,7), and I'm at (2,7). It might move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to prioritize apples that are closer to me and less likely to be contested by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, so I should probably go for that first.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide whether to go for (2,1) or (0,3).\n\nLet's say I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) to eat that apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (2,1) directly.\n\nFrom (2,7), I can go down to (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1).\n\nThat's a straight path down to the apple at (2,1).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, there don't seem to be any apples or snakes in that column, so it should be safe.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, at X=8, Y=7.\n\nIf it moves left towards me, I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, it's far away, so maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that moving down towards (2,1) might put me in the path of the enemy snake if it decides to move down as well.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apple at (0,3) might be a safer option, but it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the potential points I can gain by going for certain apples"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,6). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (2,7), but in the current board state, it shows me at (2,6). Hmm, maybe I moved down from (2,7) to (2,6) in the last turn. Okay, so I need to make sure I'm looking at the current position, which is (2,6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apples are at (1,7), (0,3), (8,0), (2,1), and (5,2).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (8,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,6), and I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me think about the apples nearby.\n\nThe apple at (1,7) is up and to the left from my current position. That's one step up to (2,7), then one step left to (1,7).\n\nBut wait, in the last move, I was at (2,7), moved down to (2,6). So, to get to (1,7), I need to move up to (2,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,6). It's quite far away, but I need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,1), which is directly below me. I can move down to it.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,7): up 1 to (2,7), then left 1 to (1,7), total 2 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): down 5 steps to (2,1), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (0,3): left 2 to (0,6), then down 3 to (0,3), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (5,2): right 3 to (5,6), then down 4 to (5,2), total 7 steps.\n\n- To (8,0): right 6 to (8,6), then down 6 to (8,0), total 12 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7) at 2 steps.\n\nBut I need to consider potential conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), then left to (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away. It would take them several moves to reach me, so I should be safe for now.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I have a path to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nCurrently, I'm at (2,6). If I move up to (2,7), then left to (1,7), my tail will be at (2,6).\n\nThen, if I move down from (1,7) to (1,6), my tail moves to (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,6), my tail moves to (1,7), and so on.\n\nWait, I need to be careful not to move into my own tail.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you move, your tail stays where it is until the new head is placed. So, after eating the apple, your tail extends.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nStarting at (2,6).\n\nMove up to (2,7), eat apple at (1,7). Now, my snake is:\n\n- Head at (2,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,6)\n\nThen, move left to (1,7). Now:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Previous head at (2,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,6)\n\nThen, move down to (1,6):\n\n- Head at (1,6)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into any of these positions.\n\nSeems manageable for now.\n\nAlternatively, going directly down to (2,1) might be safer, but it's farther.\n\nI need to balance between getting the closest apple and avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (8,6). It could move left towards me or down towards (8,0).\n\nIf it moves left, it would have to cover a lot of ground to reach me, which gives me time to get the apple and position myself.\n\nIf it moves down towards (8,0), that might be a different strategy.\n\nI need to assume the enemy is trying to get to the apple at (8,0), but it's far away.\n\nSo, for now, I think it's safe to go for the apple at (1,7).\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating (1,7), there might be other apples I can reach easily.\n\nFor example, from (1,7), I can go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) for another apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in that path, so it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go left to (0,7), then down to (0,3), but that's a longer path.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Path to (2,1): down from (1,7) to (1,1), then right to (2,1)\n\n- Path to (0,3): left from (1,7) to (0,7), then down to (0,3)\n\nThe path to (2,1) is shorter, only 6 steps down and then right, total 7 steps.\n\nPath to (0,3) is 1 step left and 4 down, total 5 steps.\n\nBut from (1,7), the path to (0,3) is shorter, but I might want to prioritize the apple at (2,1) because it's closer to my current position.\n\nWait, no, from (1,7), (0,3) is closer than (2,1).\n\nWait, from (1,7):\n\n- To (0,3): left 1 to (0,7), then down 4 to (0,3), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): right 1 to (2,7), then down 6 to (2,1), total 7 steps.\n\nSo, (0,3) is closer from (1,7).\n\nBut I need to consider the entire path from my current position.\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\n- To (1,7): up 1 to (2,7), left 1 to (1,7), then to (0,3): left 1 to (0,7), down 4 to (0,3), total 7 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): down 5 to (2,1), total 5 steps.\n\nWait, directly down to (2,1) is only 5 steps, whereas going via (1,7) and then to (0,3) is 7 steps.\n\nSo, maybe going directly down to (2,1) is better in terms of steps.\n\nBut then, there's an apple at (1,7) right next to me. It might be better to grab that first and gain the point and the length.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that growing longer might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut in this case, the board is 10x10, and I'm starting small, so length shouldn't be a big issue yet.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the enemy snake. If I go for (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away, so it should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (2,1), the enemy is at (8,6), which is also far away.\n\nBut perhaps going down towards (2,1) might put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off if it moves down towards (8,0).\n\nWait, but (8,0) is at X=8, Y=0, which is down and to the right from the enemy's current position.\n\nIf the enemy moves down towards (8,0), I can move down towards (2,1), and we're moving in opposite directions, so unlikely to collide.\n\nUnless the enemy changes its path.\n\nBut since it's a snake game, and assuming the enemy is trying to maximize its score as well, it might go for the closest apple, which for it would be (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe for me to go down towards (2,1).\n\nBut, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, and I can get it quickly.\n\nLet me think about the time it would take.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), left to (1,7), eat the apple, then down to (1,6), (1,5), ..., (1,1), then right to (2,1), that's a total of 2 + 5 +1 = 8 steps.\n\nVersus going directly down to ("

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,7). There are apples at (1,7), (0,3), (8,0), (2,1), and (5,2). Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- At Y=7, X=1 there's an apple (A), and I'm at X=2, Y=7 (2), and enemy snake #1 is at X=8, Y=7 (1).\n\n- At Y=3, X=0 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=0, X=8 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=1, X=2 there's an apple.\n\n- At Y=2, X=5 there's an apple.\n\n- And there are some other empty spaces.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apple at (1,7). That's right next to me, only one step to the left.\n\nBut if I go left to (1,7), I'll eat it and grow longer. But then, I need to think about where to go next. After eating that apple, I would be at (1,7), and I need to consider the next apple to go for.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,3), which is quite far down and to the left. That seems like a lot of steps, and I might run into the enemy snake or walls in the process.\n\nThere's also an apple at (8,0), which is far to the right and down. Again, that's a long way, and the enemy snake is at (8,7), so maybe it's heading towards that apple as well.\n\nThere's an apple at (2,1), which is directly below me, though quite a few rows down. That might be a reasonable target.\n\nAnd another at (5,2), which is to the right and down a bit.\n\nI need to prioritize which one to go for first. Maybe I should go for the closest one, which is (1,7), and then decide where to go next based on that.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. It's at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, far to the right.\n\nIf I go left to (1,7), I need to consider if the enemy snake might move towards me or not. Since it's far away, maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll be longer, so I need to make sure I have space to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down towards (2,1), which is directly below me.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to each apple:\n\n- (1,7): distance is 1 step left.\n\n- (0,3): distance is 2 steps left and 4 steps down (total 6 steps).\n\n- (8,0): distance is 6 steps right and 7 steps down (total 13 steps).\n\n- (2,1): distance is 6 steps down.\n\n- (5,2): distance is 3 steps right and 5 steps down (total 8 steps).\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7), followed by (2,1), then (5,2), then (0,3), and finally (8,0).\n\nI think I should go for (1,7) first, since it's right next to me.\n\nBut wait, if I go left to (1,7), I eat the apple and grow longer. Then, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nIf I continue left from (1,7), I'd be at (0,7). From there, I could go down towards (0,3), but that seems a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down towards (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (2,1).\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nWait, what are the boundaries again? The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). So, X can be from 0 to 9, Y from 0 to 9.\n\nI need to make sure I don't go outside these limits.\n\nAlso, I need to remember that growing longer means my tail will extend, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut right now, I'm just the head at (2,7), so no tail to worry about yet.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll have a tail segment at (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my tail will be at (1,7).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you move, the tail stays where it is until the new head is placed.\n\nWait, in Snake games, when you move, the tail stays in place unless you grow.\n\nSo, if I move left from (2,7) to (1,7) and eat the apple, my tail remains at (2,7), and I grow an additional segment.\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move left from (1,7) to (0,7), my tail still stays at (2,7), and the second segment moves to (1,7).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you grow, your tail stays extended.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,7), my snake will be:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,7), my snake becomes:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail or the wall or another snake.\n\nSo, if I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go left to (0,7), that's fine.\n\nFrom (0,7), I could then go down to (0,6), then (0,5), and so on, towards (0,3).\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (2,1).\n\nWait, but (2,1) is below my current position, at X=2, Y=1.\n\nFrom (1,7), going down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at X=2, Y=1, so I need to move right from (1,1) to (2,1).\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any apples in between that I might want to pick up first.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,7), and I'm at (2,7). It might move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to prioritize apples that are closer to me and less likely to be contested by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, so I should probably go for that first.\n\nAfter eating that, I can decide whether to go for (2,1) or (0,3).\n\nLet's say I go left to (1,7), eat the apple, then go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) to eat that apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any walls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (2,1) directly.\n\nFrom (2,7), I can go down to (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1).\n\nThat's a straight path down to the apple at (2,1).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, there don't seem to be any apples or snakes in that column, so it should be safe.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is on the same Y level as me, at X=8, Y=7.\n\nIf it moves left towards me, I need to be cautious.\n\nBut for now, it's far away, so maybe it's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that moving down towards (2,1) might put me in the path of the enemy snake if it decides to move down as well.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apple at (0,3) might be a safer option, but it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the potential points I can gain by going for certain apples"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (2,6). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (2,7), but in the current board state, it shows me at (2,6). Hmm, maybe I moved down from (2,7) to (2,6) in the last turn. Okay, so I need to make sure I'm looking at the current position, which is (2,6).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apples are at (1,7), (0,3), (8,0), (2,1), and (5,2).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (8,6), with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,6), and I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me think about the apples nearby.\n\nThe apple at (1,7) is up and to the left from my current position. That's one step up to (2,7), then one step left to (1,7).\n\nBut wait, in the last move, I was at (2,7), moved down to (2,6). So, to get to (1,7), I need to move up to (2,7), then left to (1,7).\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy snake at (8,6). It's quite far away, but I need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,1), which is directly below me. I can move down to it.\n\nLet me calculate the distances:\n\n- To (1,7): up 1 to (2,7), then left 1 to (1,7), total 2 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): down 5 steps to (2,1), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (0,3): left 2 to (0,6), then down 3 to (0,3), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (5,2): right 3 to (5,6), then down 4 to (5,2), total 7 steps.\n\n- To (8,0): right 6 to (8,6), then down 6 to (8,0), total 12 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,7) at 2 steps.\n\nBut I need to consider potential conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), then left to (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away. It would take them several moves to reach me, so I should be safe for now.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,7), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I have a path to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nCurrently, I'm at (2,6). If I move up to (2,7), then left to (1,7), my tail will be at (2,6).\n\nThen, if I move down from (1,7) to (1,6), my tail moves to (2,7).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,6), my tail moves to (1,7), and so on.\n\nWait, I need to be careful not to move into my own tail.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you move, your tail stays where it is until the new head is placed. So, after eating the apple, your tail extends.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nStarting at (2,6).\n\nMove up to (2,7), eat apple at (1,7). Now, my snake is:\n\n- Head at (2,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,6)\n\nThen, move left to (1,7). Now:\n\n- Head at (1,7)\n\n- Previous head at (2,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,6)\n\nThen, move down to (1,6):\n\n- Head at (1,6)\n\n- Previous head at (1,7)\n\n- Tail at (2,7)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't move into any of these positions.\n\nSeems manageable for now.\n\nAlternatively, going directly down to (2,1) might be safer, but it's farther.\n\nI need to balance between getting the closest apple and avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (8,6). It could move left towards me or down towards (8,0).\n\nIf it moves left, it would have to cover a lot of ground to reach me, which gives me time to get the apple and position myself.\n\nIf it moves down towards (8,0), that might be a different strategy.\n\nI need to assume the enemy is trying to get to the apple at (8,0), but it's far away.\n\nSo, for now, I think it's safe to go for the apple at (1,7).\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating (1,7), there might be other apples I can reach easily.\n\nFor example, from (1,7), I can go down to (1,6), then (1,5), and so on, maybe towards (1,1), then right to (2,1) for another apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in that path, so it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,7), I could go left to (0,7), then down to (0,3), but that's a longer path.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Path to (2,1): down from (1,7) to (1,1), then right to (2,1)\n\n- Path to (0,3): left from (1,7) to (0,7), then down to (0,3)\n\nThe path to (2,1) is shorter, only 6 steps down and then right, total 7 steps.\n\nPath to (0,3) is 1 step left and 4 down, total 5 steps.\n\nBut from (1,7), the path to (0,3) is shorter, but I might want to prioritize the apple at (2,1) because it's closer to my current position.\n\nWait, no, from (1,7), (0,3) is closer than (2,1).\n\nWait, from (1,7):\n\n- To (0,3): left 1 to (0,7), then down 4 to (0,3), total 5 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): right 1 to (2,7), then down 6 to (2,1), total 7 steps.\n\nSo, (0,3) is closer from (1,7).\n\nBut I need to consider the entire path from my current position.\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\n- To (1,7): up 1 to (2,7), left 1 to (1,7), then to (0,3): left 1 to (0,7), down 4 to (0,3), total 7 steps.\n\n- To (2,1): down 5 to (2,1), total 5 steps.\n\nWait, directly down to (2,1) is only 5 steps, whereas going via (1,7) and then to (0,3) is 7 steps.\n\nSo, maybe going directly down to (2,1) is better in terms of steps.\n\nBut then, there's an apple at (1,7) right next to me. It might be better to grab that first and gain the point and the length.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that growing longer might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut in this case, the board is 10x10, and I'm starting small, so length shouldn't be a big issue yet.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the enemy snake. If I go for (1,7), the enemy is at (8,6), which is far away, so it should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (2,1), the enemy is at (8,6), which is also far away.\n\nBut perhaps going down towards (2,1) might put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off if it moves down towards (8,0).\n\nWait, but (8,0) is at X=8, Y=0, which is down and to the right from the enemy's current position.\n\nIf the enemy moves down towards (8,0), I can move down towards (2,1), and we're moving in opposite directions, so unlikely to collide.\n\nUnless the enemy changes its path.\n\nBut since it's a snake game, and assuming the enemy is trying to maximize its score as well, it might go for the closest apple, which for it would be (8,0).\n\nSo, perhaps it's safe for me to go down towards (2,1).\n\nBut, the apple at (1,7) is right next to me, and I can get it quickly.\n\nLet me think about the time it would take.\n\nIf I go up to (2,7), left to (1,7), eat the apple, then down to (1,6), (1,5), ..., (1,1), then right to (2,1), that's a total of 2 + 5 +1 = 8 steps.\n\nVersus going directly down to ("

According to the board, there is an apple at (1,7), so if I'm at (1,7), I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLet's consider the positions of the remaining apples:\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (8,0)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (8,6).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,7) to each apple:\n\n- (0,3): |1-0| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (8,0): |1-8| + |7-0| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n- (2,1): |1-2| + |7-1| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- (5,2): |1-5| + |7-2| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (5,3): |1-5| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,3), with a distance of 5.\n\nNext closest is (2,1) at distance 7, then (5,3) at 8, and (5,2) at 9, and (8,0) at 14.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (0,3) next.\n\nLet's think about the path to (0,3):\n\nFrom (1,7):\n\n- Left to (0,7)\n\n- Down to (0,6)\n\n- Down to (0,5)\n\n- Down to (0,4)\n\n- Down to (0,3)\n\nThat's a total of 1 + 4 = 5 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nI need to make sure that this path is safe and doesn't lead me into the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,6), which is at the other end of the board.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move towards me, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to consider the possibility of the enemy snake moving towards me.\n\nHowever, since it's far away, and I'm going left and down, while the enemy is at (8,6), it would take several moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nMoreover, snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I don't move into the enemy snake's position, I should be fine.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (0,3), I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's plan the path to (0,3):\n\nMove sequence:\n\n1. Left to (0,7)\n\n2. Down to (0,6)\n\n3. Down to (0,5)\n\n4. Down to (0,4)\n\n5. Down to (0,3)\n\nAfter eating (0,3), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (8,0)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\nNow, from (0,3), the closest apple is (2,1), with a distance of:\n\n|0-2| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nNext is (5,3): |0-5| + |3-3| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\nThen (5,2): |0-5| + |3-2| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nAnd (8,0): |0-8| + |3-0| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nSo, (2,1) is the closest next apple.\n\nFrom (0,3):\n\n- Right to (1,3)\n\n- Right to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\nThat's 2 + 2 = 4 moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), next closest apple would be (5,3):\n\n|2-5| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nThen (5,2): |2-5| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nWait, (5,2) is closer than (5,3).\n\nFrom (2,1):\n\n- Up to (2,2)\n\n- Up to (2,3)\n\n- Right to (3,3)\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\nThat's 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, to (5,2):\n\n- Up to (2,2)\n\n- Right to (3,2)\n\n- Right to (4,2)\n\n- Right to (5,2)\n\nThat's 1 + 3 = 4 moves.\n\nSo, it's better to go for (5,2) after (2,1).\n\nAfter eating (5,2), next is (5,3), which is just up one step to (5,3).\n\nThen, (8,0) is next, which is |5-8| + |2-0| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, the path would be:\n\n- From (5,2) to (5,3)\n\n- Then to (8,3), but wait, (8,0) is at (8,0).\n\nSo, from (5,3):\n\n- Right to (6,3)\n\n- Right to (7,3)\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\n- Down to (8,0)\n\nThat's 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4), but no, (8,0) is down.\n\nWait, perhaps a better path:\n\nFrom (5,2):\n\n- Right to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\n- Down to (8,0)\n\nThat's 3 + 2 = 5 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSo, overall plan:\n\n1. From (1,7), move LEFT to (0,7)\n\n2. Move DOWN to (0,6)\n\n3. Move DOWN to (0,5)\n\n4. Move DOWN to (0,4)\n\n5. Move DOWN to (0,3) and eat the apple.\n\n6. Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n7."
