My best strategy, instead, is to focus on advancing to acquire new apples rather than just returning to previously collected ones.\n\n### Tactical Consideration for Future Strategy\nI need to plan my movement toward apples that are still on the board. The apples at (0, 6), (9, 3), (0, 1), and (9, 8) can serve as future targets. Perhaps positioning toward an apple while avoiding conflict with both enemy snakes is crucial.\n\n### Decision\nGiven that all moves from my current position lead to empty spaces or backtracking, I will choose to explore alternate avenues nearby to maintain my advantage.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT** (to (6, 5))\n\nBy moving left, I can then navigate back towards better strategic points towards future apples while avoiding the enemy and empty spaces."

Since Snake #2 is on the verge of advancing towards me on the next turn from (9, 7), I should keep my distance while still navigating towards apples. The apples available at (0, 6), (9, 3), (0, 1), and (9, 8) are significant, and my options to access them should be streamlined.\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (4, 6) keeps my options open as I can maneuver towards either (5, 7) which is upward or back toward (5, 5) should I need to reposition. Importantly, leftward movement towards (4, 6) continues my path towards potential apples while also maintaining an escape route from the enemy snake.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\n**LEFT** to (4, 6)."
