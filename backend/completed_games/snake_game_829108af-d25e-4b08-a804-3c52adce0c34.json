However, I should also consider the risk of colliding with Snake #1. In this case, I decide to prioritize safety and move towards the apple at (7, 0) to minimize the risk of collision with Snake #1.\n\nNext move: LEFT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I can safely move towards the apple at (1, 0), I will do so. If not, I will continue to move towards the apple that is furthest from Snake #1 while still being within reach."
