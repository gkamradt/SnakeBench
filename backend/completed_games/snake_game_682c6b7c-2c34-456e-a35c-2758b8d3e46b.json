This will give us a better chance of reaching an apple before the enemy snake.\n\nHowever, I also notice that the enemy snake is at position (3, 1) with its body at [(4, 1), (4, 2)]. This means that if we move left and then down, we might be able to reach the apple at (3, 0) or (0, 8) without encountering the enemy snake.\n\nBut since we are at the top of the board, moving left is the only viable option for now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue to monitor the enemy snake's movement and be prepared to adjust our plan if necessary. Also, consider the possibility of moving down to reach the apple at (3, 0) or (0, 8) if we can't reach the apple at (1, 8) or if the enemy snake starts moving towards it.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
