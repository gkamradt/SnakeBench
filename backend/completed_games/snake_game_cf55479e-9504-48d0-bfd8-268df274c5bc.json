(4, 2) - 2 steps right, 3 steps down\n3. (7, 5) - 5 steps right, same y-level\n4. (6, 6) - 4 steps right, 1 step up\n5. (7, 0) - 5 steps right, 5 steps down\n\nStrategy analysis:\n- Still aiming for (3, 6) as it's the closest apple\n- I can't go DOWN as that's where my tail is (would die)\n- Enemy snake at (9, 9) is far away\n- Moving RIGHT would directly progress me toward the apple at (3, 6)\n- Moving UP would position me at (2, 6), still allowing me to get to (3, 6) but taking longer\n\nThe most efficient move is to go RIGHT as:\n1. It directly reduces distance to nearest apple (3, 6)\n2. It's a safe move with no obstacles\n3. It keeps options open for other nearby apples (6, 6) and (7, 5)\n\nFor next turn: After moving RIGHT, I'll be at (3, 5), then I can move UP to reach the apple at (3, 6).\n\nRIGHT"
