However, moving directly to (8, 4) would require moving up, which is not the immediate next step.\n- **Path to Apple**: Since the snake is already at (1, 4), it has already reached the apple. The next step should be to move in a direction that keeps the snake alive and positions it for the next apple.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- **Enemy Snake**: The enemy snake is at (1, 1), which is far from the current position and does not pose an immediate threat.\n- **Walls**: Moving in any direction from (1, 4) does not risk hitting a wall immediately.\n- **Self-Collision**: The snake has no body segments, so self-collision is not a concern.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that the snake has already reached the apple at (1, 4), the next move should be to move in a direction that keeps the snake alive and positions it for the next apple. The next nearest apple is at (8, 4), which is directly above the snake's current position. Therefore, moving up is the best next step.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- After moving up to (1, 5), the next nearest apple is still at (8, 4). Continue moving up until the snake reaches (8, 4) to gain another point.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and avoid any potential threats as the game progresses.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"
