It's crucial to monitor its movement potentially towards central apples.\n\n**Next Best Actions and Pathing**:\n- If the head of my snake moves LEFT from (1, 1), it will be at position (0, 1). No immediate direct move toward the apple at (0, 0) due to the previous confusion in directions. \n- The correct adjustment, matching the board position and goal, is to move DOWN to location (1, 0) and then another subsequent move of LEFT obtain the apple (0, 0).\n\n**Strategy for Following Moves**:\n- After collecting the apple at (0, 0), a tactical pivot will be needed towards the center and upper side of the board to collect other apples while carefully avoiding potential paths where the enemy snake may intersect.\n- Consider evaluating a secure path towards (1, 5), while being conscious of vertical moves that can position the snake advantageously around the center where most apples are clustered.\n\n**Immediate Move Strategy**: \n- **Move**: DOWN\n- **Reasoning**: Adjust the position closer to the apple at (0, 0) for a follow-up move. This move ensures safety and prepares for the subsequent collection of the apple.\n\n**Strategy Statement for Next Turn**:\nPost claiming the apple at (0, 0) in the subsequent move, plan an upward routing to target the apple at (1, 5), focusing on maximizing apple collections and maintaining maneuverability options.\n\n**Decided Move**: DOWN\nThis move corrects the board state understanding, effectively transitioning towards the target apple safely while preparing for follow-up strategic movements."

A straight path can be good, but capturing the closest apple should be the priority.\n\n**Path Decisions**:\n- From your current head position (2, 0), moving directly left (by decreasing x-coordinate) will immediately put you on (0, 0), where there is an apple. This move is straightforward and safe, requiring only two steps to the left (LEFT, LEFT).\n\n**Next Turn Strategy**:\n- After collecting the apple at (0, 0), assess the next closest apple (likely (1, 5)) and plan the route while keeping safe from potential blocks or encirclements by Snake #2.\n\n**Decided Move**:\nConsidering the proximity and no obstacles, the optimal move right now would be to move to the LEFT towards the apple at (0, 0).

It's crucial to monitor its movement potentially towards central apples.\n\n**Next Best Actions and Pathing**:\n- If the head of my snake moves LEFT from (1, 1), it will be at position (0, 1). No immediate direct move toward the apple at (0, 0) due to the previous confusion in directions. \n- The correct adjustment, matching the board position and goal, is to move DOWN to location (1, 0) and then another subsequent move of LEFT obtain the apple (0, 0).\n\n**Strategy for Following Moves**:\n- After collecting the apple at (0, 0), a tactical pivot will be needed towards the center and upper side of the board to collect other apples while carefully avoiding potential paths where the enemy snake may intersect.\n- Consider evaluating a secure path towards (1, 5), while being conscious of vertical moves that can position the snake advantageously around the center where most apples are clustered.\n\n**Immediate Move Strategy**: \n- **Move**: DOWN\n- **Reasoning**: Adjust the position closer to the apple at (0, 0) for a follow-up move.

This move does not encounter any walls or other snake bodies, confirming its safety.\n- After securing the apple at (0, 0), planning the next move would involve turning UP towards the center of the board, which could position the snake closer to other apples while also avoiding any encounters with Snake #2.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy**:\nPost collecting the apple at (0, 0), turn UP to reposition towards the next closest apple at (1, 5). This would involve moving towards the higher y-coordinate rows, which are currently clear of any enemies.\n\n**Final Move Decision**:\n- **Move**: LEFT\n- **Reasoning**: Immediately claim the apple at (0, 0) while taking advantage of no nearby threats. This move is safe and contributes directly to the score.\n\n**Next Steps**:\nAfter this movement, prepare to turn UP towards the central axis of the board for subsequent strategic movements and apple collections.

It's crucial to monitor its movement potentially towards central apples.\n\n**Next Best Actions and Pathing**:\n- If the head of my snake moves LEFT from (1, 1), it will be at position (0, 1). No immediate direct move toward the apple at (0, 0) due to the previous confusion in directions. \n- The correct adjustment, matching the board position and goal, is to move DOWN to location (1, 0) and then another subsequent move of LEFT obtain the apple (0, 0).\n\n**Strategy for Following Moves**:\n- After collecting the apple at (0, 0), a tactical pivot will be needed towards the center and upper side of the board to collect other apples while carefully avoiding potential paths where the enemy snake may intersect.\n- Consider evaluating a secure path towards (1, 5), while being conscious of vertical moves that can position the snake advantageously around the center where most apples are clustered.\n\n**Immediate Move Strategy**: \n- **Move**: DOWN\n- **Reasoning**: Adjust the position closer to the apple at (0, 0) for a follow-up move.
