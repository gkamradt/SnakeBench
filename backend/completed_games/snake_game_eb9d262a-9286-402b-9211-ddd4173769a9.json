While both moving DOWN (to (6,6)) or LEFT (to (5,7)) get me roughly equally closer to, say, the apple at (1,5) (both options reduce the Manhattan distance from 7 to 6), moving LEFT builds horizontal progress toward the cluster where most apples lie (at x = 0\u20132). There are no hazards immediately in (5,7) and no enemy snake issues; enemy snake #2 is at (7,5) and isn\u2019t interfering right now. \n\nStrategy reminder for later turns: I plan to edge my way left into the apple cluster and then, when safe, adjust vertically to snatch up the apples while avoiding collisions with walls or enemy snakes.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
