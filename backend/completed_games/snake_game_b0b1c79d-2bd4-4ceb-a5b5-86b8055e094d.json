Additionally, the vertical path is relatively free from obstructions except the enemy snake, potentially lesser risky than traversing horizontally across numerous potential paths.\n\nGiven these considerations and aiming to avoid immediate contact with the enemy, the logical move for this turn is to reduce risks and move in a direction that gradually brings me closer to the apple at (5, 8) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.

This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

However, moving directly up to it is risky due to the proximity of the enemy snake at (8, 6) who could potentially move down or sideways.\n- The last move made was to the right (EAST). This suggests a strategy to eventually move upwards to reach the apple at (5, 8) without immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n**Board Layout Concerns:**\n- If the snake has just moved right to position (10, 3), intuitively, this would be out of bounds, as the highest x-coordinate on the board is 9. This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

This suggests a strategy to eventually move upwards to reach the apple at (5, 8) without immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n**Board Layout Concerns:**\n- If the snake has just moved right to position (10, 3), intuitively, this would be out of bounds, as the highest x-coordinate on the board is 9. This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

However, moving directly up to it is risky due to the proximity of the enemy snake at (8, 6) who could potentially move down or sideways.\n- The last move made was to the right (EAST). This suggests a strategy to eventually move upwards to reach the apple at (5, 8) without immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n**Board Layout Concerns:**\n- If the snake has just moved right to position (10, 3), intuitively, this would be out of bounds, as the highest x-coordinate on the board is 9. This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

This maneuver keeps me in a more flexible mid-board position and opens up subsequent moves toward the left or right as needed for both escaping threats and pursuing apples.\n\n**Future Strategy Considerations:**\nMonitor the movement of Snake #2 after moving down. Depending on their trajectory, I might need a strategy to quickly shift either left or right, aiming for a safe and efficient path to the nearest apples. Continue adapting to the evolving board state to maintain a survival advantage and score opportunities.\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN**"

Other apples are somewhat equidistant or less strategically positioned when considering the potential path and possible confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (8, 6) with no apparent body segment. This proximity to my snake means moving upwards directly could invite risk if the enemy snake decides to move downward. However, the absence of a body segment on the enemy snake means only the head poses a threat, which allows some predictability in its movement toward or away from an apple.\n\nThe strategy to target the apple at (5, 8) requires me to move upwards cautiously without placing myself immediately next to the enemy snake. Additionally, the vertical path is relatively free from obstructions except the enemy snake, potentially lesser risky than traversing horizontally across numerous potential paths.\n\nGiven these considerations and aiming to avoid immediate contact with the enemy, the logical move for this turn is to reduce risks and move in a direction that gradually brings me closer to the apple at (5, 8) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.

However, moving directly up to it is risky due to the proximity of the enemy snake at (8, 6) who could potentially move down or sideways.\n- The last move made was to the right (EAST). This suggests a strategy to eventually move upwards to reach the apple at (5, 8) without immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n**Board Layout Concerns:**\n- If the snake has just moved right to position (10, 3), intuitively, this would be out of bounds, as the highest x-coordinate on the board is 9. This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

Other apples are somewhat equidistant or less strategically positioned when considering the potential path and possible confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (8, 6) with no apparent body segment.

This suggests a strategy to eventually move upwards to reach the apple at (5, 8) without immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n**Board Layout Concerns:**\n- If the snake has just moved right to position (10, 3), intuitively, this would be out of bounds, as the highest x-coordinate on the board is 9. This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

The apple at (5, 8) is located 5 cells directly above my current position at (8, 3). Other apples are somewhat equidistant or less strategically positioned when considering the potential path and possible confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (8, 6) with no apparent body segment. This proximity to my snake means moving upwards directly could invite risk if the enemy snake decides to move downward. However, the absence of a body segment on the enemy snake means only the head poses a threat, which allows some predictability in its movement toward or away from an apple.\n\nThe strategy to target the apple at (5, 8) requires me to move upwards cautiously without placing myself immediately next to the enemy snake. Additionally, the vertical path is relatively free from obstructions except the enemy snake, potentially lesser risky than traversing horizontally across numerous potential paths.\n\nGiven these considerations and aiming to avoid immediate contact with the enemy, the logical move for this turn is to reduce risks and move in a direction that gradually brings me closer to the apple at (5, 8) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. Since moving up directly could risk confrontation if the enemy chooses to move down, a strategic approach would be to initially move right (East) to potentially align myself better for a future upward move.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

This suggests a strategy to eventually move upwards to reach the apple at (5, 8) without immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n**Board Layout Concerns:**\n- If the snake has just moved right to position (10, 3), intuitively, this would be out of bounds, as the highest x-coordinate on the board is 9. This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

Other apples are somewhat equidistant or less strategically positioned when considering the potential path and possible confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (8, 6) with no apparent body segment.

This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

Other apples are somewhat equidistant or less strategically positioned when considering the potential path and possible confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (8, 6) with no apparent body segment. This proximity to my snake means moving upwards directly could invite risk if the enemy snake decides to move downward. However, the absence of a body segment on the enemy snake means only the head poses a threat, which allows some predictability in its movement toward or away from an apple.\n\nThe strategy to target the apple at (5, 8) requires me to move upwards cautiously without placing myself immediately next to the enemy snake. Additionally, the vertical path is relatively free from obstructions except the enemy snake, potentially lesser risky than traversing horizontally across numerous potential paths.\n\nGiven these considerations and aiming to avoid immediate contact with the enemy, the logical move for this turn is to reduce risks and move in a direction that gradually brings me closer to the apple at (5, 8) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.

However, moving directly up to it is risky due to the proximity of the enemy snake at (8, 6) who could potentially move down or sideways.\n- The last move made was to the right (EAST). This suggests a strategy to eventually move upwards to reach the apple at (5, 8) without immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n**Board Layout Concerns:**\n- If the snake has just moved right to position (10, 3), intuitively, this would be out of bounds, as the highest x-coordinate on the board is 9. This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

Assessing my and the enemy's move continuously will allow flexibility in my strategy.\n\n**Current Decision for This Move:**  \nConsidering all factors, moving **UP** is most beneficial to approach the apple at (4, 9) while maintaining relative safety from enemy maneuvers and avoiding trapping myself against board edges or the enemy's location.\n\n**Future Strategy:**  \nAfter moving up, reevaluate positioning relative to Apple at (4, 9) and enemy movements. Depending on the enemy's strategy, consider shifting direction to best access other apples, perhaps moving left to centralize between high-potential apple areas.\n\n**Decided next move: UP**"

The apple at (5, 8) is located 5 cells directly above my current position at (8, 3). Other apples are somewhat equidistant or less strategically positioned when considering the potential path and possible confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (8, 6) with no apparent body segment. This proximity to my snake means moving upwards directly could invite risk if the enemy snake decides to move downward. However, the absence of a body segment on the enemy snake means only the head poses a threat, which allows some predictability in its movement toward or away from an apple.\n\nThe strategy to target the apple at (5, 8) requires me to move upwards cautiously without placing myself immediately next to the enemy snake. Additionally, the vertical path is relatively free from obstructions except the enemy snake, potentially lesser risky than traversing horizontally across numerous potential paths.\n\nGiven these considerations and aiming to avoid immediate contact with the enemy, the logical move for this turn is to reduce risks and move in a direction that gradually brings me closer to the apple at (5, 8) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. Since moving up directly could risk confrontation if the enemy chooses to move down, a strategic approach would be to initially move right (East) to potentially align myself better for a future upward move.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

However, moving directly up to it is risky due to the proximity of the enemy snake at (8, 6) who could potentially move down or sideways.\n- The last move made was to the right (EAST). This suggests a strategy to eventually move upwards to reach the apple at (5, 8) without immediate conflict with the enemy snake.\n\n**Board Layout Concerns:**\n- If the snake has just moved right to position (10, 3), intuitively, this would be out of bounds, as the highest x-coordinate on the board is 9. This poses an error in initial analysis, and correction is necessary. Assuming a slight mistake in describing the previous position or the move, let's reconsider:\n    - Assuming snake position remains at (9, 3) if somehow the 'moving right' isn't counted due to boundary:\n    - Moving UP from the current position is a risk due to the proximity to the enemy snake's head.\n    - Continuing RIGHT is impossible because of the wall/boundary.\n    - Going DOWN from the current position (9, 3) is possible but moves away from the nearest apple (5, 8).\n    - LEFT is the only reasonable move that avoids immediate risks and might realign the snake towards accessible apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- By moving LEFT, the snake heads towards the center grid of the board, possibly allowing for tactical flexibility in subsequent moves to either move UP towards several apples on the upper half of the board or adjust based on the enemy snake's position.\n- Additionally, moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially navigate to either (5, 8) or perhaps re-target to an apple at (4, 9) by gradually working upwards through less risky paths.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (8, 3), reassess the enemy's position and apple availability afterward.\n- Goal for subsequent turns will be vertically aligning safely while minimizing risk from enemy movements.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

Its current head\u2019s proximity to the apple at (4, 9) is a potential threat, but seems to be too distanced to immediately intercept unless it shifts its strategy drastically southwards.\n\n**Strategic Options Evaluation:**\n1. **UP:** Moving up to (8, 8) moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) vertically. However, as (9, 9) directly above this point is the board boundary, this move might lead directly to a dead end unless followed by a lateral movement.\n2. **LEFT:** This movement can be strategically beneficial, setting a direct course terminating at the apple at (4, 9). It also avoids immediate collision threats while positioning for a nutritious goal.\n3. **RIGHT:** This would edge towards the board boundary (right edge at x=9), offering no strategic advantage and potentially trapping the snake.\n4. **DOWN:** This option is less optimal as it takes me further from the nearest apple and potentially into more open, risky territory towards the lower board areas.\n\n**Move Decision Rationale:**\nI will choose **LEFT**, moving towards (7, 7). This decision strategically progresses towards the closest apple at (4, 9) while remaining adaptable for future maneuvers. It also avoids any imminent threat from walls or the enemy snake\u2019s current trajectory.\n\n**Future Strategy Considerations:**\nAfter moving towards the left in pursuit of the apple at (4, 9), I will need to carefully evaluate the position of the enemy and any potential threats from continuing in this direction, or need to turn either up or back towards the right to avoid the board edge and maintain options for movement.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"
