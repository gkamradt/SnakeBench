This will put the snake in a position where it can safely collect the apple without the risk of immediate collision with the enemy snake.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (2, 5), the snake should reassess the situation to plan the next move. The snake should be aware of the enemy snake's possible movements and avoid getting too close to it or its body. The snake should also consider the apples at (5, 8) and (9, 5) as potential targets, but these should be approached with caution, ensuring there is a clear and safe path to them.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next move for the snake should be:\n\nRIGHT to position (2, 3), preparing to move up to the apple at (2, 5) on the subsequent turn while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving right, assess the enemy snake's position. If it's safe to do so, move up to collect the apple at (2, 5). If the enemy snake has moved in a way that blocks the direct path to the apple, consider an alternative route that ensures safety and maximizes the chances of collecting more apples without risking a collision."
