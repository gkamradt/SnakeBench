A . . . . A . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 A . . . .

Since I'm currently at (2, 7), moving DOWN will place me at (2, 6) (the apple's position), and from there, I can move again DOWN to directly reach the apple at (2, 5).\n\nGiven that I want to maintain my route toward the apple and avoid becoming entangled with the enemy snake, the best move is to proceed DOWN. \n\nI do want to keep in mind future directions as a secondary step will involve moving still further to collect more apples while being wary of the enemy's movements.\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN.**"
