Notice from the board that our \u201cbody\u201d spans more than just the head. We see \u201cT\u201d in column 9 on row 5 and row 6.

Of these, the apple at (9,1) is in the same column as our head, just three steps directly downward.\n\n\u2022 Examining our possible moves from (9,4):\n\u2003\u2013 UP would land at (9,5), but that cell holds our body (a \u201cT\u201d) and would cause a self-collision.\n\u2003\u2013 RIGHT goes off the board (x would become 10, and the board goes only to x=9).\n\u2003\u2013 LEFT would lead us to (8,4), which is safe but puts us further from the nearest apple.\n\u2003\u2013 DOWN leads to (9,3) which is a safe, empty cell that moves us closer to the apple at (9,1).\n\n\u2022 Meanwhile, enemy snake #2 is positioned at (6,3) and is not in immediate danger for collision.\n\nGiven that heading down will bring us closer to the most accessible apple while avoiding collisions, our next move is to go DOWN.\n\nStrategy for upcoming turns:\n\u2022 After reaching (9,1) and consuming the apple, re-assess which remaining apple (perhaps at (7,1) or one of the ones on the bottom row) is closest.\n\u2022 Always take care to avoid moving into our growing body or off the board, and remain cautious about the enemy snake\u2019s position.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."
