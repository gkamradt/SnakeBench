So, the safest option would be to move up (down in the game's terms) to position (0, 8). This move allows me to avoid collisions and potentially reach an apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards an apple while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\nNext move: DOWN (which is UP in the game's terms)"
