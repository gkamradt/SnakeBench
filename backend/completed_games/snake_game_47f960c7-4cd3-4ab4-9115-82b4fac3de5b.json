It avoids any collisions with our body or with walls, and since the enemy snake is far away, there\u2019s no immediate risk from it.\n\nFor strategy, on subsequent moves we should continue moving downward to reach (1,1), collect the apple, and then reassess the board for the next target apple.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."

Our head is at (1,1), and our body occupies cells in row 2 (namely (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), and (3,2)). The enemy snake\u2019s head is at (3,5) (with its tail stretching upward from that point), so it isn\u2019t an immediate threat.\n\nLooking at the closest apple, (4,0), we see that from our head at (1,1) we need to move to a position that reduces both the horizontal gap (from 1 to 4) and the vertical gap (from 1 to 0). Our adjacent possibilities are:\n\u2003\u2022 UP to (1,2): Not an option because that square is occupied by our own body.\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT to (0,1): Safe, but it would take us further from our apple.\n\u2003\u2022 RIGHT to (2,1): Safe and moves us horizontally closer.\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN to (1,0): Also safe and gets our y coordinate to 0 (which is the apple\u2019s y\u2010value).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN would reduce the Manhattan distance equally (distance becomes 3). However, planning ahead for our corridor to (4,0), we eventually want to move east to cover the remaining horizontal gap. Moving RIGHT puts us in a favorable position to head east on subsequent turns. There are no immediate hazards in that direction, and it doesn't risk trapping us given our current body layout. \n\nThus, I plan to move RIGHT next. Next turn I\u2019ll look to either continue heading east or drop down if needed while keeping clear of our own trailing segments and monitoring the enemy snake's location.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

Our head is at (1,1), and our body occupies cells in row 2 (namely (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), and (3,2)). The enemy snake\u2019s head is at (3,5) (with its tail stretching upward from that point), so it isn\u2019t an immediate threat.\n\nLooking at the closest apple, (4,0), we see that from our head at (1,1) we need to move to a position that reduces both the horizontal gap (from 1 to 4) and the vertical gap (from 1 to 0). Our adjacent possibilities are:\n\u2003\u2022 UP to (1,2): Not an option because that square is occupied by our own body.\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT to (0,1): Safe, but it would take us further from our apple.\n\u2003\u2022 RIGHT to (2,1): Safe and moves us horizontally closer.\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN to (1,0): Also safe and gets our y coordinate to 0 (which is the apple\u2019s y\u2010value).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN would reduce the Manhattan distance equally (distance becomes 3). However, planning ahead for our corridor to (4,0), we eventually want to move east to cover the remaining horizontal gap. Moving RIGHT puts us in a favorable position to head east on subsequent turns. There are no immediate hazards in that direction, and it doesn't risk trapping us given our current body layout. \n\nThus, I plan to move RIGHT next. Next turn I\u2019ll look to either continue heading east or drop down if needed while keeping clear of our own trailing segments and monitoring the enemy snake's location.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

The apple at (0, 7) is far left and a bit up.\n\nIf I go UP to (8, 6): I can then go towards the apples at (8, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), (5, 8), but it is not a direct path, and it sets me up to potentially run into my own body later on.\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 5): This potentially opens a path to the (7,8) apple and other apples to the left/above me.\n\nSnake 2 is at (6, 2), far away from me.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,5) seems like a good move to potentially reach the (7,8) apple.\nNext turn strategy: Since I will be at (7,5) next turn, I should move towards UP. If that path becomes blocked, I will re-evaluate and attempt to get closer to the other apples.\n\nFinal Answer: LEFT\nLEFT"
