This apple will no longer be on the board. \n\nOur current position is at (2, 9), with nearby options:\n- (7, 2)\n- (8, 1)\n- (8, 5)\n- (8, 8)\n- (9, 1)\n\nEvaluating the path to these apples, we need to consider their distance and position relative to the enemy snake. Notably, the apples clustered near (8, 1) and (9, 1) are in close proximity to the enemy snake at (5,1). This situation warrants careful navigation around possible encounters.\n\nThe apple at (7, 2), while still near the region of the enemy, is closer and likely easier to approach through careful horizontal movement followed by vertical descent. \n\nStrategy for next turn:\nStrategize on navigating toward (7, 2). We would likely take a horizontal path, as direct moves towards the south pose a risk of getting too close to the enemy snake. Plan a move along y = 9 towards the East right now. Upon getting in line with x = 7, we can then decide the best approach, either directly descending south if the enemy snake moves away or recalculating our route based on the enemy's new position.\n\nDecided next move:\n- RIGHT. Moving in this direction gets us closer to the apple at (7, 2), minimizing risk and setting us up to potentially secure additional apples near the east side of the board in a subsequent move."
