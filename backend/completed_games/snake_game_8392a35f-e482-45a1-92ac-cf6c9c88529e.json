This doesn't seem strategically advantageous.\n\nGoing UP seems like the best option to get closer to multiple apples.\n\nNext turn, I will re-evaluate the board state and decide whether to continue towards the apples at (2, 9) and (3, 7), or to move towards the apples at (0, 4) and (0, 5).\n\nMy next move is UP.\nUP"
