I want to prioritize safety to avoid running into the enemy snake as well as stay on the board. Here's my thinking process:\n\n1. **Immediate Safety**: \n   - The enemy snake is quite close to my current position at (7, 1), so I need to avoid moving right to prevent a collision risk. \n   - Thus, moving UP or LEFT seems safer for the current scenario.\n\n2. **Apple Proximity**:\n   - The nearest apple is at (6, 5), which is directly above me. It's in a vertical line, just five units away in the positive y direction.\n   - Other apples are farther away and require more navigation. For instance, the apple at (5, 3) can be reached by going LEFT and then UP, but that's more steps compared to just going UP for the apple at (6, 5).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - My main strategy will focus on safely approaching the apple at (6, 5) while maintaining awareness of the enemy snake\u2019s position.\n   - Repositioning myself towards the center is also beneficial as it allows greater flexibility to reach other apples in subsequent turns.\n\nConsidering these points, I am going to move UP aiming for the closest apple while maintaining a safe position relative to the enemy snake.\n\n**Next Move Decision: UP**"

However, moving directly towards it would put us in the path of the enemy snake #1. Therefore, we should first move towards the apple at (6, 5), which is to the left and up from our current position. This will also put us in a better position to reach the apple at (5, 3) afterwards.\n\nSo, let's move LEFT first, then we can consider moving UP in the next turn.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
