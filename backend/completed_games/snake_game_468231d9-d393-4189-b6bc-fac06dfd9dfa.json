            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,8). There are apples at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9). Also, there's an enemy snake at (5,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 3,9), then some dots, then 1 (enemy snake at 5,9), more dots, and A at 8,9, and 2 (me at 9,8).\n\nRow 8: Dots, except for me at 9,8.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: All dots.\n\nRow 4: All dots.\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: A at 4,2.\n\nRow 1: A at 1,1 and 4,1.\n\nRow 0: A at 0,9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board state you provided, it seems like the apples and snakes are placed differently. Let me make sure I'm looking at the correct positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 9: A at 0,9; dots; 1 at 5,9; dots; A at 8,9; 2 at 9,8.\n\nRow 8: Dots, except for 2 at 9,8.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: All dots.\n\nRow 4: All dots.\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: A at 4,2.\n\nRow 1: A at 1,1; A at 4,1; dots.\n\nRow 0: A at 0,9.\n\nWait, but in row 9, it shows A at 0,9 and 8,9, and 1 at 5,9, and 2 at 9,8. But according to the apple positions, apples are at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9). So, apple at 8,9 is correct, and at 0,9, and at 1,1, and at 4,2, and at 3,1.\n\nBut in row 9, it shows A at 0,9 and 8,9, and 1 at 5,9, and 2 at 9,8.\n\nIn row 1, it shows A at 1,1 and 4,1, but according to the apple positions, there's an apple at (3,1), not (4,1). Maybe a typo in the board state.\n\nAnyway, I need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nI'm at (9,8), and I can move up, down, left, or right, but I need to make sure not to hit walls or the enemy snake or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-turn game, I need to think about a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple.\n\nThe apples are at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9).\n\nI'm at (9,8). The closest apple seems to be at (8,9), which is just one step up from my current position.\n\nWait, no. If I'm at (9,8), and I look at the board, row 9 is y=9, and I'm at x=9, y=8.\n\nWait, actually, in the board state, row 9 is y=9, and columns are x from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position is (9,8), which is in row 8, column 9.\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's described with row 9 being y=9, and positions like (0,9) being row 9, column 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinate system.\n\nLet me clarify: in the board state, rows are listed from 9 to 0, with row 9 being the top row, and columns from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nTherefore, (9,8) is column 9, row 8, which is in the bottom part of the board.\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, y increases upwards.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I'm at (9,8), which is column 9, row 8, near the top-right part of the board.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,1): column 3, row 1, bottom-middle.\n\n- (8,9): column 8, row 9, top-middle.\n\n- (4,2): column 4, row 2, middle-left.\n\n- (1,1): column 1, row 1, bottom-left.\n\n- (0,9): column 0, row 9, top-left.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,9), top-middle, with no body parts, so just the head.\n\nOkay, so I need to navigate from (9,8) to these apples without hitting walls, the enemy, or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nAt (9,8), I can move:\n\n- Up to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Left to (8,8)\n\n- Right would be (10,8), but that's off the board, so can't move right.\n\nWait, board is 10x10, x from 0 to 9, so right at (9,8) would be out of bounds.\n\nSo, possible moves: up, down, left.\n\nLooking at the board, at (9,9), there's nothing mentioned, but looking at the board state, row 9 has positions 0 to 9, and at (8,9) there's an A (apple), and (5,9) has the enemy snake's head.\n\nWait, in row 9, positions are:\n\n0: A\n\n1: .\n\n2: .\n\n3: .\n\n4: .\n\n5: 1 (enemy snake)\n\n6: .\n\n7: .\n\n8: A (apple)\n\n9: . (I think, since 2 is at 9,8, which is row 8, column 9)\n\nWait, actually, in row 9, it's y=9, so positions (0,9) to (9,9).\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 9: A . . . . 1 . . . A .\n\nSo, (0,9): A\n\n(1,9): .\n\n(2,9): .\n\n(3,9): .\n\n(4,9): .\n\n(5,9): 1 (enemy snake)\n\n(6,9): .\n\n(7,9): .\n\n(8,9): A\n\n(9,9): .\n\nTherefore, at (9,9), which is up from me, it's empty.\n\nSo, I can move up to (9,9).\n\nFrom there, I can see an apple at (8,9), which is left from (9,9).\n\nBut I need to be careful not to collide with the enemy snake at (5,9).\n\nAlso, I need to plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could move down to (9,7), but that might not be the best path to the apples.\n\nLet me think about a strategy.\n\nOption 1: Go up to (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, I can continue left towards (5,9), but need to be careful of the enemy snake.\n\nOption 2: Move down to (9,7), then left towards the apples below.\n\nBut the apples below are at (4,2) and (3,1), which might take more moves.\n\nOption 3: Move diagonally up-left towards the apple at (8,9), but since I can't move diagonally in snake games, I need to move up then left, or left then up.\n\nWait, in this game, can the snake move diagonally? From the rules, it seems like it can only move in cardinal directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nAssuming that, I need to plan a path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple.\n\nI'm at (9,8).\n\nApple at (8,9): distance is 1 up and 1 left, total of 2 moves.\n\nApple at (0,9): distance is 9 left and 1 up, total of 10 moves.\n\nApple at (4,2): distance is 5 left and 6 down, total of 11 moves.\n\nApple at (3,1): distance is 6 left and 7 down, total of 13 moves.\n\nApple at (1,1): distance is 8"

There's also an enemy snake at (6,9), but it doesn't have any body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout. Let's visualize the board:\n\n- The y-coordinate increases as we go up, so (0,0) is bottom-left, and (9,9) is top-right.\n\n- I'm at (9,7), which is near the right edge, around the middle to lower part.\n\n- Apples are scattered: one up and left at (8,9), one straight up at (0,9), and others lower down at (3,1), (4,2), and (1,1).\n\n- The enemy snake is at (6,9), which is up and a bit left from my position.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **UP**: From (9,7) to (9,8).\n\n   - What's at (9,8)? Looking back at the board state, it seems to be empty.\n\n   - From there, I can continue up to (9,9), where there might be an apple or not. But looking at the board state, there's an apple at (8,9), which is left from (9,9).\n\n   - I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake at (6,9).\n\n2. **DOWN**: From (9,7) to (9,6).\n\n   - This would take me further down the board, towards the apples at lower y-coordinates like (3,1), (4,2), but it's a longer path.\n\n   - It might not be efficient if there are apples closer upwards.\n\n3. **LEFT**: From (9,7) to (8,7).\n\n   - This direction could potentially lead me towards the apple at (8,9), but it would require moving up after moving left.\n\n   - I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Not possible since x=9 is the rightmost column.\n\nSo, immediate options are UP or DOWN or LEFT.\n\nLet me think strategically:\n\n- **Short-term goal**: Eat the closest apple to maximize points quickly.\n\n- **Long-term goal**: Position myself to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nLooking at the distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,9): From (9,7), I need to move up 2 steps to (9,9), then left to (8,9). That's 3 moves.\n\n- Apple at (0,9): That's all the way left to (0,9), which is a long journey, 9 steps left from (9,7), then up to (0,9). That's 16 moves, assuming a straight line, but walls and enemy might interfere.\n\n- Lower apples like (3,1), (4,2), (1,1): These are further down, requiring multiple moves down and then left.\n\nGiven this, the closest apple is at (8,9), requiring only 3 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake at (6,9). If I move up to (9,9), then left to (8,9), I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or eat the apple first.\n\nAssuming the enemy is stationary or moves in a way that doesn't immediately threaten me, I should proceed towards (8,9).\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move UP to (9,8).\n\n2. Then, move UP again to (9,9).\n\n3. Then, move LEFT to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to intercept me or that I don't run into it.\n\nGiven that, my immediate next move should be UP to (9,8).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{UP}} \\]"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,8). There are apples at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9). Also, there's an enemy snake at (5,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 3,9), then some dots, then 1 (enemy snake at 5,9), more dots, and A at 8,9, and 2 (me at 9,8).\n\nRow 8: Dots, except for me at 9,8.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: All dots.\n\nRow 4: All dots.\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: A at 4,2.\n\nRow 1: A at 1,1 and 4,1.\n\nRow 0: A at 0,9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board state you provided, it seems like the apples and snakes are placed differently. Let me make sure I'm looking at the correct positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 9: A at 0,9; dots; 1 at 5,9; dots; A at 8,9; 2 at 9,8.\n\nRow 8: Dots, except for 2 at 9,8.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: All dots.\n\nRow 4: All dots.\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: A at 4,2.\n\nRow 1: A at 1,1; A at 4,1; dots.\n\nRow 0: A at 0,9.\n\nWait, but in row 9, it shows A at 0,9 and 8,9, and 1 at 5,9, and 2 at 9,8. But according to the apple positions, apples are at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9). So, apple at 8,9 is correct, and at 0,9, and at 1,1, and at 4,2, and at 3,1.\n\nBut in row 9, it shows A at 0,9 and 8,9, and 1 at 5,9, and 2 at 9,8.\n\nIn row 1, it shows A at 1,1 and 4,1, but according to the apple positions, there's an apple at (3,1), not (4,1). Maybe a typo in the board state.\n\nAnyway, I need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nI'm at (9,8), and I can move up, down, left, or right, but I need to make sure not to hit walls or the enemy snake or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-turn game, I need to think about a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple.\n\nThe apples are at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9).\n\nI'm at (9,8). The closest apple seems to be at (8,9), which is just one step up from my current position.\n\nWait, no. If I'm at (9,8), and I look at the board, row 9 is y=9, and I'm at x=9, y=8.\n\nWait, actually, in the board state, row 9 is y=9, and columns are x from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position is (9,8), which is in row 8, column 9.\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's described with row 9 being y=9, and positions like (0,9) being row 9, column 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinate system.\n\nLet me clarify: in the board state, rows are listed from 9 to 0, with row 9 being the top row, and columns from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nTherefore, (9,8) is column 9, row 8, which is in the bottom part of the board.\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, y increases upwards.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I'm at (9,8), which is column 9, row 8, near the top-right part of the board.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,1): column 3, row 1, bottom-middle.\n\n- (8,9): column 8, row 9, top-middle.\n\n- (4,2): column 4, row 2, middle-left.\n\n- (1,1): column 1, row 1, bottom-left.\n\n- (0,9): column 0, row 9, top-left.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,9), top-middle, with no body parts, so just the head.\n\nOkay, so I need to navigate from (9,8) to these apples without hitting walls, the enemy, or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nAt (9,8), I can move:\n\n- Up to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Left to (8,8)\n\n- Right would be (10,8), but that's off the board, so can't move right.\n\nWait, board is 10x10, x from 0 to 9, so right at (9,8) would be out of bounds.\n\nSo, possible moves: up, down, left.\n\nLooking at the board, at (9,9), there's nothing mentioned, but looking at the board state, row 9 has positions 0 to 9, and at (8,9) there's an A (apple), and (5,9) has the enemy snake's head.\n\nWait, in row 9, positions are:\n\n0: A\n\n1: .\n\n2: .\n\n3: .\n\n4: .\n\n5: 1 (enemy snake)\n\n6: .\n\n7: .\n\n8: A (apple)\n\n9: . (I think, since 2 is at 9,8, which is row 8, column 9)\n\nWait, actually, in row 9, it's y=9, so positions (0,9) to (9,9).\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 9: A . . . . 1 . . . A .\n\nSo, (0,9): A\n\n(1,9): .\n\n(2,9): .\n\n(3,9): .\n\n(4,9): .\n\n(5,9): 1 (enemy snake)\n\n(6,9): .\n\n(7,9): .\n\n(8,9): A\n\n(9,9): .\n\nTherefore, at (9,9), which is up from me, it's empty.\n\nSo, I can move up to (9,9).\n\nFrom there, I can see an apple at (8,9), which is left from (9,9).\n\nBut I need to be careful not to collide with the enemy snake at (5,9).\n\nAlso, I need to plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could move down to (9,7), but that might not be the best path to the apples.\n\nLet me think about a strategy.\n\nOption 1: Go up to (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, I can continue left towards (5,9), but need to be careful of the enemy snake.\n\nOption 2: Move down to (9,7), then left towards the apples below.\n\nBut the apples below are at (4,2) and (3,1), which might take more moves.\n\nOption 3: Move diagonally up-left towards the apple at (8,9), but since I can't move diagonally in snake games, I need to move up then left, or left then up.\n\nWait, in this game, can the snake move diagonally? From the rules, it seems like it can only move in cardinal directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nAssuming that, I need to plan a path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple.\n\nI'm at (9,8).\n\nApple at (8,9): distance is 1 up and 1 left, total of 2 moves.\n\nApple at (0,9): distance is 9 left and 1 up, total of 10 moves.\n\nApple at (4,2): distance is 5 left and 6 down, total of 11 moves.\n\nApple at (3,1): distance is 6 left and 7 down, total of 13 moves.\n\nApple at (1,1): distance is 8"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,8). There are apples at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9). Also, there's an enemy snake at (5,9), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 3,9), then some dots, then 1 (enemy snake at 5,9), more dots, and A at 8,9, and 2 (me at 9,8).\n\nRow 8: Dots, except for me at 9,8.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: All dots.\n\nRow 4: All dots.\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: A at 4,2.\n\nRow 1: A at 1,1 and 4,1.\n\nRow 0: A at 0,9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board state you provided, it seems like the apples and snakes are placed differently. Let me make sure I'm looking at the correct positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 9: A at 0,9; dots; 1 at 5,9; dots; A at 8,9; 2 at 9,8.\n\nRow 8: Dots, except for 2 at 9,8.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: All dots.\n\nRow 4: All dots.\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: A at 4,2.\n\nRow 1: A at 1,1; A at 4,1; dots.\n\nRow 0: A at 0,9.\n\nWait, but in row 9, it shows A at 0,9 and 8,9, and 1 at 5,9, and 2 at 9,8. But according to the apple positions, apples are at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9). So, apple at 8,9 is correct, and at 0,9, and at 1,1, and at 4,2, and at 3,1.\n\nBut in row 9, it shows A at 0,9 and 8,9, and 1 at 5,9, and 2 at 9,8.\n\nIn row 1, it shows A at 1,1 and 4,1, but according to the apple positions, there's an apple at (3,1), not (4,1). Maybe a typo in the board state.\n\nAnyway, I need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nI'm at (9,8), and I can move up, down, left, or right, but I need to make sure not to hit walls or the enemy snake or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-turn game, I need to think about a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple.\n\nThe apples are at (3,1), (8,9), (4,2), (1,1), and (0,9).\n\nI'm at (9,8). The closest apple seems to be at (8,9), which is just one step up from my current position.\n\nWait, no. If I'm at (9,8), and I look at the board, row 9 is y=9, and I'm at x=9, y=8.\n\nWait, actually, in the board state, row 9 is y=9, and columns are x from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position is (9,8), which is in row 8, column 9.\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's described with row 9 being y=9, and positions like (0,9) being row 9, column 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinate system.\n\nLet me clarify: in the board state, rows are listed from 9 to 0, with row 9 being the top row, and columns from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nTherefore, (9,8) is column 9, row 8, which is in the bottom part of the board.\n\nWait, but in the board state, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, y increases upwards.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I'm at (9,8), which is column 9, row 8, near the top-right part of the board.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,1): column 3, row 1, bottom-middle.\n\n- (8,9): column 8, row 9, top-middle.\n\n- (4,2): column 4, row 2, middle-left.\n\n- (1,1): column 1, row 1, bottom-left.\n\n- (0,9): column 0, row 9, top-left.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,9), top-middle, with no body parts, so just the head.\n\nOkay, so I need to navigate from (9,8) to these apples without hitting walls, the enemy, or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nAt (9,8), I can move:\n\n- Up to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Left to (8,8)\n\n- Right would be (10,8), but that's off the board, so can't move right.\n\nWait, board is 10x10, x from 0 to 9, so right at (9,8) would be out of bounds.\n\nSo, possible moves: up, down, left.\n\nLooking at the board, at (9,9), there's nothing mentioned, but looking at the board state, row 9 has positions 0 to 9, and at (8,9) there's an A (apple), and (5,9) has the enemy snake's head.\n\nWait, in row 9, positions are:\n\n0: A\n\n1: .\n\n2: .\n\n3: .\n\n4: .\n\n5: 1 (enemy snake)\n\n6: .\n\n7: .\n\n8: A (apple)\n\n9: . (I think, since 2 is at 9,8, which is row 8, column 9)\n\nWait, actually, in row 9, it's y=9, so positions (0,9) to (9,9).\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 9: A . . . . 1 . . . A .\n\nSo, (0,9): A\n\n(1,9): .\n\n(2,9): .\n\n(3,9): .\n\n(4,9): .\n\n(5,9): 1 (enemy snake)\n\n(6,9): .\n\n(7,9): .\n\n(8,9): A\n\n(9,9): .\n\nTherefore, at (9,9), which is up from me, it's empty.\n\nSo, I can move up to (9,9).\n\nFrom there, I can see an apple at (8,9), which is left from (9,9).\n\nBut I need to be careful not to collide with the enemy snake at (5,9).\n\nAlso, I need to plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could move down to (9,7), but that might not be the best path to the apples.\n\nLet me think about a strategy.\n\nOption 1: Go up to (9,9), then left to (8,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, I can continue left towards (5,9), but need to be careful of the enemy snake.\n\nOption 2: Move down to (9,7), then left towards the apples below.\n\nBut the apples below are at (4,2) and (3,1), which might take more moves.\n\nOption 3: Move diagonally up-left towards the apple at (8,9), but since I can't move diagonally in snake games, I need to move up then left, or left then up.\n\nWait, in this game, can the snake move diagonally? From the rules, it seems like it can only move in cardinal directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nAssuming that, I need to plan a path accordingly.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple.\n\nI'm at (9,8).\n\nApple at (8,9): distance is 1 up and 1 left, total of 2 moves.\n\nApple at (0,9): distance is 9 left and 1 up, total of 10 moves.\n\nApple at (4,2): distance is 5 left and 6 down, total of 11 moves.\n\nApple at (3,1): distance is 6 left and 7 down, total of 13 moves.\n\nApple at (1,1): distance is 8"
