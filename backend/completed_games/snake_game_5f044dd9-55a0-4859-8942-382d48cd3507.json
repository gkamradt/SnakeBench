I'll remain within the boundaries and can safely aim for the (0, 5) apple.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Proceed to the apple at (0, 5) unimpeded.\n   - Monitor the movements of Snake #2; though it is far, unforeseen rapid movements could need reassessment of strategy.\n   - After collecting the apple at (0, 5), reassess the board. Given Snake #2\u2019s position and my location, prioritize the next closest apple such that my route doesn't lead to collisions or dead-ends.\n\nWith these considerations, the wise choice is to continue the safe and straightforward path towards the apple at (0, 5).\n\nNext Move: DOWN"
