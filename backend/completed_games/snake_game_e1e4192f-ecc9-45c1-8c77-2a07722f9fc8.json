The enemy snake (ID 2) has moved to (2, 5) with its body at [(2, 4)], still not posing an immediate threat.\n3. The apple at (5, 0) is now 1 unit to the right and 3 units down.\n4. Moving right again would be the most efficient way to reach the apple, as it is in the same row as my snake.\n5. After collecting the apple at (5, 0), I should assess the situation and plan my next move based on the enemy snake's position and the remaining apples on the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- After moving right and collecting the apple at (5, 0), evaluate the enemy snake's position and the remaining apples.\n- If the enemy snake moves closer or poses a threat, prioritize safety and consider alternative routes to the nearest apple.\n- Keep an eye on the remaining apples and plan ahead to maintain a strategic position on the board, especially the apples at (8, 6) and (9, 4), which are relatively close to each other.\n- Consider the possibility of trapping the enemy snake or cutting off its path to the apples, if the opportunity arises.\n\nConsidering the current situation, the best move is to go right once more. This will allow me to collect the apple at (5, 0) and grow my snake while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake and the walls.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
