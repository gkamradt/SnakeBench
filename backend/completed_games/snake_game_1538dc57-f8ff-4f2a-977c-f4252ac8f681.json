It's directly below within range of a straight move down.\n- **Enemy Snake**: Still located at (6, 2), does not currently threaten me directly unless it moves significantly closer.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Move Down**: Safely reach the apple at (7, 2). This is a straightforward and safe path since there is no obstacle or threat in the way.\n2. **Monitor Enemy Movements**: Keep an eye on Snake #2 to ensure it doesn't move unpredictably that could threaten my path.\n3. **Future Planning**: After getting the apple at (7, 2), consider the apple at (7, 0) by continuing downwards. Assess surroundings before making further moves.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: DOWN"

Moving RIGHT to (7, 2) is still the optimal choice because:\n- It's the closest apple\n- I'm just one move away from getting it\n- The enemy snake is far away and not a threat\n- After getting this apple, I can decide between going for (9, 2) on the same level or (9, 3) just above\n\nNext turn reminder: After moving right and collecting the apple at (7, 2), I'll have two good options:\n1. Continue RIGHT towards (9, 2)\n2. Move UP towards (9, 3)\nThe choice will depend on the enemy snake's position and movements.\n\nRIGHT"
