The apple at (9, 9) remains the most accessible, but I will need to navigate one step at a time toward it.\n3. **Enemy Position:** Snake #2 is now at (9, 9) with their body at (8, 9). Considering their position, I must be cautious if I approach (9, 9) next since it is also the location of an enemy snake. Therefore, I need to ensure I'm not close to the enemy snake, especially as I approach that area.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n- Up to (9, 4): This move is valid and would not conflict with any obstacles or enemy presence and keeps me focused on my upward trajectory.\n- Down to (9, 2): This moves me back and away from the target area, and I lose potential points from apples.\n- Left to (8, 3): This is also valid as it gives me room to explore nearby apples at (2, 1). But I'd rather keep heading upward.\n- Right to (10, 3): This is invalid since it is out of bounds.\n\nFollowing the situations of potential moves, moving **up** to (9, 4) seems the best move, as it keeps me heading toward the target area without immediately intersecting with the enemy snake while still on track to reach any other available apples.\n\n**Strategy Reminder:** In my next turn, I will aim to maintain my upward momentum whilst being vigilant about enemy locations. I must take care to observe further moves to avoid cutting too close to the enemy snake or to prevent being cornered.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"
