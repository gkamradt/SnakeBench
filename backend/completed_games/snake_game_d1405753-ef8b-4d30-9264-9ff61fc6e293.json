This will give me 1 point and grow my snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating this apple, I'll need to decide which apple to go for next. The apple at (2, 1) is close to the enemy snake, so I might want to avoid that one for now. The apple at (6, 7) is a bit far, but it might be a good option if I can get there before the enemy snake does.

For example, if we go RIGHT to (4,1) next, we\u2019ll then be one move away from (4,0) (by moving DOWN on our following move) to capture that apple and grow. Alternatively, going DOWN from (3,1) would get us to (3,0), from where a RIGHT move would also immediately grab (4,0). Either option is viable, but moving RIGHT first keeps us more centered and gives us additional escape options if needed.\n\nOur enemy snake #2 (currently at (8,0) with a body piece at (8,1)) poses no immediate threat here, so our best strategy is to head toward the nearest apple.\n\nThus, our next move is: RIGHT."
