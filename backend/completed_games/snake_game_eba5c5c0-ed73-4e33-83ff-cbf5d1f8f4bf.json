            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (7,2) with an empty body. The apples are at (9,3), (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (6,7) with no body either. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's check the positions. The closest apples might be (2,4) and (0,7). Wait, (2,4) is two steps left and two up from my current position (7,2). To get there, I need to move left and up. But let's calculate the distance. From (7,2) to (2,4): the x difference is 5 left, y difference is 2 up. So Manhattan distance is 7. Hmm. Alternatively, (0,7) is 7 left and 5 up. That's even further. The apple at (9,3) is to the right and up. From (7,2), moving right two and up one. That's a Manhattan distance of 3. That's closer. Oh, right, (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. So from (7,2), moving right twice and up once. So that's a shorter path. But wait, moving right would take me towards (9,3). Let me check the path. If I go right to (8,2), then right again to (9,2), then up to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, maybe I can go up first. If I go up to (7,3), then right twice to (9,3). That's also three moves. Either way. But maybe the enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my immediate path. So maybe the apple at (9,3) is the best target. Also, the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (7,2), moving down two and right two. But that's a longer path. So (9,3) seems the closest.\n\nWait, but the snake is at (7,2). Let me check possible directions. The possible moves are UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2). Which direction gets me closer to (9,3). If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (7,3), then RIGHT twice. Also three moves. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a straight path. Also, moving right now would take me towards the apple. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. Let's check the next steps. If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (9,2). Then UP to (9,3) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP now, then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. Wait, no. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. So total of three moves as well. Hmm. So either path is the same length. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a direct approach. Also, if I go right now, I can get closer to the apple. Let me check if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my path. The other apples are further away. So moving towards (9,3) seems the best option. So the first move should be RIGHT. Wait, but what about the apple at (3,9)? That's at the top middle. From (7,2), that's left 4 and up 7. That's a longer path. So not worth it right now. The apple at (0,7) is even further. So (9,3) is the closest. So direction RIGHT. But wait, what if I go UP first? Let's see. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go RIGHT twice and then UP once. Either way. But maybe moving right first is better. Because if I go right now, then next move right again, then up. But after moving right to (8,2), the next move to (9,2) is possible. Then up to (9,3). So that's three steps. Alternatively, if I go up first, then right twice. Both paths are safe. So which is better? Maybe the path that allows me to collect other apples next. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. So moving right first. So direction RIGHT. But wait, the apple at (9,0) is also in the same column. But that's down. From (7,2), moving down to (7,1) then right to (8,1), etc. But that's a longer path. So not worth it. So the best move is RIGHT towards (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But let me check if moving right is safe. The next position would be (8,2). Is there any snake there? The enemy snake is at (6,7), so no. The body is empty. So (8,2) is safe. Then moving right again to (9,2). Then up to (9,3). All safe. So yes. So the first move should be RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me think again. If I go UP first, then I can reach (7,3), then right twice. But maybe that's the same. So either direction is okay. But perhaps moving right first is better because it's a straight line towards the apple. So I'll choose RIGHT. The next move would be RIGHT again, then UP. So the first move is RIGHT. That's the direction to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body.\n\nSo, my current position is (8,2). The closest apple is (9,3), which is one step right and one up from here. If I move right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3). Either way, two moves. But since I'm at (8,2), moving right to (9,2) would get me closer. Then next turn, I can go up to eat the apple. But wait, moving right now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge of the board. Then next move up to (9,3) is safe. But I need to make sure there's no collision. The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) would also be a step towards the apple. Then right to (9,3). That's also two moves. Which path is better? Both are the same distance, but moving right first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple's x-coordinate. Also, after eating the apple at (9,3), I can consider other apples. \n\nWait, but if I move right to (9,2), then next move up to (9,3) to get the apple. That would grow my body. Then I need to avoid running into myself. But since my body is currently empty, after eating the apple, my body would be at (9,3), but the next move would be to leave that spot. So no immediate danger. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples nearby after getting (9,3)? The next closest might be (3,9) or (0,7). But those are further. Alternatively, after (9,3), maybe (9,0) is another apple in the same column. But that's down from (9,3) to (9,0), which is three steps down. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,3), maybe head towards (3,9) which is at the top. But that's a long way. So perhaps after getting (9,3), the next move would be to plan for another apple. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. \n\nSo the best move now is RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But wait, moving right from (8,2) to (9,2) is valid. No snakes or walls there. So that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP now to (8,3), then next move right to (9,3). That's one step less. Wait, no. From (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then right to (9,3) would take two moves. Same as moving right then up. So both paths take two moves. But moving right first allows me to be on the same x as the apple, which might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be better in case there's a risk of the enemy snake approaching. But the enemy is at (5,7), which is not near. So either direction is safe. \n\nHmm. So the decision is between RIGHT or UP. Which is better? Let's think about possible next steps. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move UP to (9,3). Then after eating the apple, I can go left to (8,3) or down to (9,2) (but that's my previous position, which is safe since my body hasn't grown yet). Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after eating the apple at (9,3), my body would be at (9,3), and the next move would extend. So if I go right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) (eating the apple), then the next move would be to move in a direction that doesn't hit myself. For example, if I go left to (8,3), that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3) (eating the apple), then next move could be up to (9,4) or right (but right is a wall). So up would be better. \n\nBut both paths are valid. However, moving right first might be better because it positions me closer to the edge, which could be a risk if I can't turn, but in this case, after moving right to (9,2), I can still go up. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer in case there's an unexpected obstacle. But given the current board, both are safe. \n\nSince both options are equally good, but the apple is at (9,3), moving right now would take me closer in x-coordinate. So I'll choose RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT, which took me from (7,2) to (8,2). Now, moving RIGHT again to (9,2) is possible. Then next move UP to (9,3). That's the plan.

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's check the positions. The closest apples might be (2,4) and (0,7). Wait, (2,4) is two steps left and two up from my current position (7,2). To get there, I need to move left and up. But let's calculate the distance. From (7,2) to (2,4): the x difference is 5 left, y difference is 2 up. So Manhattan distance is 7. Hmm. Alternatively, (0,7) is 7 left and 5 up. That's even further. The apple at (9,3) is to the right and up. From (7,2), moving right two and up one. That's a Manhattan distance of 3. That's closer. Oh, right, (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. So from (7,2), moving right twice and up once. So that's a shorter path. But wait, moving right would take me towards (9,3). Let me check the path. If I go right to (8,2), then right again to (9,2), then up to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, maybe I can go up first. If I go up to (7,3), then right twice to (9,3). That's also three moves. Either way. But maybe the enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my immediate path. So maybe the apple at (9,3) is the best target. Also, the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (7,2), moving down two and right two. But that's a longer path. So (9,3) seems the closest.\n\nWait, but the snake is at (7,2). Let me check possible directions. The possible moves are UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2). Which direction gets me closer to (9,3). If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (7,3), then RIGHT twice. Also three moves. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a straight path. Also, moving right now would take me towards the apple. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. Let's check the next steps. If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (9,2). Then UP to (9,3) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP now, then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. Wait, no. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. So total of three moves as well. Hmm. So either path is the same length. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a direct approach. Also, if I go right now, I can get closer to the apple. Let me check if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my path. The other apples are further away. So moving towards (9,3) seems the best option. So the first move should be RIGHT. Wait, but what about the apple at (3,9)? That's at the top middle. From (7,2), that's left 4 and up 7. That's a longer path. So not worth it right now. The apple at (0,7) is even further. So (9,3) is the closest. So direction RIGHT. But wait, what if I go UP first? Let's see. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go RIGHT twice and then UP once. Either way. But maybe moving right first is better. Because if I go right now, then next move right again, then up. But after moving right to (8,2), the next move to (9,2) is possible. Then up to (9,3). So that's three steps. Alternatively, if I go up first, then right twice. Both paths are safe. So which is better? Maybe the path that allows me to collect other apples next. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. So moving right first. So direction RIGHT. But wait, the apple at (9,0) is also in the same column. But that's down. From (7,2), moving down to (7,1) then right to (8,1), etc. But that's a longer path. So not worth it. So the best move is RIGHT towards (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But let me check if moving right is safe. The next position would be (8,2). Is there any snake there? The enemy snake is at (6,7), so no. The body is empty. So (8,2) is safe. Then moving right again to (9,2). Then up to (9,3). All safe. So yes. So the first move should be RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me think again. If I go UP first, then I can reach (7,3), then right twice. But maybe that's the same. So either direction is okay. But perhaps moving right first is better because it's a straight line towards the apple. So I'll choose RIGHT. The next move would be RIGHT again, then UP. So the first move is RIGHT. That's the direction to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body.\n\nSo, my current position is (8,2). The closest apple is (9,3), which is one step right and one up from here. If I move right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3). Either way, two moves. But since I'm at (8,2), moving right to (9,2) would get me closer. Then next turn, I can go up to eat the apple. But wait, moving right now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge of the board. Then next move up to (9,3) is safe. But I need to make sure there's no collision. The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) would also be a step towards the apple. Then right to (9,3). That's also two moves. Which path is better? Both are the same distance, but moving right first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple's x-coordinate. Also, after eating the apple at (9,3), I can consider other apples. \n\nWait, but if I move right to (9,2), then next move up to (9,3) to get the apple. That would grow my body. Then I need to avoid running into myself. But since my body is currently empty, after eating the apple, my body would be at (9,3), but the next move would be to leave that spot. So no immediate danger. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples nearby after getting (9,3)? The next closest might be (3,9) or (0,7). But those are further. Alternatively, after (9,3), maybe (9,0) is another apple in the same column. But that's down from (9,3) to (9,0), which is three steps down. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,3), maybe head towards (3,9) which is at the top. But that's a long way. So perhaps after getting (9,3), the next move would be to plan for another apple. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. \n\nSo the best move now is RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But wait, moving right from (8,2) to (9,2) is valid. No snakes or walls there. So that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP now to (8,3), then next move right to (9,3). That's one step less. Wait, no. From (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then right to (9,3) would take two moves. Same as moving right then up. So both paths take two moves. But moving right first allows me to be on the same x as the apple, which might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be better in case there's a risk of the enemy snake approaching. But the enemy is at (5,7), which is not near. So either direction is safe. \n\nHmm. So the decision is between RIGHT or UP. Which is better? Let's think about possible next steps. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move UP to (9,3). Then after eating the apple, I can go left to (8,3) or down to (9,2) (but that's my previous position, which is safe since my body hasn't grown yet). Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after eating the apple at (9,3), my body would be at (9,3), and the next move would extend. So if I go right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) (eating the apple), then the next move would be to move in a direction that doesn't hit myself. For example, if I go left to (8,3), that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3) (eating the apple), then next move could be up to (9,4) or right (but right is a wall). So up would be better. \n\nBut both paths are valid. However, moving right first might be better because it positions me closer to the edge, which could be a risk if I can't turn, but in this case, after moving right to (9,2), I can still go up. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer in case there's an unexpected obstacle. But given the current board, both are safe. \n\nSince both options are equally good, but the apple is at (9,3), moving right now would take me closer in x-coordinate. So I'll choose RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT, which took me from (7,2) to (8,2). Now, moving RIGHT again to (9,2) is possible. Then next move UP to (9,3). That's the plan.

The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body.\n\nSo, my current position is (8,2). The closest apple is (9,3), which is one step right and one up from here. If I move right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3). Either way, two moves. But since I'm at (8,2), moving right to (9,2) would get me closer. Then next turn, I can go up to eat the apple. But wait, moving right now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge of the board. Then next move up to (9,3) is safe. But I need to make sure there's no collision. The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) would also be a step towards the apple. Then right to (9,3). That's also two moves. Which path is better? Both are the same distance, but moving right first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple's x-coordinate. Also, after eating the apple at (9,3), I can consider other apples. \n\nWait, but if I move right to (9,2), then next move up to (9,3) to get the apple. That would grow my body. Then I need to avoid running into myself. But since my body is currently empty, after eating the apple, my body would be at (9,3), but the next move would be to leave that spot. So no immediate danger. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples nearby after getting (9,3)? The next closest might be (3,9) or (0,7). But those are further. Alternatively, after (9,3), maybe (9,0) is another apple in the same column. But that's down from (9,3) to (9,0), which is three steps down. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,3), maybe head towards (3,9) which is at the top. But that's a long way. So perhaps after getting (9,3), the next move would be to plan for another apple. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. \n\nSo the best move now is RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But wait, moving right from (8,2) to (9,2) is valid. No snakes or walls there. So that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP now to (8,3), then next move right to (9,3). That's one step less. Wait, no. From (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then right to (9,3) would take two moves. Same as moving right then up. So both paths take two moves. But moving right first allows me to be on the same x as the apple, which might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be better in case there's a risk of the enemy snake approaching. But the enemy is at (5,7), which is not near. So either direction is safe. \n\nHmm. So the decision is between RIGHT or UP. Which is better? Let's think about possible next steps. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move UP to (9,3). Then after eating the apple, I can go left to (8,3) or down to (9,2) (but that's my previous position, which is safe since my body hasn't grown yet). Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after eating the apple at (9,3), my body would be at (9,3), and the next move would extend. So if I go right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) (eating the apple), then the next move would be to move in a direction that doesn't hit myself. For example, if I go left to (8,3), that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3) (eating the apple), then next move could be up to (9,4) or right (but right is a wall). So up would be better. \n\nBut both paths are valid. However, moving right first might be better because it positions me closer to the edge, which could be a risk if I can't turn, but in this case, after moving right to (9,2), I can still go up. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer in case there's an unexpected obstacle. But given the current board, both are safe. \n\nSince both options are equally good, but the apple is at (9,3), moving right now would take me closer in x-coordinate. So I'll choose RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT, which took me from (7,2) to (8,2). Now, moving RIGHT again to (9,2) is possible. Then next move UP to (9,3). That's the plan. So the direction is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (9,3) with the body part at (9,2). The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). Wait, the board state shows an apple at (9,9) as well? Wait, the user listed apples at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). But in the board diagram, there's an A at (9,9) in row 9, which is (3,9) maybe? Let me check again.\n\nThe board state shows row 9 as \". . . A . . . . . .\", which would be x=3, y=9. So that's (3,9), which is one of the listed apples. The other apples are at (0,7) (row 7, x=0), (9,0) (row 0, x=9), (2,4) (row 4, x=2), (1,1) (row 1, x=1). So the available apples are those positions.\n\nMy snake is at (9,3) with body at [(9,2)]. So the head is at (9,3), and the tail is at (9,2). So the snake is moving upwards, since the body is behind it. Wait, the last move was UP, which moved the head from (9,2) to (9,3) in the previous step. Now, the current position is head at (9,3), body at (9,2). So the snake is facing UP, because moving from (9,2) to (9,3) was UP. So the next move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (4,6) with body at []. So their head is at (4,6), no body. So they're just a single segment. They might be moving towards apples as well.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples without dying. Let's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent head at (9,3). Possible directions:\n\nUP: to (9,4). Is that within the grid? Yes, since y ranges from 0 to 9. So (9,4) is valid. Are there any apples there? Looking at the apples list, no. So moving UP would not collect an apple. But maybe there's an apple nearby. Wait, the apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest apple to (9,3) is (9,0) but that's far down. The next closest might be (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. But that's quite a distance. Alternatively, (1,1) is at the bottom left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,9) but according to the list, that's (3,9). Wait, the user's listed apples include (3,9), which is x=3, y=9. So that's in the top middle. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=3 would take a while. \n\nSo the immediate options are to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nUP: (9,4). Is that safe? No enemies there. Also, my own body is at (9,2) and (9,3) is the head. So moving to (9,4) would not collide with myself. So that's safe.\n\nDOWN: (9,2). That's where the body is. So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. That's a death. So can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (8,3). Is that safe? Let's check. Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (4,6), which is far away. So (8,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (10,3) which is outside the grid. So that's a wall. Can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple? Let's see. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest ones are (9,0) which is way down, but moving down would require going through (9,2) which is the body. So that's not possible. The other apples are (3,9) which is up and to the left. So moving UP would take me to (9,4), then maybe continue left towards (8,4), etc., but that's a long path. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (8,3) and then proceeding left towards (7,3), etc., but that's not directly towards any apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. So to reach that, I need to move left from (9,3) towards x=3, but y needs to go up to 9. So moving left and up. Alternatively, the apple at (2,4) is at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left to x=2 and up to y=4. That's a possible path. But that's 7 steps left and 1 up. So maybe moving left towards that direction.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is at x=1, y=1. That's down and left. But moving down would hit the body. So not possible.\n\nThe apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. That's up and left. From (9,3), moving left and up. So perhaps moving left towards (8,3), then (7,3), etc., while moving up towards y=7.\n\nBut which direction now gives the best path towards an apple without getting stuck?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,0) which is at the bottom right. But to get there, I need to move down from (9,3) to (9,2), which is my body. So that's impossible. So that apple is not reachable unless I can loop around, but with the current body, moving down is blocked.\n\nSo the available apples are (3,9), (2,4), (0,7), (1,1). The closest is (2,4) at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=2 and up to y=4. So moving left (to x=8, then 7, etc.) and up (to y=4). So the first step could be LEFT to (8,3), then next steps continue left and up.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nWhich path is safer? Let's consider possible risks. The enemy snake is at (4,6). They might be moving towards apples as well. But they are far away. So immediate danger is low.\n\nSo the options are UP or LEFT. Which one is better?\n\nIf I move UP to (9,4), then next move could be LEFT to (8,4), then continue left. That path might lead towards the apple at (3,9) but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving LEFT now to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then left again. Either way, the path is similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. So moving left from (9,3) to x=3 would take 6 steps left (from 9 to 3), and moving up from y=3 to 9 would take 6 steps up. So that's a long path. The apple at (2,4) is x=2, y=4. So moving left 7 steps and up 1 step. That's a longer left move but less up.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is x=0, y=7. So moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's even further.\n\nSo perhaps the closest apple is (2,4). Let's check the distance. From (9,3) to (2,4): Manhattan distance is (9-2)+(4-3)=7+1=8. To (3,9): (9-3)+(9-3)=6+6=12. To (0,7): 9+4=13. So (2,4) is the closest.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (2,4). To get there, I need to move left and up. So from (9,3), moving LEFT to (8,3) is a step in that direction. Then next steps would continue left and maybe up. Alternatively, moving UP first to (9,4), then left. But moving UP first might not be as efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now starts the journey towards (2,4). Let's see: if I move LEFT to (8,3), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. But to reach (2,4), I need to eventually move up once. So perhaps moving LEFT now is better.\n\nBut wait, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) would be moving towards (2,4) as well. The Manhattan distance from (9,4) to (2,4) is 7 in x-direction, same as from (8,3) to (2,4) which is 6 in x and 1 in y. So both are similar. But moving LEFT first reduces the x distance more quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards the same apple. But since they are at (4,6), they might be heading towards (2,4) as well. So perhaps moving towards (2,4) could lead to a collision. But given that the enemy is at (4,6), they are closer to (2,4) than I am. So maybe that's not the best target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. But that's further away. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go LEFT to (8,3) to start moving towards the center, which gives more options. Then, from there, I can decide to go UP or continue LEFT based on the next board state.\n\nBut since the current move needs to be decided now, between UP and LEFT.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move UP to (9,4), then next turn I can move LEFT to (8,4), which is a step towards (2,4). But moving UP now doesn't collect any apple. Moving LEFT now also doesn't collect an apple, but starts the journey towards (2,4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple I can reach in fewer steps. Let me check the apples again. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). From (9,3), the closest is (2,4) as discussed. The next closest is (3,9) which is 6 left and 6 up. So moving towards (2,4) is better.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT towards (2,4). So the next move should be LEFT to (8,3). That's safe, no collision. Then, next turn, move LEFT again to (7,3), and so on. But need to check if that's the best path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) might also be a path. But which is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I go LEFT now: (9,3) \u2192 (8,3). Next move could be LEFT to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. To reach (2,4), I need to go up once. So after moving left 7 times to (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 8 moves.\n\nIf I go UP now: (9,3) \u2192 (9,4). Then LEFT to (8,4), then left to (7,4), etc. To reach (2,4), need to go left 7 times from (9,4) to (2,4). That's 7 moves left. So total 8 moves (1 up +7 left). Same as the other path.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving LEFT first starts reducing the x-coordinate immediately, which might be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple that becomes reachable along the way. For example, if I move left to (8,3), then up to (8,4), which is closer to (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is moving towards (2,4) as well. If they are at (4,6), moving down and left could reach (2,4) in a few steps. So perhaps that apple is risky. Maybe I should target a different apple.\n\nLooking at (3,9), which is at x=3, y=9. From (9,3), moving left to x=3 (6 steps) and up to y=9 (6 steps). That's a longer path, but maybe safer if the enemy isn't heading there.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. From (9,3), moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's a long way, but maybe possible.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (4,6), they might be closer to (0,7) as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (2,4), even if there's a risk. Because otherwise, the enemy might get it first, and I need to collect points.\n\nSo, given that, moving LEFT now to (8,3) is a step towards (2,4). That seems reasonable.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT to (8,3), the body will be at (9,3) and (9,2). Wait, no. Wait, the current body is [(9,2)], and the head is at (9,3). So when I move LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)]. Wait, no. When the snake moves, the tail follows. Since the snake's body is only [(9,2)] and the head is at (9,3), moving the head to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3), (9,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2 (head at (9,3), body at (9,2)), then moving LEFT to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) would move to (9,3) if the snake didn't eat an apple. Wait, but the snake only grows when it eats an apple. So in this case, moving to (8,3) does not eat an apple, so the snake's length remains 2. So the new head is (8,3), and the body is [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the head moves, each body segment moves into the previous position. So if the snake is [ (9,3) (head), (9,2) (body) ], then moving LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [ (9,3) ], and the tail (9,2) is removed. So the snake's length remains 2. So after moving LEFT, the snake is at (8,3) with body at [(9,3)]. So the next move, if I move LEFT again, the body would be [(8,3), (9,3)], etc.\n\nBut in this case, moving LEFT to (8,3) is safe. No collision with self or others. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) is also safe. But no apple there. So which is better? Moving towards the apple or exploring.\n\nSince the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the nearest one is better. So LEFT is better.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's check the positions. The closest apples might be (2,4) and (0,7). Wait, (2,4) is two steps left and two up from my current position (7,2). To get there, I need to move left and up. But let's calculate the distance. From (7,2) to (2,4): the x difference is 5 left, y difference is 2 up. So Manhattan distance is 7. Hmm. Alternatively, (0,7) is 7 left and 5 up. That's even further. The apple at (9,3) is to the right and up. From (7,2), moving right two and up one. That's a Manhattan distance of 3. That's closer. Oh, right, (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. So from (7,2), moving right twice and up once. So that's a shorter path. But wait, moving right would take me towards (9,3). Let me check the path. If I go right to (8,2), then right again to (9,2), then up to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, maybe I can go up first. If I go up to (7,3), then right twice to (9,3). That's also three moves. Either way. But maybe the enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my immediate path. So maybe the apple at (9,3) is the best target. Also, the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (7,2), moving down two and right two. But that's a longer path. So (9,3) seems the closest.\n\nWait, but the snake is at (7,2). Let me check possible directions. The possible moves are UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2). Which direction gets me closer to (9,3). If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (7,3), then RIGHT twice. Also three moves. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a straight path. Also, moving right now would take me towards the apple. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. Let's check the next steps. If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (9,2). Then UP to (9,3) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP now, then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. Wait, no. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. So total of three moves as well. Hmm. So either path is the same length. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a direct approach. Also, if I go right now, I can get closer to the apple. Let me check if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my path. The other apples are further away. So moving towards (9,3) seems the best option. So the first move should be RIGHT. Wait, but what about the apple at (3,9)? That's at the top middle. From (7,2), that's left 4 and up 7. That's a longer path. So not worth it right now. The apple at (0,7) is even further. So (9,3) is the closest. So direction RIGHT. But wait, what if I go UP first? Let's see. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go RIGHT twice and then UP once. Either way. But maybe moving right first is better. Because if I go right now, then next move right again, then up. But after moving right to (8,2), the next move to (9,2) is possible. Then up to (9,3). So that's three steps. Alternatively, if I go up first, then right twice. Both paths are safe. So which is better? Maybe the path that allows me to collect other apples next. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. So moving right first. So direction RIGHT. But wait, the apple at (9,0) is also in the same column. But that's down. From (7,2), moving down to (7,1) then right to (8,1), etc. But that's a longer path. So not worth it. So the best move is RIGHT towards (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But let me check if moving right is safe. The next position would be (8,2). Is there any snake there? The enemy snake is at (6,7), so no. The body is empty. So (8,2) is safe. Then moving right again to (9,2). Then up to (9,3). All safe. So yes. So the first move should be RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me think again. If I go UP first, then I can reach (7,3), then right twice. But maybe that's the same. So either direction is okay. But perhaps moving right first is better because it's a straight line towards the apple. So I'll choose RIGHT. The next move would be RIGHT again, then UP. So the first move is RIGHT. That's the direction to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

It opens future paths toward (0, 7).\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (8,2) after moving right last time. The apples are still at (9,3), (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body.\n\nSo, my current position is (8,2). The closest apple is (9,3), which is one step right and one up from here. If I move right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3). Either way, two moves. But since I'm at (8,2), moving right to (9,2) would get me closer. Then next turn, I can go up to eat the apple. But wait, moving right now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge of the board. Then next move up to (9,3) is safe. But I need to make sure there's no collision. The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) would also be a step towards the apple. Then right to (9,3). That's also two moves. Which path is better? Both are the same distance, but moving right first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple's x-coordinate. Also, after eating the apple at (9,3), I can consider other apples. \n\nWait, but if I move right to (9,2), then next move up to (9,3) to get the apple. That would grow my body. Then I need to avoid running into myself. But since my body is currently empty, after eating the apple, my body would be at (9,3), but the next move would be to leave that spot. So no immediate danger. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples nearby after getting (9,3)? The next closest might be (3,9) or (0,7). But those are further. Alternatively, after (9,3), maybe (9,0) is another apple in the same column. But that's down from (9,3) to (9,0), which is three steps down. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,3), maybe head towards (3,9) which is at the top. But that's a long way. So perhaps after getting (9,3), the next move would be to plan for another apple. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. \n\nSo the best move now is RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But wait, moving right from (8,2) to (9,2) is valid. No snakes or walls there. So that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP now to (8,3), then next move right to (9,3). That's one step less. Wait, no. From (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then right to (9,3) would take two moves. Same as moving right then up. So both paths take two moves. But moving right first allows me to be on the same x as the apple, which might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be better in case there's a risk of the enemy snake approaching. But the enemy is at (5,7), which is not near. So either direction is safe. \n\nHmm. So the decision is between RIGHT or UP. Which is better? Let's think about possible next steps. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move UP to (9,3). Then after eating the apple, I can go left to (8,3) or down to (9,2) (but that's my previous position, which is safe since my body hasn't grown yet). Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after eating the apple at (9,3), my body would be at (9,3), and the next move would extend. So if I go right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) (eating the apple), then the next move would be to move in a direction that doesn't hit myself. For example, if I go left to (8,3), that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3) (eating the apple), then next move could be up to (9,4) or right (but right is a wall). So up would be better. \n\nBut both paths are valid. However, moving right first might be better because it positions me closer to the edge, which could be a risk if I can't turn, but in this case, after moving right to (9,2), I can still go up. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer in case there's an unexpected obstacle. But given the current board, both are safe. \n\nSince both options are equally good, but the apple is at (9,3), moving right now would take me closer in x-coordinate. So I'll choose RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT, which took me from (7,2) to (8,2). Now, moving RIGHT again to (9,2) is possible. Then next move UP to (9,3). That's the plan. So the direction is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Wait, the board state shows an apple at (9,9) as well? Wait, the user listed apples at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). But in the board diagram, there's an A at (9,9) in row 9, which is (3,9) maybe? Let me check again.\n\nThe board state shows row 9 as \". . . A . . . . . .\", which would be x=3, y=9. So that's (3,9), which is one of the listed apples. The other apples are at (0,7) (row 7, x=0), (9,0) (row 0, x=9), (2,4) (row 4, x=2), (1,1) (row 1, x=1). So the available apples are those positions.\n\nMy snake is at (9,3) with body at [(9,2)]. So the head is at (9,3), and the tail is at (9,2). So the snake is moving upwards, since the body is behind it. Wait, the last move was UP, which moved the head from (9,2) to (9,3) in the previous step. Now, the current position is head at (9,3), body at (9,2). So the snake is facing UP, because moving from (9,2) to (9,3) was UP. So the next move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (4,6) with body at []. So their head is at (4,6), no body. So they're just a single segment. They might be moving towards apples as well.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples without dying. Let's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent head at (9,3). Possible directions:\n\nUP: to (9,4). Is that within the grid? Yes, since y ranges from 0 to 9. So (9,4) is valid. Are there any apples there? Looking at the apples list, no. So moving UP would not collect an apple. But maybe there's an apple nearby. Wait, the apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest apple to (9,3) is (9,0) but that's far down. The next closest might be (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. But that's quite a distance. Alternatively, (1,1) is at the bottom left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,9) but according to the list, that's (3,9). Wait, the user's listed apples include (3,9), which is x=3, y=9. So that's in the top middle. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=3 would take a while. \n\nSo the immediate options are to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nUP: (9,4). Is that safe? No enemies there. Also, my own body is at (9,2) and (9,3) is the head. So moving to (9,4) would not collide with myself. So that's safe.\n\nDOWN: (9,2). That's where the body is. So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. That's a death. So can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (8,3). Is that safe? Let's check. Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (4,6), which is far away. So (8,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (10,3) which is outside the grid. So that's a wall. Can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple? Let's see. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest ones are (9,0) which is way down, but moving down would require going through (9,2) which is the body. So that's not possible. The other apples are (3,9) which is up and to the left. So moving UP would take me to (9,4), then maybe continue left towards (8,4), etc., but that's a long path. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (8,3) and then proceeding left towards (7,3), etc., but that's not directly towards any apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. So to reach that, I need to move left from (9,3) towards x=3, but y needs to go up to 9. So moving left and up. Alternatively, the apple at (2,4) is at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left to x=2 and up to y=4. That's a possible path. But that's 7 steps left and 1 up. So maybe moving left towards that direction.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is at x=1, y=1. That's down and left. But moving down would hit the body. So not possible.\n\nThe apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. That's up and left. From (9,3), moving left and up. So perhaps moving left towards (8,3), then (7,3), etc., while moving up towards y=7.\n\nBut which direction now gives the best path towards an apple without getting stuck?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,0) which is at the bottom right. But to get there, I need to move down from (9,3) to (9,2), which is my body. So that's impossible. So that apple is not reachable unless I can loop around, but with the current body, moving down is blocked.\n\nSo the available apples are (3,9), (2,4), (0,7), (1,1). The closest is (2,4) at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=2 and up to y=4. So moving left (to x=8, then 7, etc.) and up (to y=4). So the first step could be LEFT to (8,3), then next steps continue left and up.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nWhich path is safer? Let's consider possible risks. The enemy snake is at (4,6). They might be moving towards apples as well. But they are far away. So immediate danger is low.\n\nSo the options are UP or LEFT. Which one is better?\n\nIf I move UP to (9,4), then next move could be LEFT to (8,4), then continue left. That path might lead towards the apple at (3,9) but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving LEFT now to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then left again. Either way, the path is similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. So moving left from (9,3) to x=3 would take 6 steps left (from 9 to 3), and moving up from y=3 to 9 would take 6 steps up. So that's a long path. The apple at (2,4) is x=2, y=4. So moving left 7 steps and up 1 step. That's a longer left move but less up.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is x=0, y=7. So moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's even further.\n\nSo perhaps the closest apple is (2,4). Let's check the distance. From (9,3) to (2,4): Manhattan distance is (9-2)+(4-3)=7+1=8. To (3,9): (9-3)+(9-3)=6+6=12. To (0,7): 9+4=13. So (2,4) is the closest.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (2,4). To get there, I need to move left and up. So from (9,3), moving LEFT to (8,3) is a step in that direction. Then next steps would continue left and maybe up. Alternatively, moving UP first to (9,4), then left. But moving UP first might not be as efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now starts the journey towards (2,4). Let's see: if I move LEFT to (8,3), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. But to reach (2,4), I need to eventually move up once. So perhaps moving LEFT now is better.\n\nBut wait, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) would be moving towards (2,4) as well. The Manhattan distance from (9,4) to (2,4) is 7 in x-direction, same as from (8,3) to (2,4) which is 6 in x and 1 in y. So both are similar. But moving LEFT first reduces the x distance more quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards the same apple. But since they are at (4,6), they might be heading towards (2,4) as well. So perhaps moving towards (2,4) could lead to a collision. But given that the enemy is at (4,6), they are closer to (2,4) than I am. So maybe that's not the best target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. But that's further away. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go LEFT to (8,3) to start moving towards the center, which gives more options. Then, from there, I can decide to go UP or continue LEFT based on the next board state.\n\nBut since the current move needs to be decided now, between UP and LEFT.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move UP to (9,4), then next turn I can move LEFT to (8,4), which is a step towards (2,4). But moving UP now doesn't collect any apple. Moving LEFT now also doesn't collect an apple, but starts the journey towards (2,4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple I can reach in fewer steps. Let me check the apples again. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). From (9,3), the closest is (2,4) as discussed. The next closest is (3,9) which is 6 left and 6 up. So moving towards (2,4) is better.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT towards (2,4). So the next move should be LEFT to (8,3). That's safe, no collision. Then, next turn, move LEFT again to (7,3), and so on. But need to check if that's the best path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) might also be a path. But which is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I go LEFT now: (9,3) \u2192 (8,3). Next move could be LEFT to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. To reach (2,4), I need to go up once. So after moving left 7 times to (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 8 moves.\n\nIf I go UP now: (9,3) \u2192 (9,4). Then LEFT to (8,4), then left to (7,4), etc. To reach (2,4), need to go left 7 times from (9,4) to (2,4). That's 7 moves left. So total 8 moves (1 up +7 left). Same as the other path.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving LEFT first starts reducing the x-coordinate immediately, which might be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple that becomes reachable along the way. For example, if I move left to (8,3), then up to (8,4), which is closer to (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is moving towards (2,4) as well. If they are at (4,6), moving down and left could reach (2,4) in a few steps. So perhaps that apple is risky. Maybe I should target a different apple.\n\nLooking at (3,9), which is at x=3, y=9. From (9,3), moving left to x=3 (6 steps) and up to y=9 (6 steps). That's a longer path, but maybe safer if the enemy isn't heading there.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. From (9,3), moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's a long way, but maybe possible.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (4,6), they might be closer to (0,7) as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (2,4), even if there's a risk. Because otherwise, the enemy might get it first, and I need to collect points.\n\nSo, given that, moving LEFT now to (8,3) is a step towards (2,4). That seems reasonable.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT to (8,3), the body will be at (9,3) and (9,2). Wait, no. Wait, the current body is [(9,2)], and the head is at (9,3). So when I move LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)]. Wait, no. When the snake moves, the tail follows. Since the snake's body is only [(9,2)] and the head is at (9,3), moving the head to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3), (9,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2 (head at (9,3), body at (9,2)), then moving LEFT to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) would move to (9,3) if the snake didn't eat an apple. Wait, but the snake only grows when it eats an apple. So in this case, moving to (8,3) does not eat an apple, so the snake's length remains 2. So the new head is (8,3), and the body is [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the head moves, each body segment moves into the previous position. So if the snake is [ (9,3) (head), (9,2) (body) ], then moving LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [ (9,3) ], and the tail (9,2) is removed. So the snake's length remains 2. So after moving LEFT, the snake is at (8,3) with body at [(9,3)]. So the next move, if I move LEFT again, the body would be [(8,3), (9,3)], etc.\n\nBut in this case, moving LEFT to (8,3) is safe. No collision with self or others. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) is also safe. But no apple there. So which is better? Moving towards the apple or exploring.\n\nSince the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the nearest one is better. So LEFT is better.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with no body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board, my head is at (8,3). Possible moves are UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3), or RIGHT to (9,3). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (9,3)**: That's where my body is. Moving there would collide with myself, so that's a no-go.\n- **DOWN (8,2)**: Is there any obstacle? The board shows no snakes there. It's safe, but moving down might not be the best path towards an apple.\n- **LEFT (7,3)**: Safe, no obstacles. Moving left continues the path towards the apple at (2,4) or (0,7).\n- **UP (8,4)**: Also safe. Moving up could help approach the apple at (3,9) or (2,4) if I turn left later.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). From (8,3), moving LEFT to (7,3) gets me closer to (2,4). Moving UP to (8,4) starts heading towards (3,9). \n\nConsidering the enemy snake at (3,6), they might be moving towards (2,4) as well. If I go left, I risk a potential collision if they reach there first. However, moving up towards (3,9) might be safer since the enemy is further away from that apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now keeps me on a direct path to (2,4), which is closer. But I need to ensure the enemy isn't blocking that path. Since the enemy is at (3,6), they could move down-left towards (2,4) in a few moves. \n\nAnother consideration: moving UP to (8,4) allows more flexibility. From there, I can go left towards (7,4) and then down to (7,3) if needed, but that might take longer. \n\nGiven the immediate options, moving LEFT to (7,3) continues the path towards the nearest apple (2,4) and avoids potential conflicts with the enemy's current position. It's a safer bet to collect the apple quickly before the enemy does.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's check the positions. The closest apples might be (2,4) and (0,7). Wait, (2,4) is two steps left and two up from my current position (7,2). To get there, I need to move left and up. But let's calculate the distance. From (7,2) to (2,4): the x difference is 5 left, y difference is 2 up. So Manhattan distance is 7. Hmm. Alternatively, (0,7) is 7 left and 5 up. That's even further. The apple at (9,3) is to the right and up. From (7,2), moving right two and up one. That's a Manhattan distance of 3. That's closer. Oh, right, (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. So from (7,2), moving right twice and up once. So that's a shorter path. But wait, moving right would take me towards (9,3). Let me check the path. If I go right to (8,2), then right again to (9,2), then up to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, maybe I can go up first. If I go up to (7,3), then right twice to (9,3). That's also three moves. Either way. But maybe the enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my immediate path. So maybe the apple at (9,3) is the best target. Also, the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (7,2), moving down two and right two. But that's a longer path. So (9,3) seems the closest.\n\nWait, but the snake is at (7,2). Let me check possible directions. The possible moves are UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2). Which direction gets me closer to (9,3). If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (7,3), then RIGHT twice. Also three moves. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a straight path. Also, moving right now would take me towards the apple. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. Let's check the next steps. If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (9,2). Then UP to (9,3) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP now, then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. Wait, no. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. So total of three moves as well. Hmm. So either path is the same length. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a direct approach. Also, if I go right now, I can get closer to the apple. Let me check if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my path. The other apples are further away. So moving towards (9,3) seems the best option. So the first move should be RIGHT. Wait, but what about the apple at (3,9)? That's at the top middle. From (7,2), that's left 4 and up 7. That's a longer path. So not worth it right now. The apple at (0,7) is even further. So (9,3) is the closest. So direction RIGHT. But wait, what if I go UP first? Let's see. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go RIGHT twice and then UP once. Either way. But maybe moving right first is better. Because if I go right now, then next move right again, then up. But after moving right to (8,2), the next move to (9,2) is possible. Then up to (9,3). So that's three steps. Alternatively, if I go up first, then right twice. Both paths are safe. So which is better? Maybe the path that allows me to collect other apples next. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. So moving right first. So direction RIGHT. But wait, the apple at (9,0) is also in the same column. But that's down. From (7,2), moving down to (7,1) then right to (8,1), etc. But that's a longer path. So not worth it. So the best move is RIGHT towards (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But let me check if moving right is safe. The next position would be (8,2). Is there any snake there? The enemy snake is at (6,7), so no. The body is empty. So (8,2) is safe. Then moving right again to (9,2). Then up to (9,3). All safe. So yes. So the first move should be RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me think again. If I go UP first, then I can reach (7,3), then right twice. But maybe that's the same. So either direction is okay. But perhaps moving right first is better because it's a straight line towards the apple. So I'll choose RIGHT. The next move would be RIGHT again, then UP. So the first move is RIGHT. That's the direction to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body.\n\nSo, my current position is (8,2). The closest apple is (9,3), which is one step right and one up from here. If I move right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3). Either way, two moves. But since I'm at (8,2), moving right to (9,2) would get me closer. Then next turn, I can go up to eat the apple. But wait, moving right now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge of the board. Then next move up to (9,3) is safe. But I need to make sure there's no collision. The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) would also be a step towards the apple. Then right to (9,3). That's also two moves. Which path is better? Both are the same distance, but moving right first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple's x-coordinate. Also, after eating the apple at (9,3), I can consider other apples. \n\nWait, but if I move right to (9,2), then next move up to (9,3) to get the apple. That would grow my body. Then I need to avoid running into myself. But since my body is currently empty, after eating the apple, my body would be at (9,3), but the next move would be to leave that spot. So no immediate danger. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples nearby after getting (9,3)? The next closest might be (3,9) or (0,7). But those are further. Alternatively, after (9,3), maybe (9,0) is another apple in the same column. But that's down from (9,3) to (9,0), which is three steps down. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,3), maybe head towards (3,9) which is at the top. But that's a long way. So perhaps after getting (9,3), the next move would be to plan for another apple. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. \n\nSo the best move now is RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But wait, moving right from (8,2) to (9,2) is valid. No snakes or walls there. So that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP now to (8,3), then next move right to (9,3). That's one step less. Wait, no. From (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then right to (9,3) would take two moves. Same as moving right then up. So both paths take two moves. But moving right first allows me to be on the same x as the apple, which might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be better in case there's a risk of the enemy snake approaching. But the enemy is at (5,7), which is not near. So either direction is safe. \n\nHmm. So the decision is between RIGHT or UP. Which is better? Let's think about possible next steps. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move UP to (9,3). Then after eating the apple, I can go left to (8,3) or down to (9,2) (but that's my previous position, which is safe since my body hasn't grown yet). Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after eating the apple at (9,3), my body would be at (9,3), and the next move would extend. So if I go right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) (eating the apple), then the next move would be to move in a direction that doesn't hit myself. For example, if I go left to (8,3), that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3) (eating the apple), then next move could be up to (9,4) or right (but right is a wall). So up would be better. \n\nBut both paths are valid. However, moving right first might be better because it positions me closer to the edge, which could be a risk if I can't turn, but in this case, after moving right to (9,2), I can still go up. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer in case there's an unexpected obstacle. But given the current board, both are safe. \n\nSince both options are equally good, but the apple is at (9,3), moving right now would take me closer in x-coordinate. So I'll choose RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT, which took me from (7,2) to (8,2). Now, moving RIGHT again to (9,2) is possible. Then next move UP to (9,3). That's the plan. So the direction is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (9,3) with the body part at (9,2). The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). Wait, the board state shows an apple at (9,9) as well? Wait, the user listed apples at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). But in the board diagram, there's an A at (9,9) in row 9, which is (3,9) maybe? Let me check again.\n\nThe board state shows row 9 as \". . . A . . . . . .\", which would be x=3, y=9. So that's (3,9), which is one of the listed apples. The other apples are at (0,7) (row 7, x=0), (9,0) (row 0, x=9), (2,4) (row 4, x=2), (1,1) (row 1, x=1). So the available apples are those positions.\n\nMy snake is at (9,3) with body at [(9,2)]. So the head is at (9,3), and the tail is at (9,2). So the snake is moving upwards, since the body is behind it. Wait, the last move was UP, which moved the head from (9,2) to (9,3) in the previous step. Now, the current position is head at (9,3), body at (9,2). So the snake is facing UP, because moving from (9,2) to (9,3) was UP. So the next move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (4,6) with body at []. So their head is at (4,6), no body. So they're just a single segment. They might be moving towards apples as well.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples without dying. Let's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent head at (9,3). Possible directions:\n\nUP: to (9,4). Is that within the grid? Yes, since y ranges from 0 to 9. So (9,4) is valid. Are there any apples there? Looking at the apples list, no. So moving UP would not collect an apple. But maybe there's an apple nearby. Wait, the apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest apple to (9,3) is (9,0) but that's far down. The next closest might be (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. But that's quite a distance. Alternatively, (1,1) is at the bottom left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,9) but according to the list, that's (3,9). Wait, the user's listed apples include (3,9), which is x=3, y=9. So that's in the top middle. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=3 would take a while. \n\nSo the immediate options are to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nUP: (9,4). Is that safe? No enemies there. Also, my own body is at (9,2) and (9,3) is the head. So moving to (9,4) would not collide with myself. So that's safe.\n\nDOWN: (9,2). That's where the body is. So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. That's a death. So can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (8,3). Is that safe? Let's check. Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (4,6), which is far away. So (8,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (10,3) which is outside the grid. So that's a wall. Can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple? Let's see. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest ones are (9,0) which is way down, but moving down would require going through (9,2) which is the body. So that's not possible. The other apples are (3,9) which is up and to the left. So moving UP would take me to (9,4), then maybe continue left towards (8,4), etc., but that's a long path. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (8,3) and then proceeding left towards (7,3), etc., but that's not directly towards any apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. So to reach that, I need to move left from (9,3) towards x=3, but y needs to go up to 9. So moving left and up. Alternatively, the apple at (2,4) is at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left to x=2 and up to y=4. That's a possible path. But that's 7 steps left and 1 up. So maybe moving left towards that direction.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is at x=1, y=1. That's down and left. But moving down would hit the body. So not possible.\n\nThe apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. That's up and left. From (9,3), moving left and up. So perhaps moving left towards (8,3), then (7,3), etc., while moving up towards y=7.\n\nBut which direction now gives the best path towards an apple without getting stuck?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,0) which is at the bottom right. But to get there, I need to move down from (9,3) to (9,2), which is my body. So that's impossible. So that apple is not reachable unless I can loop around, but with the current body, moving down is blocked.\n\nSo the available apples are (3,9), (2,4), (0,7), (1,1). The closest is (2,4) at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=2 and up to y=4. So moving left (to x=8, then 7, etc.) and up (to y=4). So the first step could be LEFT to (8,3), then next steps continue left and up.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nWhich path is safer? Let's consider possible risks. The enemy snake is at (4,6). They might be moving towards apples as well. But they are far away. So immediate danger is low.\n\nSo the options are UP or LEFT. Which one is better?\n\nIf I move UP to (9,4), then next move could be LEFT to (8,4), then continue left. That path might lead towards the apple at (3,9) but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving LEFT now to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then left again. Either way, the path is similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. So moving left from (9,3) to x=3 would take 6 steps left (from 9 to 3), and moving up from y=3 to 9 would take 6 steps up. So that's a long path. The apple at (2,4) is x=2, y=4. So moving left 7 steps and up 1 step. That's a longer left move but less up.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is x=0, y=7. So moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's even further.\n\nSo perhaps the closest apple is (2,4). Let's check the distance. From (9,3) to (2,4): Manhattan distance is (9-2)+(4-3)=7+1=8. To (3,9): (9-3)+(9-3)=6+6=12. To (0,7): 9+4=13. So (2,4) is the closest.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (2,4). To get there, I need to move left and up. So from (9,3), moving LEFT to (8,3) is a step in that direction. Then next steps would continue left and maybe up. Alternatively, moving UP first to (9,4), then left. But moving UP first might not be as efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now starts the journey towards (2,4). Let's see: if I move LEFT to (8,3), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. But to reach (2,4), I need to eventually move up once. So perhaps moving LEFT now is better.\n\nBut wait, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) would be moving towards (2,4) as well. The Manhattan distance from (9,4) to (2,4) is 7 in x-direction, same as from (8,3) to (2,4) which is 6 in x and 1 in y. So both are similar. But moving LEFT first reduces the x distance more quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards the same apple. But since they are at (4,6), they might be heading towards (2,4) as well. So perhaps moving towards (2,4) could lead to a collision. But given that the enemy is at (4,6), they are closer to (2,4) than I am. So maybe that's not the best target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. But that's further away. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go LEFT to (8,3) to start moving towards the center, which gives more options. Then, from there, I can decide to go UP or continue LEFT based on the next board state.\n\nBut since the current move needs to be decided now, between UP and LEFT.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move UP to (9,4), then next turn I can move LEFT to (8,4), which is a step towards (2,4). But moving UP now doesn't collect any apple. Moving LEFT now also doesn't collect an apple, but starts the journey towards (2,4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple I can reach in fewer steps. Let me check the apples again. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). From (9,3), the closest is (2,4) as discussed. The next closest is (3,9) which is 6 left and 6 up. So moving towards (2,4) is better.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT towards (2,4). So the next move should be LEFT to (8,3). That's safe, no collision. Then, next turn, move LEFT again to (7,3), and so on. But need to check if that's the best path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) might also be a path. But which is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I go LEFT now: (9,3) \u2192 (8,3). Next move could be LEFT to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. To reach (2,4), I need to go up once. So after moving left 7 times to (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 8 moves.\n\nIf I go UP now: (9,3) \u2192 (9,4). Then LEFT to (8,4), then left to (7,4), etc. To reach (2,4), need to go left 7 times from (9,4) to (2,4). That's 7 moves left. So total 8 moves (1 up +7 left). Same as the other path.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving LEFT first starts reducing the x-coordinate immediately, which might be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple that becomes reachable along the way. For example, if I move left to (8,3), then up to (8,4), which is closer to (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is moving towards (2,4) as well. If they are at (4,6), moving down and left could reach (2,4) in a few steps. So perhaps that apple is risky. Maybe I should target a different apple.\n\nLooking at (3,9), which is at x=3, y=9. From (9,3), moving left to x=3 (6 steps) and up to y=9 (6 steps). That's a longer path, but maybe safer if the enemy isn't heading there.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. From (9,3), moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's a long way, but maybe possible.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (4,6), they might be closer to (0,7) as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (2,4), even if there's a risk. Because otherwise, the enemy might get it first, and I need to collect points.\n\nSo, given that, moving LEFT now to (8,3) is a step towards (2,4). That seems reasonable.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT to (8,3), the body will be at (9,3) and (9,2). Wait, no. Wait, the current body is [(9,2)], and the head is at (9,3). So when I move LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)]. Wait, no. When the snake moves, the tail follows. Since the snake's body is only [(9,2)] and the head is at (9,3), moving the head to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3), (9,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2 (head at (9,3), body at (9,2)), then moving LEFT to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) would move to (9,3) if the snake didn't eat an apple. Wait, but the snake only grows when it eats an apple. So in this case, moving to (8,3) does not eat an apple, so the snake's length remains 2. So the new head is (8,3), and the body is [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the head moves, each body segment moves into the previous position. So if the snake is [ (9,3) (head), (9,2) (body) ], then moving LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [ (9,3) ], and the tail (9,2) is removed. So the snake's length remains 2. So after moving LEFT, the snake is at (8,3) with body at [(9,3)]. So the next move, if I move LEFT again, the body would be [(8,3), (9,3)], etc.\n\nBut in this case, moving LEFT to (8,3) is safe. No collision with self or others. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) is also safe. But no apple there. So which is better? Moving towards the apple or exploring.\n\nSince the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the nearest one is better. So LEFT is better.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Moving there would collide with myself, so that's a no-go.\n- **DOWN (8,2)**: Is there any obstacle? The board shows no snakes there. It's safe, but moving down might not be the best path towards an apple.\n- **LEFT (7,3)**: Safe, no obstacles.

The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with no body.\n\nPossible moves from (7,3) are UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), or RIGHT to (8,3). Wait, but the body is at (8,3), so moving RIGHT would hit my own body. So RIGHT is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's check the path. From (7,3), moving LEFT towards (6,3) would get me closer to (2,4). Moving UP to (7,4) could head towards (3,9). Moving DOWN to (7,2) might not be near any apples immediately.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6). If I go towards (2,4), the enemy might be moving towards that apple too. But since they're at (2,6), they could move down to (2,5) then (2,4). But maybe I can reach it first if I move left now.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (3,9) might be safer. From (7,3), moving UP to (7,4), then LEFT towards (6,4), (5,4), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top right. To get there, I need to go up and left. But maybe that's a longer route.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,0) in the bottom right. But that's far from my current position. The apple at (1,1) is also possible, but again, far.\n\nSo the nearest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's calculate the distance. From (7,3) to (2,4): that's 5 units left and 1 up. Total of 6 moves. To (3,9): 4 left and 6 up. So (2,4) is closer.\n\nIf I move LEFT now to (6,3), that's one step closer. Then continue left towards (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 5 moves. But the enemy is at (2,6). They might reach (2,4) in two moves: (2,5), (2,4). So if I take 5 moves, they could get there first. Hmm, maybe not the best plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. From (7,3), moving UP to (7,4), then left to (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), then up to (3,5), (3,6)... Wait, the enemy is at (2,6). So moving up to (3,9) might not conflict with them. But that's a longer path. However, if I can get there without competition, it's worth it.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left to (6,3), then up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), then left to (5,7), etc. That's a longer path. Maybe not the best.\n\nSo between (2,4) and (3,9), which is better? (2,4) is closer but riskier due to the enemy. (3,9) is further but maybe safer.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (2,6). If they move towards (2,4), they can get there in two moves. But maybe they are going elsewhere. Since they have no body, they might be heading for apples too. If they go down to (2,5), then (2,4), but maybe they are going towards (3,9) as well. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,1). From (7,3), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down to (7,2), then right to (8,2), (9,2), then down to (9,1), (9,0). But that's 4 moves. But the enemy might not be going there. However, that's a possible path.\n\nBut considering the current position, the closest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's think again. If I move LEFT to (6,3), that's one step closer to (2,4). Then next move, I can go LEFT again to (5,3), etc. But the enemy might reach (2,4) first. Alternatively, if I move UP to (7,4), then next move LEFT to (6,4), then up towards (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (2,4). Maybe they are going for (3,9) as well. But their position is (2,6). To reach (3,9), they need to move right and up. So maybe they are heading that way. If I go for (3,9), I might have competition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go LEFT towards (2,4) and try to get there before the enemy. If I can reach it in 5 moves, and the enemy in 2, then I can't. But maybe the enemy isn't moving directly towards it. Since their last move isn't known, perhaps they are moving in another direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move UP to (7,4) to start heading towards (3,9). That way, I can avoid potential conflict with the enemy. Let's see: from (7,4), next move could be LEFT to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), etc. That's a longer path but maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) might not be useful unless there's an apple there. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best.\n\nSo between LEFT and UP. If I go LEFT, I'm moving towards (2,4) but risk the enemy. If I go UP, I'm moving towards (3,9) but it's a longer path. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple. The apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is in the bottom left. From (7,3), moving left and down. But again, long path.\n\nHmm. The enemy is at (2,6). If they move down to (2,5), then (2,4), they can reach the apple in two moves. If I move left now, I can reach (2,4) in 5 moves. So the enemy would get there first. So maybe that's not a good idea.\n\nTherefore, perhaps moving UP towards (3,9) is better. Let's calculate the steps. From (7,3) to (3,9): need to move left 4 and up 6. So 10 moves. But that's a long way. But maybe the enemy isn't going there. If the enemy is at (2,6), they can reach (3,9) in 3 moves (right to 3,6; up to 3,7; up to 3,8; up to 3,9). So 3 moves. But I need 10 moves, which is way longer. So they would get there first. So that's not good either.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to consider other apples. The apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down to (7,2), then right to (8,2), (9,2), then down to (9,1), (9,0). That's 4 moves. But is that possible? Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (7,3). Move DOWN to (7,2). Then RIGHT to (8,2). Then RIGHT to (9,2). Then DOWN to (9,1). Then DOWN to (9,0). That's 5 moves. But the enemy might not be going there. If I can reach that apple in 5 moves, that's possible. But is there any obstacle? The board shows no snakes in that area. The enemy is at (2,6), so they are far away. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nBut why didn't I consider that earlier? Because the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down and right. Let's check the path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. Then RIGHT to (8,2), (9,2). Then down to (9,1), (9,0). That's a possible path. But is there any snake in that area? The board shows snake #1 at (2,6), and my snake at (7,3) and (8,3). So the path to (9,0) seems clear.\n\nSo maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) is a good start towards (9,0). But is that the best option? Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: LEFT towards (2,4) - risky due to enemy.\n\nOption 2: UP towards (3,9) - enemy can reach faster.\n\nOption 3: DOWN towards (9,0) - longer path but safer.\n\nOption 4: Other apples.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is also possible. From (7,3), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left and up. But again, long path.\n\nSo the apple at (9,0) seems reachable in 5 moves. Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (7,3). Move DOWN to (7,2). Then RIGHT to (8,2). Then RIGHT to (9,2). Then DOWN to (9,1). Then DOWN to (9,0). That's 5 moves. Each step is safe as long as no other snakes block the way. Since the enemy is at (2,6), they are far away. So this path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, after moving DOWN to (7,2), next move could be DOWN again to (7,1), then RIGHT to (8,1), (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's also 5 moves. Either path works.\n\nSo moving DOWN now starts that journey. But is there any immediate danger? Moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. The current position is (7,3), body at (8,3). So moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. No snakes or walls there.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (6,3) is also safe. But which path leads to an apple faster?\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,2), then towards (9,0), that's 5 moves. If I go LEFT to (6,3), then towards (2,4), that's 5 moves. But the enemy might reach (2,4) first. So perhaps the (9,0) apple is safer.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right corner. The snake's current position is (7,3). Moving down and right would get there. But the enemy is at (2,6), which is far away. So that's a good target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is still an option. But the enemy can reach it faster. So perhaps not.\n\nSo the best options are either (2,4) or (9,0). Since (9,0) is further but safer, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nBut let's think again. If I move LEFT now to (6,3), then next move LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT to (4,3), etc., towards (2,4). But the enemy is at (2,6). They could move down to (2,5), then (2,4). So they can reach it in two moves. So even if I start moving left, they can get there first. So that's not good.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (9,0) is better. So the first step would be DOWN to (7,2). Then proceed right and down.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT is not possible because the body is at (8,3). So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nSo the best move now is DOWN to (7,2) to start heading towards (9,0). That seems safer and less contested.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's check the positions. The closest apples might be (2,4) and (0,7). Wait, (2,4) is two steps left and two up from my current position (7,2). To get there, I need to move left and up. But let's calculate the distance. From (7,2) to (2,4): the x difference is 5 left, y difference is 2 up. So Manhattan distance is 7. Hmm. Alternatively, (0,7) is 7 left and 5 up. That's even further. The apple at (9,3) is to the right and up. From (7,2), moving right two and up one. That's a Manhattan distance of 3. That's closer. Oh, right, (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. So from (7,2), moving right twice and up once. So that's a shorter path. But wait, moving right would take me towards (9,3). Let me check the path. If I go right to (8,2), then right again to (9,2), then up to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, maybe I can go up first. If I go up to (7,3), then right twice to (9,3). That's also three moves. Either way. But maybe the enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my immediate path. So maybe the apple at (9,3) is the best target. Also, the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (7,2), moving down two and right two. But that's a longer path. So (9,3) seems the closest.\n\nWait, but the snake is at (7,2). Let me check possible directions. The possible moves are UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2). Which direction gets me closer to (9,3). If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (7,3), then RIGHT twice. Also three moves. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a straight path. Also, moving right now would take me towards the apple. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. Let's check the next steps. If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (9,2). Then UP to (9,3) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP now, then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. Wait, no. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. So total of three moves as well. Hmm. So either path is the same length. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a direct approach. Also, if I go right now, I can get closer to the apple. Let me check if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my path. The other apples are further away. So moving towards (9,3) seems the best option. So the first move should be RIGHT. Wait, but what about the apple at (3,9)? That's at the top middle. From (7,2), that's left 4 and up 7. That's a longer path. So not worth it right now. The apple at (0,7) is even further. So (9,3) is the closest. So direction RIGHT. But wait, what if I go UP first? Let's see. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go RIGHT twice and then UP once. Either way. But maybe moving right first is better. Because if I go right now, then next move right again, then up. But after moving right to (8,2), the next move to (9,2) is possible. Then up to (9,3). So that's three steps. Alternatively, if I go up first, then right twice. Both paths are safe. So which is better? Maybe the path that allows me to collect other apples next. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. So moving right first. So direction RIGHT. But wait, the apple at (9,0) is also in the same column. But that's down. From (7,2), moving down to (7,1) then right to (8,1), etc. But that's a longer path. So not worth it. So the best move is RIGHT towards (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But let me check if moving right is safe. The next position would be (8,2). Is there any snake there? The enemy snake is at (6,7), so no. The body is empty. So (8,2) is safe. Then moving right again to (9,2). Then up to (9,3). All safe. So yes. So the first move should be RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me think again. If I go UP first, then I can reach (7,3), then right twice. But maybe that's the same. So either direction is okay. But perhaps moving right first is better because it's a straight line towards the apple. So I'll choose RIGHT. The next move would be RIGHT again, then UP. So the first move is RIGHT. That's the direction to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

I'm currently at (6, 7), and the apples are located at:\n\n- (9, 3)\n- (0, 7)\n- (9, 0)\n- (2, 4)\n- (3, 9)\n\nBased on this layout, my next possible moves and their consequences are as follows:\n\n1. **UP (to 6, 8)**:\n   - This move does not lead to an apple and keeps me in a safe zone; however, it doesn't gain me any points.\n\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 6)**:\n   - This also doesn't lead to an apple and does not put me in danger.\n\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 7)**:\n   - Again, no apple. But I remain safe and potentially set up future moves towards apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 7)**:\n   - This does not gain any points but remains safe.\n\nTo maximize my efficiency regarding future turns, my aim should be to analyze options that could lead to apples while ensuring I do not run into walls or enemy snakes. There are no immediate threats from enemy snakes nearby, allowing me to make decisions based on gaining points.\n\nThe apples at (9, 0), (0, 7), (2, 4), and (3, 9) still seem a bit far to grab immediately. However, I could actually move to (5, 7) (LEFT), potentially allowing a route toward (0, 7) or deciding future moves toward (2, 4).\n\nSince (0, 7) is directly above me at (0, 6), and that is the closest apple to me right now, moving LEFT to (5, 7) seems the most strategic option as it positions me closer to apples while not encountering any threats. It opens future paths toward (0, 7).\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (8,2) after moving right last time. The apples are still at (9,3), (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body.\n\nSo, my current position is (8,2). The closest apple is (9,3), which is one step right and one up from here. If I move right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3). Either way, two moves. But since I'm at (8,2), moving right to (9,2) would get me closer. Then next turn, I can go up to eat the apple. But wait, moving right now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge of the board. Then next move up to (9,3) is safe. But I need to make sure there's no collision. The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) would also be a step towards the apple. Then right to (9,3). That's also two moves. Which path is better? Both are the same distance, but moving right first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple's x-coordinate. Also, after eating the apple at (9,3), I can consider other apples. \n\nWait, but if I move right to (9,2), then next move up to (9,3) to get the apple. That would grow my body. Then I need to avoid running into myself. But since my body is currently empty, after eating the apple, my body would be at (9,3), but the next move would be to leave that spot. So no immediate danger. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples nearby after getting (9,3)? The next closest might be (3,9) or (0,7). But those are further. Alternatively, after (9,3), maybe (9,0) is another apple in the same column. But that's down from (9,3) to (9,0), which is three steps down. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,3), maybe head towards (3,9) which is at the top. But that's a long way. So perhaps after getting (9,3), the next move would be to plan for another apple. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. \n\nSo the best move now is RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But wait, moving right from (8,2) to (9,2) is valid. No snakes or walls there. So that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP now to (8,3), then next move right to (9,3). That's one step less. Wait, no. From (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then right to (9,3) would take two moves. Same as moving right then up. So both paths take two moves. But moving right first allows me to be on the same x as the apple, which might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be better in case there's a risk of the enemy snake approaching. But the enemy is at (5,7), which is not near. So either direction is safe. \n\nHmm. So the decision is between RIGHT or UP. Which is better? Let's think about possible next steps. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move UP to (9,3). Then after eating the apple, I can go left to (8,3) or down to (9,2) (but that's my previous position, which is safe since my body hasn't grown yet). Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after eating the apple at (9,3), my body would be at (9,3), and the next move would extend. So if I go right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) (eating the apple), then the next move would be to move in a direction that doesn't hit myself. For example, if I go left to (8,3), that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3) (eating the apple), then next move could be up to (9,4) or right (but right is a wall). So up would be better. \n\nBut both paths are valid. However, moving right first might be better because it positions me closer to the edge, which could be a risk if I can't turn, but in this case, after moving right to (9,2), I can still go up. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer in case there's an unexpected obstacle. But given the current board, both are safe. \n\nSince both options are equally good, but the apple is at (9,3), moving right now would take me closer in x-coordinate. So I'll choose RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT, which took me from (7,2) to (8,2). Now, moving RIGHT again to (9,2) is possible. Then next move UP to (9,3). That's the plan. So the direction is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

However, since the body is empty now, after eating, the tail will be at (9,3), so moving away from there is necessary. But for this turn, UP is the optimal direction to secure the apple. \n\nAlternative directions: If I go LEFT to (8,2), that's moving away from the apple. DOWN to (9,1) also moves away. RIGHT is out of bounds. So UP is the only viable option to reach the nearest apple safely.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (9,3) with the body part at (9,2). The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). Wait, the board state shows an apple at (9,9) as well? Wait, the user listed apples at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). But in the board diagram, there's an A at (9,9) in row 9, which is (3,9) maybe? Let me check again.\n\nThe board state shows row 9 as \". . . A . . . . . .\", which would be x=3, y=9. So that's (3,9), which is one of the listed apples. The other apples are at (0,7) (row 7, x=0), (9,0) (row 0, x=9), (2,4) (row 4, x=2), (1,1) (row 1, x=1). So the available apples are those positions.\n\nMy snake is at (9,3) with body at [(9,2)]. So the head is at (9,3), and the tail is at (9,2). So the snake is moving upwards, since the body is behind it. Wait, the last move was UP, which moved the head from (9,2) to (9,3) in the previous step. Now, the current position is head at (9,3), body at (9,2). So the snake is facing UP, because moving from (9,2) to (9,3) was UP. So the next move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (4,6) with body at []. So their head is at (4,6), no body. So they're just a single segment. They might be moving towards apples as well.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples without dying. Let's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent head at (9,3). Possible directions:\n\nUP: to (9,4). Is that within the grid? Yes, since y ranges from 0 to 9. So (9,4) is valid. Are there any apples there? Looking at the apples list, no. So moving UP would not collect an apple. But maybe there's an apple nearby. Wait, the apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest apple to (9,3) is (9,0) but that's far down. The next closest might be (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. But that's quite a distance. Alternatively, (1,1) is at the bottom left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,9) but according to the list, that's (3,9). Wait, the user's listed apples include (3,9), which is x=3, y=9. So that's in the top middle. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=3 would take a while. \n\nSo the immediate options are to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nUP: (9,4). Is that safe? No enemies there. Also, my own body is at (9,2) and (9,3) is the head. So moving to (9,4) would not collide with myself. So that's safe.\n\nDOWN: (9,2). That's where the body is. So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. That's a death. So can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (8,3). Is that safe? Let's check. Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (4,6), which is far away. So (8,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (10,3) which is outside the grid. So that's a wall. Can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple? Let's see. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest ones are (9,0) which is way down, but moving down would require going through (9,2) which is the body. So that's not possible. The other apples are (3,9) which is up and to the left. So moving UP would take me to (9,4), then maybe continue left towards (8,4), etc., but that's a long path. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (8,3) and then proceeding left towards (7,3), etc., but that's not directly towards any apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. So to reach that, I need to move left from (9,3) towards x=3, but y needs to go up to 9. So moving left and up. Alternatively, the apple at (2,4) is at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left to x=2 and up to y=4. That's a possible path. But that's 7 steps left and 1 up. So maybe moving left towards that direction.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is at x=1, y=1. That's down and left. But moving down would hit the body. So not possible.\n\nThe apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. That's up and left. From (9,3), moving left and up. So perhaps moving left towards (8,3), then (7,3), etc., while moving up towards y=7.\n\nBut which direction now gives the best path towards an apple without getting stuck?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,0) which is at the bottom right. But to get there, I need to move down from (9,3) to (9,2), which is my body. So that's impossible. So that apple is not reachable unless I can loop around, but with the current body, moving down is blocked.\n\nSo the available apples are (3,9), (2,4), (0,7), (1,1). The closest is (2,4) at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=2 and up to y=4. So moving left (to x=8, then 7, etc.) and up (to y=4). So the first step could be LEFT to (8,3), then next steps continue left and up.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nWhich path is safer? Let's consider possible risks. The enemy snake is at (4,6). They might be moving towards apples as well. But they are far away. So immediate danger is low.\n\nSo the options are UP or LEFT. Which one is better?\n\nIf I move UP to (9,4), then next move could be LEFT to (8,4), then continue left. That path might lead towards the apple at (3,9) but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving LEFT now to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then left again. Either way, the path is similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. So moving left from (9,3) to x=3 would take 6 steps left (from 9 to 3), and moving up from y=3 to 9 would take 6 steps up. So that's a long path. The apple at (2,4) is x=2, y=4. So moving left 7 steps and up 1 step. That's a longer left move but less up.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is x=0, y=7. So moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's even further.\n\nSo perhaps the closest apple is (2,4). Let's check the distance. From (9,3) to (2,4): Manhattan distance is (9-2)+(4-3)=7+1=8. To (3,9): (9-3)+(9-3)=6+6=12. To (0,7): 9+4=13. So (2,4) is the closest.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (2,4). To get there, I need to move left and up. So from (9,3), moving LEFT to (8,3) is a step in that direction. Then next steps would continue left and maybe up. Alternatively, moving UP first to (9,4), then left. But moving UP first might not be as efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now starts the journey towards (2,4). Let's see: if I move LEFT to (8,3), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. But to reach (2,4), I need to eventually move up once. So perhaps moving LEFT now is better.\n\nBut wait, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) would be moving towards (2,4) as well. The Manhattan distance from (9,4) to (2,4) is 7 in x-direction, same as from (8,3) to (2,4) which is 6 in x and 1 in y. So both are similar. But moving LEFT first reduces the x distance more quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards the same apple. But since they are at (4,6), they might be heading towards (2,4) as well. So perhaps moving towards (2,4) could lead to a collision. But given that the enemy is at (4,6), they are closer to (2,4) than I am. So maybe that's not the best target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. But that's further away. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go LEFT to (8,3) to start moving towards the center, which gives more options. Then, from there, I can decide to go UP or continue LEFT based on the next board state.\n\nBut since the current move needs to be decided now, between UP and LEFT.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move UP to (9,4), then next turn I can move LEFT to (8,4), which is a step towards (2,4). But moving UP now doesn't collect any apple. Moving LEFT now also doesn't collect an apple, but starts the journey towards (2,4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple I can reach in fewer steps. Let me check the apples again. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). From (9,3), the closest is (2,4) as discussed. The next closest is (3,9) which is 6 left and 6 up. So moving towards (2,4) is better.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT towards (2,4). So the next move should be LEFT to (8,3). That's safe, no collision. Then, next turn, move LEFT again to (7,3), and so on. But need to check if that's the best path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) might also be a path. But which is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I go LEFT now: (9,3) \u2192 (8,3). Next move could be LEFT to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. To reach (2,4), I need to go up once. So after moving left 7 times to (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 8 moves.\n\nIf I go UP now: (9,3) \u2192 (9,4). Then LEFT to (8,4), then left to (7,4), etc. To reach (2,4), need to go left 7 times from (9,4) to (2,4). That's 7 moves left. So total 8 moves (1 up +7 left). Same as the other path.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving LEFT first starts reducing the x-coordinate immediately, which might be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple that becomes reachable along the way. For example, if I move left to (8,3), then up to (8,4), which is closer to (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is moving towards (2,4) as well. If they are at (4,6), moving down and left could reach (2,4) in a few steps. So perhaps that apple is risky. Maybe I should target a different apple.\n\nLooking at (3,9), which is at x=3, y=9. From (9,3), moving left to x=3 (6 steps) and up to y=9 (6 steps). That's a longer path, but maybe safer if the enemy isn't heading there.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. From (9,3), moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's a long way, but maybe possible.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (4,6), they might be closer to (0,7) as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (2,4), even if there's a risk. Because otherwise, the enemy might get it first, and I need to collect points.\n\nSo, given that, moving LEFT now to (8,3) is a step towards (2,4). That seems reasonable.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT to (8,3), the body will be at (9,3) and (9,2). Wait, no. Wait, the current body is [(9,2)], and the head is at (9,3). So when I move LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)]. Wait, no. When the snake moves, the tail follows. Since the snake's body is only [(9,2)] and the head is at (9,3), moving the head to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3), (9,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2 (head at (9,3), body at (9,2)), then moving LEFT to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) would move to (9,3) if the snake didn't eat an apple. Wait, but the snake only grows when it eats an apple. So in this case, moving to (8,3) does not eat an apple, so the snake's length remains 2. So the new head is (8,3), and the body is [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the head moves, each body segment moves into the previous position. So if the snake is [ (9,3) (head), (9,2) (body) ], then moving LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [ (9,3) ], and the tail (9,2) is removed. So the snake's length remains 2. So after moving LEFT, the snake is at (8,3) with body at [(9,3)]. So the next move, if I move LEFT again, the body would be [(8,3), (9,3)], etc.\n\nBut in this case, moving LEFT to (8,3) is safe. No collision with self or others. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) is also safe. But no apple there. So which is better? Moving towards the apple or exploring.\n\nSince the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the nearest one is better. So LEFT is better.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Possible moves are UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3), or RIGHT to (9,3). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (9,3)**: That's where my body is. Moving there would collide with myself, so that's a no-go.\n- **DOWN (8,2)**: Is there any obstacle? The board shows no snakes there. It's safe, but moving down might not be the best path towards an apple.\n- **LEFT (7,3)**: Safe, no obstacles.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (7,3) with the body at (8,3). So the head is at (7,3), and the tail is at (8,3). The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with no body.\n\nPossible moves from (7,3) are UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), or RIGHT to (8,3). Wait, but the body is at (8,3), so moving RIGHT would hit my own body. So RIGHT is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's check the path. From (7,3), moving LEFT towards (6,3) would get me closer to (2,4). Moving UP to (7,4) could head towards (3,9). Moving DOWN to (7,2) might not be near any apples immediately.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6). If I go towards (2,4), the enemy might be moving towards that apple too. But since they're at (2,6), they could move down to (2,5) then (2,4). But maybe I can reach it first if I move left now.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (3,9) might be safer. From (7,3), moving UP to (7,4), then LEFT towards (6,4), (5,4), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top right. To get there, I need to go up and left. But maybe that's a longer route.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,0) in the bottom right. But that's far from my current position. The apple at (1,1) is also possible, but again, far.\n\nSo the nearest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's calculate the distance. From (7,3) to (2,4): that's 5 units left and 1 up. Total of 6 moves. To (3,9): 4 left and 6 up. So (2,4) is closer.\n\nIf I move LEFT now to (6,3), that's one step closer. Then continue left towards (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 5 moves. But the enemy is at (2,6). They might reach (2,4) in two moves: (2,5), (2,4). So if I take 5 moves, they could get there first. Hmm, maybe not the best plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. From (7,3), moving UP to (7,4), then left to (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), then up to (3,5), (3,6)... Wait, the enemy is at (2,6). So moving up to (3,9) might not conflict with them. But that's a longer path. However, if I can get there without competition, it's worth it.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left to (6,3), then up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), then left to (5,7), etc. That's a longer path. Maybe not the best.\n\nSo between (2,4) and (3,9), which is better? (2,4) is closer but riskier due to the enemy. (3,9) is further but maybe safer.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (2,6). If they move towards (2,4), they can get there in two moves. But maybe they are going elsewhere. Since they have no body, they might be heading for apples too. If they go down to (2,5), then (2,4), but maybe they are going towards (3,9) as well. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,1). From (7,3), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down to (7,2), then right to (8,2), (9,2), then down to (9,1), (9,0). But that's 4 moves. But the enemy might not be going there. However, that's a possible path.\n\nBut considering the current position, the closest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's think again. If I move LEFT to (6,3), that's one step closer to (2,4). Then next move, I can go LEFT again to (5,3), etc. But the enemy might reach (2,4) first. Alternatively, if I move UP to (7,4), then next move LEFT to (6,4), then up towards (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (2,4). Maybe they are going for (3,9) as well. But their position is (2,6). To reach (3,9), they need to move right and up. So maybe they are heading that way. If I go for (3,9), I might have competition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go LEFT towards (2,4) and try to get there before the enemy. If I can reach it in 5 moves, and the enemy in 2, then I can't. But maybe the enemy isn't moving directly towards it. Since their last move isn't known, perhaps they are moving in another direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move UP to (7,4) to start heading towards (3,9). That way, I can avoid potential conflict with the enemy. Let's see: from (7,4), next move could be LEFT to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), etc. That's a longer path but maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) might not be useful unless there's an apple there. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best.\n\nSo between LEFT and UP. If I go LEFT, I'm moving towards (2,4) but risk the enemy. If I go UP, I'm moving towards (3,9) but it's a longer path. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple. The apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is in the bottom left. From (7,3), moving left and down. But again, long path.\n\nHmm. The enemy is at (2,6). If they move down to (2,5), then (2,4), they can reach the apple in two moves. If I move left now, I can reach (2,4) in 5 moves. So the enemy would get there first. So maybe that's not a good idea.\n\nTherefore, perhaps moving UP towards (3,9) is better. Let's calculate the steps. From (7,3) to (3,9): need to move left 4 and up 6. So 10 moves. But that's a long way. But maybe the enemy isn't going there. If the enemy is at (2,6), they can reach (3,9) in 3 moves (right to 3,6; up to 3,7; up to 3,8; up to 3,9). So 3 moves. But I need 10 moves, which is way longer. So they would get there first. So that's not good either.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to consider other apples. The apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down to (7,2), then right to (8,2), (9,2), then down to (9,1), (9,0). That's 4 moves. But is that possible? Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (7,3). Move DOWN to (7,2). Then RIGHT to (8,2). Then RIGHT to (9,2). Then DOWN to (9,1). Then DOWN to (9,0). That's 5 moves. But the enemy might not be going there. If I can reach that apple in 5 moves, that's possible. But is there any obstacle? The board shows no snakes in that area. The enemy is at (2,6), so they are far away. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nBut why didn't I consider that earlier? Because the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down and right. Let's check the path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. Then RIGHT to (8,2), (9,2). Then down to (9,1), (9,0). That's a possible path. But is there any snake in that area? The board shows snake #1 at (2,6), and my snake at (7,3) and (8,3). So the path to (9,0) seems clear.\n\nSo maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) is a good start towards (9,0). But is that the best option? Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: LEFT towards (2,4) - risky due to enemy.\n\nOption 2: UP towards (3,9) - enemy can reach faster.\n\nOption 3: DOWN towards (9,0) - longer path but safer.\n\nOption 4: Other apples.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is also possible. From (7,3), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left and up. But again, long path.\n\nSo the apple at (9,0) seems reachable in 5 moves. Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (7,3). Move DOWN to (7,2). Then RIGHT to (8,2). Then RIGHT to (9,2). Then DOWN to (9,1). Then DOWN to (9,0). That's 5 moves. Each step is safe as long as no other snakes block the way. Since the enemy is at (2,6), they are far away. So this path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, after moving DOWN to (7,2), next move could be DOWN again to (7,1), then RIGHT to (8,1), (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's also 5 moves. Either path works.\n\nSo moving DOWN now starts that journey. But is there any immediate danger? Moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. The current position is (7,3), body at (8,3). So moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. No snakes or walls there.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (6,3) is also safe. But which path leads to an apple faster?\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,2), then towards (9,0), that's 5 moves. If I go LEFT to (6,3), then towards (2,4), that's 5 moves. But the enemy might reach (2,4) first. So perhaps the (9,0) apple is safer.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right corner. The snake's current position is (7,3). Moving down and right would get there. But the enemy is at (2,6), which is far away. So that's a good target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is still an option. But the enemy can reach it faster. So perhaps not.\n\nSo the best options are either (2,4) or (9,0). Since (9,0) is further but safer, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nBut let's think again. If I move LEFT now to (6,3), then next move LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT to (4,3), etc., towards (2,4). But the enemy is at (2,6). They could move down to (2,5), then (2,4). So they can reach it in two moves. So even if I start moving left, they can get there first. So that's not good.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (9,0) is better. So the first step would be DOWN to (7,2). Then proceed right and down.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT is not possible because the body is at (8,3). So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nSo the best move now is DOWN to (7,2) to start heading towards (9,0). That seems safer and less contested.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's check the positions. The closest apples might be (2,4) and (0,7). Wait, (2,4) is two steps left and two up from my current position (7,2). To get there, I need to move left and up. But let's calculate the distance. From (7,2) to (2,4): the x difference is 5 left, y difference is 2 up. So Manhattan distance is 7. Hmm. Alternatively, (0,7) is 7 left and 5 up. That's even further. The apple at (9,3) is to the right and up. From (7,2), moving right two and up one. That's a Manhattan distance of 3. That's closer. Oh, right, (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. So from (7,2), moving right twice and up once. So that's a shorter path. But wait, moving right would take me towards (9,3). Let me check the path. If I go right to (8,2), then right again to (9,2), then up to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, maybe I can go up first. If I go up to (7,3), then right twice to (9,3). That's also three moves. Either way. But maybe the enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my immediate path. So maybe the apple at (9,3) is the best target. Also, the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (7,2), moving down two and right two. But that's a longer path. So (9,3) seems the closest.\n\nWait, but the snake is at (7,2). Let me check possible directions. The possible moves are UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2). Which direction gets me closer to (9,3). If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (7,3), then RIGHT twice. Also three moves. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a straight path. Also, moving right now would take me towards the apple. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. Let's check the next steps. If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (9,2). Then UP to (9,3) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP now, then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. Wait, no. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. So total of three moves as well. Hmm. So either path is the same length. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a direct approach. Also, if I go right now, I can get closer to the apple. Let me check if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my path. The other apples are further away. So moving towards (9,3) seems the best option. So the first move should be RIGHT. Wait, but what about the apple at (3,9)? That's at the top middle. From (7,2), that's left 4 and up 7. That's a longer path. So not worth it right now. The apple at (0,7) is even further. So (9,3) is the closest. So direction RIGHT. But wait, what if I go UP first? Let's see. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go RIGHT twice and then UP once. Either way. But maybe moving right first is better. Because if I go right now, then next move right again, then up. But after moving right to (8,2), the next move to (9,2) is possible. Then up to (9,3). So that's three steps. Alternatively, if I go up first, then right twice. Both paths are safe. So which is better? Maybe the path that allows me to collect other apples next. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. So moving right first. So direction RIGHT. But wait, the apple at (9,0) is also in the same column. But that's down. From (7,2), moving down to (7,1) then right to (8,1), etc. But that's a longer path. So not worth it. So the best move is RIGHT towards (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But let me check if moving right is safe. The next position would be (8,2). Is there any snake there? The enemy snake is at (6,7), so no. The body is empty. So (8,2) is safe. Then moving right again to (9,2). Then up to (9,3). All safe. So yes. So the first move should be RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me think again. If I go UP first, then I can reach (7,3), then right twice. But maybe that's the same. So either direction is okay. But perhaps moving right first is better because it's a straight line towards the apple. So I'll choose RIGHT. The next move would be RIGHT again, then UP. So the first move is RIGHT. That's the direction to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body.\n\nSo, my current position is (8,2). The closest apple is (9,3), which is one step right and one up from here. If I move right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3). Either way, two moves. But since I'm at (8,2), moving right to (9,2) would get me closer. Then next turn, I can go up to eat the apple. But wait, moving right now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge of the board. Then next move up to (9,3) is safe. But I need to make sure there's no collision. The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) would also be a step towards the apple. Then right to (9,3). That's also two moves. Which path is better? Both are the same distance, but moving right first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple's x-coordinate. Also, after eating the apple at (9,3), I can consider other apples. \n\nWait, but if I move right to (9,2), then next move up to (9,3) to get the apple. That would grow my body. Then I need to avoid running into myself. But since my body is currently empty, after eating the apple, my body would be at (9,3), but the next move would be to leave that spot. So no immediate danger. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples nearby after getting (9,3)? The next closest might be (3,9) or (0,7). But those are further. Alternatively, after (9,3), maybe (9,0) is another apple in the same column. But that's down from (9,3) to (9,0), which is three steps down. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,3), maybe head towards (3,9) which is at the top. But that's a long way. So perhaps after getting (9,3), the next move would be to plan for another apple. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. \n\nSo the best move now is RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But wait, moving right from (8,2) to (9,2) is valid. No snakes or walls there. So that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP now to (8,3), then next move right to (9,3). That's one step less. Wait, no. From (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then right to (9,3) would take two moves. Same as moving right then up. So both paths take two moves. But moving right first allows me to be on the same x as the apple, which might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be better in case there's a risk of the enemy snake approaching. But the enemy is at (5,7), which is not near. So either direction is safe. \n\nHmm. So the decision is between RIGHT or UP. Which is better? Let's think about possible next steps. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move UP to (9,3). Then after eating the apple, I can go left to (8,3) or down to (9,2) (but that's my previous position, which is safe since my body hasn't grown yet). Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after eating the apple at (9,3), my body would be at (9,3), and the next move would extend. So if I go right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) (eating the apple), then the next move would be to move in a direction that doesn't hit myself. For example, if I go left to (8,3), that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3) (eating the apple), then next move could be up to (9,4) or right (but right is a wall). So up would be better. \n\nBut both paths are valid. However, moving right first might be better because it positions me closer to the edge, which could be a risk if I can't turn, but in this case, after moving right to (9,2), I can still go up. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer in case there's an unexpected obstacle. But given the current board, both are safe. \n\nSince both options are equally good, but the apple is at (9,3), moving right now would take me closer in x-coordinate. So I'll choose RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT, which took me from (7,2) to (8,2). Now, moving RIGHT again to (9,2) is possible. Then next move UP to (9,3). That's the plan. So the direction is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (9,3) with the body part at (9,2). The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). Wait, the board state shows an apple at (9,9) as well? Wait, the user listed apples at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). But in the board diagram, there's an A at (9,9) in row 9, which is (3,9) maybe? Let me check again.\n\nThe board state shows row 9 as \". . . A . . . . . .\", which would be x=3, y=9. So that's (3,9), which is one of the listed apples. The other apples are at (0,7) (row 7, x=0), (9,0) (row 0, x=9), (2,4) (row 4, x=2), (1,1) (row 1, x=1). So the available apples are those positions.\n\nMy snake is at (9,3) with body at [(9,2)]. So the head is at (9,3), and the tail is at (9,2). So the snake is moving upwards, since the body is behind it. Wait, the last move was UP, which moved the head from (9,2) to (9,3) in the previous step. Now, the current position is head at (9,3), body at (9,2). So the snake is facing UP, because moving from (9,2) to (9,3) was UP. So the next move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (4,6) with body at []. So their head is at (4,6), no body. So they're just a single segment. They might be moving towards apples as well.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples without dying. Let's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent head at (9,3). Possible directions:\n\nUP: to (9,4). Is that within the grid? Yes, since y ranges from 0 to 9. So (9,4) is valid. Are there any apples there? Looking at the apples list, no. So moving UP would not collect an apple. But maybe there's an apple nearby. Wait, the apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest apple to (9,3) is (9,0) but that's far down. The next closest might be (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. But that's quite a distance. Alternatively, (1,1) is at the bottom left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,9) but according to the list, that's (3,9). Wait, the user's listed apples include (3,9), which is x=3, y=9. So that's in the top middle. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=3 would take a while. \n\nSo the immediate options are to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nUP: (9,4). Is that safe? No enemies there. Also, my own body is at (9,2) and (9,3) is the head. So moving to (9,4) would not collide with myself. So that's safe.\n\nDOWN: (9,2). That's where the body is. So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. That's a death. So can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (8,3). Is that safe? Let's check. Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (4,6), which is far away. So (8,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (10,3) which is outside the grid. So that's a wall. Can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple? Let's see. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest ones are (9,0) which is way down, but moving down would require going through (9,2) which is the body. So that's not possible. The other apples are (3,9) which is up and to the left. So moving UP would take me to (9,4), then maybe continue left towards (8,4), etc., but that's a long path. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (8,3) and then proceeding left towards (7,3), etc., but that's not directly towards any apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. So to reach that, I need to move left from (9,3) towards x=3, but y needs to go up to 9. So moving left and up. Alternatively, the apple at (2,4) is at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left to x=2 and up to y=4. That's a possible path. But that's 7 steps left and 1 up. So maybe moving left towards that direction.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is at x=1, y=1. That's down and left. But moving down would hit the body. So not possible.\n\nThe apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. That's up and left. From (9,3), moving left and up. So perhaps moving left towards (8,3), then (7,3), etc., while moving up towards y=7.\n\nBut which direction now gives the best path towards an apple without getting stuck?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,0) which is at the bottom right. But to get there, I need to move down from (9,3) to (9,2), which is my body. So that's impossible. So that apple is not reachable unless I can loop around, but with the current body, moving down is blocked.\n\nSo the available apples are (3,9), (2,4), (0,7), (1,1). The closest is (2,4) at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=2 and up to y=4. So moving left (to x=8, then 7, etc.) and up (to y=4). So the first step could be LEFT to (8,3), then next steps continue left and up.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nWhich path is safer? Let's consider possible risks. The enemy snake is at (4,6). They might be moving towards apples as well. But they are far away. So immediate danger is low.\n\nSo the options are UP or LEFT. Which one is better?\n\nIf I move UP to (9,4), then next move could be LEFT to (8,4), then continue left. That path might lead towards the apple at (3,9) but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving LEFT now to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then left again. Either way, the path is similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. So moving left from (9,3) to x=3 would take 6 steps left (from 9 to 3), and moving up from y=3 to 9 would take 6 steps up. So that's a long path. The apple at (2,4) is x=2, y=4. So moving left 7 steps and up 1 step. That's a longer left move but less up.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is x=0, y=7. So moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's even further.\n\nSo perhaps the closest apple is (2,4). Let's check the distance. From (9,3) to (2,4): Manhattan distance is (9-2)+(4-3)=7+1=8. To (3,9): (9-3)+(9-3)=6+6=12. To (0,7): 9+4=13. So (2,4) is the closest.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (2,4). To get there, I need to move left and up. So from (9,3), moving LEFT to (8,3) is a step in that direction. Then next steps would continue left and maybe up. Alternatively, moving UP first to (9,4), then left. But moving UP first might not be as efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now starts the journey towards (2,4). Let's see: if I move LEFT to (8,3), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. But to reach (2,4), I need to eventually move up once. So perhaps moving LEFT now is better.\n\nBut wait, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) would be moving towards (2,4) as well. The Manhattan distance from (9,4) to (2,4) is 7 in x-direction, same as from (8,3) to (2,4) which is 6 in x and 1 in y. So both are similar. But moving LEFT first reduces the x distance more quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards the same apple. But since they are at (4,6), they might be heading towards (2,4) as well. So perhaps moving towards (2,4) could lead to a collision. But given that the enemy is at (4,6), they are closer to (2,4) than I am. So maybe that's not the best target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. But that's further away. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go LEFT to (8,3) to start moving towards the center, which gives more options. Then, from there, I can decide to go UP or continue LEFT based on the next board state.\n\nBut since the current move needs to be decided now, between UP and LEFT.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move UP to (9,4), then next turn I can move LEFT to (8,4), which is a step towards (2,4). But moving UP now doesn't collect any apple. Moving LEFT now also doesn't collect an apple, but starts the journey towards (2,4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple I can reach in fewer steps. Let me check the apples again. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). From (9,3), the closest is (2,4) as discussed. The next closest is (3,9) which is 6 left and 6 up. So moving towards (2,4) is better.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT towards (2,4). So the next move should be LEFT to (8,3). That's safe, no collision. Then, next turn, move LEFT again to (7,3), and so on. But need to check if that's the best path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) might also be a path. But which is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I go LEFT now: (9,3) \u2192 (8,3). Next move could be LEFT to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. To reach (2,4), I need to go up once. So after moving left 7 times to (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 8 moves.\n\nIf I go UP now: (9,3) \u2192 (9,4). Then LEFT to (8,4), then left to (7,4), etc. To reach (2,4), need to go left 7 times from (9,4) to (2,4). That's 7 moves left. So total 8 moves (1 up +7 left). Same as the other path.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving LEFT first starts reducing the x-coordinate immediately, which might be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple that becomes reachable along the way. For example, if I move left to (8,3), then up to (8,4), which is closer to (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is moving towards (2,4) as well. If they are at (4,6), moving down and left could reach (2,4) in a few steps. So perhaps that apple is risky. Maybe I should target a different apple.\n\nLooking at (3,9), which is at x=3, y=9. From (9,3), moving left to x=3 (6 steps) and up to y=9 (6 steps). That's a longer path, but maybe safer if the enemy isn't heading there.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. From (9,3), moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's a long way, but maybe possible.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (4,6), they might be closer to (0,7) as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (2,4), even if there's a risk. Because otherwise, the enemy might get it first, and I need to collect points.\n\nSo, given that, moving LEFT now to (8,3) is a step towards (2,4). That seems reasonable.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT to (8,3), the body will be at (9,3) and (9,2). Wait, no. Wait, the current body is [(9,2)], and the head is at (9,3). So when I move LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)]. Wait, no. When the snake moves, the tail follows. Since the snake's body is only [(9,2)] and the head is at (9,3), moving the head to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3), (9,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2 (head at (9,3), body at (9,2)), then moving LEFT to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) would move to (9,3) if the snake didn't eat an apple. Wait, but the snake only grows when it eats an apple. So in this case, moving to (8,3) does not eat an apple, so the snake's length remains 2. So the new head is (8,3), and the body is [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the head moves, each body segment moves into the previous position. So if the snake is [ (9,3) (head), (9,2) (body) ], then moving LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [ (9,3) ], and the tail (9,2) is removed. So the snake's length remains 2. So after moving LEFT, the snake is at (8,3) with body at [(9,3)]. So the next move, if I move LEFT again, the body would be [(8,3), (9,3)], etc.\n\nBut in this case, moving LEFT to (8,3) is safe. No collision with self or others. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) is also safe. But no apple there. So which is better? Moving towards the apple or exploring.\n\nSince the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the nearest one is better. So LEFT is better.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with no body.\n\nPossible moves from (7,3) are UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), or RIGHT to (8,3). Wait, but the body is at (8,3), so moving RIGHT would hit my own body. So RIGHT is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's check the path. From (7,3), moving LEFT towards (6,3) would get me closer to (2,4). Moving UP to (7,4) could head towards (3,9). Moving DOWN to (7,2) might not be near any apples immediately.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6). If I go towards (2,4), the enemy might be moving towards that apple too. But since they're at (2,6), they could move down to (2,5) then (2,4). But maybe I can reach it first if I move left now.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (3,9) might be safer. From (7,3), moving UP to (7,4), then LEFT towards (6,4), (5,4), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top right. To get there, I need to go up and left. But maybe that's a longer route.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,0) in the bottom right. But that's far from my current position. The apple at (1,1) is also possible, but again, far.\n\nSo the nearest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's calculate the distance. From (7,3) to (2,4): that's 5 units left and 1 up. Total of 6 moves. To (3,9): 4 left and 6 up. So (2,4) is closer.\n\nIf I move LEFT now to (6,3), that's one step closer. Then continue left towards (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 5 moves. But the enemy is at (2,6). They might reach (2,4) in two moves: (2,5), (2,4). So if I take 5 moves, they could get there first. Hmm, maybe not the best plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. From (7,3), moving UP to (7,4), then left to (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), then up to (3,5), (3,6)... Wait, the enemy is at (2,6). So moving up to (3,9) might not conflict with them. But that's a longer path. However, if I can get there without competition, it's worth it.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left to (6,3), then up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), then left to (5,7), etc. That's a longer path. Maybe not the best.\n\nSo between (2,4) and (3,9), which is better? (2,4) is closer but riskier due to the enemy. (3,9) is further but maybe safer.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (2,6). If they move towards (2,4), they can get there in two moves. But maybe they are going elsewhere. Since they have no body, they might be heading for apples too. If they go down to (2,5), then (2,4), but maybe they are going towards (3,9) as well. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,1). From (7,3), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down to (7,2), then right to (8,2), (9,2), then down to (9,1), (9,0). But that's 4 moves. But the enemy might not be going there. However, that's a possible path.\n\nBut considering the current position, the closest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's think again. If I move LEFT to (6,3), that's one step closer to (2,4). Then next move, I can go LEFT again to (5,3), etc. But the enemy might reach (2,4) first. Alternatively, if I move UP to (7,4), then next move LEFT to (6,4), then up towards (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (2,4). Maybe they are going for (3,9) as well. But their position is (2,6). To reach (3,9), they need to move right and up. So maybe they are heading that way. If I go for (3,9), I might have competition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go LEFT towards (2,4) and try to get there before the enemy. If I can reach it in 5 moves, and the enemy in 2, then I can't. But maybe the enemy isn't moving directly towards it. Since their last move isn't known, perhaps they are moving in another direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move UP to (7,4) to start heading towards (3,9). That way, I can avoid potential conflict with the enemy. Let's see: from (7,4), next move could be LEFT to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), etc. That's a longer path but maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) might not be useful unless there's an apple there. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best.\n\nSo between LEFT and UP. If I go LEFT, I'm moving towards (2,4) but risk the enemy. If I go UP, I'm moving towards (3,9) but it's a longer path. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple. The apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is in the bottom left. From (7,3), moving left and down. But again, long path.\n\nHmm. The enemy is at (2,6). If they move down to (2,5), then (2,4), they can reach the apple in two moves. If I move left now, I can reach (2,4) in 5 moves. So the enemy would get there first. So maybe that's not a good idea.\n\nTherefore, perhaps moving UP towards (3,9) is better. Let's calculate the steps. From (7,3) to (3,9): need to move left 4 and up 6. So 10 moves. But that's a long way. But maybe the enemy isn't going there. If the enemy is at (2,6), they can reach (3,9) in 3 moves (right to 3,6; up to 3,7; up to 3,8; up to 3,9). So 3 moves. But I need 10 moves, which is way longer. So they would get there first. So that's not good either.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to consider other apples. The apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down to (7,2), then right to (8,2), (9,2), then down to (9,1), (9,0). That's 4 moves. But is that possible? Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (7,3). Move DOWN to (7,2). Then RIGHT to (8,2). Then RIGHT to (9,2). Then DOWN to (9,1). Then DOWN to (9,0). That's 5 moves. But the enemy might not be going there. If I can reach that apple in 5 moves, that's possible. But is there any obstacle? The board shows no snakes in that area. The enemy is at (2,6), so they are far away. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nBut why didn't I consider that earlier? Because the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down and right. Let's check the path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. Then RIGHT to (8,2), (9,2). Then down to (9,1), (9,0). That's a possible path. But is there any snake in that area? The board shows snake #1 at (2,6), and my snake at (7,3) and (8,3). So the path to (9,0) seems clear.\n\nSo maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) is a good start towards (9,0). But is that the best option? Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: LEFT towards (2,4) - risky due to enemy.\n\nOption 2: UP towards (3,9) - enemy can reach faster.\n\nOption 3: DOWN towards (9,0) - longer path but safer.\n\nOption 4: Other apples.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is also possible. From (7,3), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left and up. But again, long path.\n\nSo the apple at (9,0) seems reachable in 5 moves. Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (7,3). Move DOWN to (7,2). Then RIGHT to (8,2). Then RIGHT to (9,2). Then DOWN to (9,1). Then DOWN to (9,0). That's 5 moves. Each step is safe as long as no other snakes block the way. Since the enemy is at (2,6), they are far away. So this path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, after moving DOWN to (7,2), next move could be DOWN again to (7,1), then RIGHT to (8,1), (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's also 5 moves. Either path works.\n\nSo moving DOWN now starts that journey. But is there any immediate danger? Moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. The current position is (7,3), body at (8,3). So moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. No snakes or walls there.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (6,3) is also safe. But which path leads to an apple faster?\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,2), then towards (9,0), that's 5 moves. If I go LEFT to (6,3), then towards (2,4), that's 5 moves. But the enemy might reach (2,4) first. So perhaps the (9,0) apple is safer.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right corner. The snake's current position is (7,3). Moving down and right would get there. But the enemy is at (2,6), which is far away. So that's a good target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is still an option. But the enemy can reach it faster. So perhaps not.\n\nSo the best options are either (2,4) or (9,0). Since (9,0) is further but safer, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nBut let's think again. If I move LEFT now to (6,3), then next move LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT to (4,3), etc., towards (2,4). But the enemy is at (2,6). They could move down to (2,5), then (2,4). So they can reach it in two moves. So even if I start moving left, they can get there first. So that's not good.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (9,0) is better. So the first step would be DOWN to (7,2). Then proceed right and down.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT is not possible because the body is at (8,3). So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nSo the best move now is DOWN to (7,2) to start heading towards (9,0). That seems safer and less contested.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

          "2": {
            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The current position of my snake is (8,2) with the body segment at (7,2). So the snake is moving right from (7,2) to (8,2) in the last move. Now, the next move needs to avoid colliding into itself or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples available: (0,7), (9,0), (3,9), (1,1), (2,6). Wait, the board state shows apples at (0,7), (9,0), (3,9), (1,1), (2,6). So those are the targets. \n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,4) with body at [(2,5)]. So their head is at (2,4), and their body is at (2,5). That means they are moving downward. They might be heading towards the apple at (2,6) if they go up, but their current direction is down. Hmm, maybe they are moving away from their body. \n\nMy snake is at (8,2). The possible moves are UP to (8,3), DOWN to (8,1), LEFT to (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,2). Wait, the current position is (8,2), and the body is at (7,2). So moving LEFT back to (7,2) would collide with the body. So LEFT is invalid. So valid moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, check each direction:\n\n- UP to (8,3): Is that safe? The board state shows that row 8 (y=8) is empty except for the apple at (3,9) which is far. But moving up to (8,3) would be a new position. Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (2,4), so no. So UP is possible.\n\n- DOWN to (8,1): Also safe. No immediate threats here. \n\n- RIGHT to (9,2): That's the edge of the board (x=9). Then, next move from there, if I go right again, I'd hit the wall. But moving right now is allowed. However, after moving to (9,2), the next move would need to be either UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But the apple at (9,0) is two steps down from (9,2). So if I go RIGHT to (9,2), then DOWN twice to reach (9,0). But need to check if that path is clear. Also, the enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat there.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (9,0) and (2,6). (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (8,2), moving RIGHT to (9,2) and then DOWN twice would reach (9,0). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1), then RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Either way, but moving RIGHT first might be more direct.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,6) is at (2,6). From (8,2), that's six units left. But the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is two below (2,6). If the enemy moves up, they could reach (2,5) next, then (2,6). So maybe that apple is risky to go for.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is at (1,1). From (8,2), moving left and down. But that's a longer path, and the enemy might not be there. But maybe not worth it.\n\nThe apple at (3,9) is at the top. From (8,2), moving up and left. That's a long way, and there might be other snakes or obstacles. Not sure.\n\nThe apple at (0,7) is at the left top. Also far. \n\nSo the closest and safest apple seems to be (9,0). So moving towards that. \n\nBut wait, moving RIGHT to (9,2) is valid. Then next move would be DOWN to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). But need to make sure that path is clear. The board state shows that at (9,0) there's an apple. So if I can reach there in two moves, that's good. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1) would get me closer to (9,0) as well. Then RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Same number of steps. \n\nBut which direction is better now? Let's see. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move I can go DOWN to (9,1). But after that, moving DOWN to (9,0) would get the apple. However, moving RIGHT now would take me to the edge. If I go RIGHT, then next move I can't go RIGHT again (since x=9 is max). So from (9,2), possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1) would allow me to then go RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's also two steps. \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check the board for any obstacles. The board state shows that in row 2 (y=2), there's a T (maybe a tail?) at (7,2) and (8,2) is my head. So moving RIGHT to (9,2) is safe. Then, in row 9 (x=9), the column from y=0 to y=9. The apple is at (9,0). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge. If I go RIGHT, then next turn I have to move either UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But moving LEFT would take me back to (8,2), which is where my body is. Wait, no. After moving to (9,2), my body would be at (8,2) and (7,2). So next move, if I go LEFT to (8,2), that's where my body is, so that's a collision. So after moving RIGHT to (9,2), the next move must be either UP or DOWN. \n\nSo if I go RIGHT now, then next move I have to go UP or DOWN. Let's say I go DOWN to (9,1). Then the next move would be DOWN to (9,0) to get the apple. That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, if I go DOWN now to (8,1), then next move I can go RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). \n\nWhich path is shorter? Both take two moves after the initial move. But moving RIGHT first might be better because it's a direct path towards the edge, which is closer to the apple. \n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no other snakes in the path. The enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away. So the path to (9,0) seems clear. \n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move RIGHT to (9,2), then I'm on the edge. If another snake appears near there, I might get trapped. But currently, there's no other snake there. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (9,2), then proceed down towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (8,1) would start moving towards (9,0) but in a different path. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge. Then, next move I can go DOWN to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (8,1), then RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Also two moves. \n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving RIGHT first might be better because it's a straight line towards the edge, which is closer to the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might be safer in case there's something I'm missing. \n\nWait, the board state shows that at (9,0) there's an apple, and the rest of the path is clear. So either path is okay. \n\nBut since moving RIGHT now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge, but that's allowed. So the next move would be DOWN. \n\nSo the decision is between RIGHT, DOWN, or UP. \n\nWait, UP is also an option. Moving UP to (8,3). What's there? The board shows that at (8,3) there's nothing. Then, from there, maybe head towards other apples. But the closest apple is (9,0), so moving UP might take me away from it. Unless there's another apple in that direction. The apples at (3,9) and (0,7) are in the upper areas. But (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. From (8,3), moving left and up would take a while. \n\nSo moving UP might not be the best choice if the goal is to get the closest apple. \n\nTherefore, the best options are RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nBetween RIGHT and DOWN, which is better? \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move I can go DOWN to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's two moves. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), then next move RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Also two moves. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now would put me on the edge, which might limit future moves. For example, after (9,2), I can only move UP or DOWN. If I go DOWN to (9,1), then next move to (9,0), which is the apple. Then after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the body would be longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (8,1) allows more flexibility. From (8,1), I can go RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Or maybe other directions if needed. \n\nBut since the apple is at (9,0), moving towards it directly seems better. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (2,4). They might be heading towards the apple at (2,6). If they move up twice, they can reach it. But their current position is (2,4), body at (2,5). So they can't move up to (2,5) because that's their body. Wait, their head is at (2,4), body at (2,5). So their possible moves are left, right, or down. Because moving up would go to (2,5), which is their body. So they can't move up. So they can move left to (1,4), right to (3,4), or down to (2,3). So they can't reach (2,6) in the next move. Therefore, the apple at (2,6) is safe for now. \n\nBut for my snake, (2,6) is far. So focusing on (9,0) is better. \n\nSo back to the decision: RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move must be DOWN. If I go DOWN to (8,1), next move can be RIGHT. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first is better to avoid being on the edge. Because being on the edge limits movement options. For example, if I'm at (9,2), next move can only be UP or DOWN. If there's a threat coming from those directions, I can't escape. But currently, there's no threat there. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (8,1) allows more flexibility. From there, I can go RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). \n\nBut both options are valid. \n\nAnother angle: the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right. If I move RIGHT now, I'm closer to it. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple in terms of y-coordinate. \n\nWait, (8,2) to (9,2) is moving right, same y. Then to (9,1) is down, then (9,0). \n\nFrom (8,2) to (8,1) is down, then to (9,1) is right, then to (9,0) is down. \n\nEither way, same steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might be safer in case there's an obstacle I'm not seeing. \n\nLooking at the board state again: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) has my snake's head at (8,2) and body at (7,2). The rest of the row is clear. \n\nRow 1 (y=1) has an apple at (1,1). \n\nRow 0 (y=0) has an apple at (9,0). \n\nSo moving DOWN to (8,1) would be in row 1, which is clear except for the apple at (1,1). \n\nSo both directions are safe. \n\nHmm. Maybe it's a tie. But since the apple is at (9,0), moving RIGHT first gets me closer in x-coordinate. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer in y-coordinate. \n\nBut since both are needed, it's the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT is better because after that, moving down twice gets the apple. \n\nBut I need to make sure that after moving RIGHT, the next move is possible. \n\nSo the decision is between RIGHT and DOWN. \n\nSince both are valid, but moving RIGHT would start heading towards the edge, which might be riskier if there's a sudden obstacle. But given the current board state, it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (9,2), then proceed down towards the apple.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (7,2) with an empty body. The apples are at (9,3), (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (6,7) with no body either. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. Let's check the positions. The closest apples might be (2,4) and (0,7). Wait, (2,4) is two steps left and two up from my current position (7,2). To get there, I need to move left and up. But let's calculate the distance. From (7,2) to (2,4): the x difference is 5 left, y difference is 2 up. So Manhattan distance is 7. Hmm. Alternatively, (0,7) is 7 left and 5 up. That's even further. The apple at (9,3) is to the right and up. From (7,2), moving right two and up one. That's a Manhattan distance of 3. That's closer. Oh, right, (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. So from (7,2), moving right twice and up once. So that's a shorter path. But wait, moving right would take me towards (9,3). Let me check the path. If I go right to (8,2), then right again to (9,2), then up to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, maybe I can go up first. If I go up to (7,3), then right twice to (9,3). That's also three moves. Either way. But maybe the enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my immediate path. So maybe the apple at (9,3) is the best target. Also, the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (7,2), moving down two and right two. But that's a longer path. So (9,3) seems the closest.\n\nWait, but the snake is at (7,2). Let me check possible directions. The possible moves are UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2). Which direction gets me closer to (9,3). If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP first to (7,3), then RIGHT twice. Also three moves. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a straight path. Also, moving right now would take me towards the apple. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or other snakes. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. Let's check the next steps. If I go RIGHT to (8,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (9,2). Then UP to (9,3) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go UP now, then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. Wait, no. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's two moves after the first. So total of three moves as well. Hmm. So either path is the same length. But maybe moving right first is better because it's a direct approach. Also, if I go right now, I can get closer to the apple. Let me check if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (6,7), which is not in my path. The other apples are further away. So moving towards (9,3) seems the best option. So the first move should be RIGHT. Wait, but what about the apple at (3,9)? That's at the top middle. From (7,2), that's left 4 and up 7. That's a longer path. So not worth it right now. The apple at (0,7) is even further. So (9,3) is the closest. So direction RIGHT. But wait, what if I go UP first? Let's see. If I go UP to (7,3), then next move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, if I go RIGHT twice and then UP once. Either way. But maybe moving right first is better. Because if I go right now, then next move right again, then up. But after moving right to (8,2), the next move to (9,2) is possible. Then up to (9,3). So that's three steps. Alternatively, if I go up first, then right twice. Both paths are safe. So which is better? Maybe the path that allows me to collect other apples next. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. So moving right first. So direction RIGHT. But wait, the apple at (9,0) is also in the same column. But that's down. From (7,2), moving down to (7,1) then right to (8,1), etc. But that's a longer path. So not worth it. So the best move is RIGHT towards (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But let me check if moving right is safe. The next position would be (8,2). Is there any snake there? The enemy snake is at (6,7), so no. The body is empty. So (8,2) is safe. Then moving right again to (9,2). Then up to (9,3). All safe. So yes. So the first move should be RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me think again. If I go UP first, then I can reach (7,3), then right twice. But maybe that's the same. So either direction is okay. But perhaps moving right first is better because it's a straight line towards the apple. So I'll choose RIGHT. The next move would be RIGHT again, then UP. So the first move is RIGHT. That's the direction to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (8,2) after moving right last time. The apples are still at (9,3), (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (5,7) with no body.\n\nSo, my current position is (8,2). The closest apple is (9,3), which is one step right and one up from here. If I move right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3). Either way, two moves. But since I'm at (8,2), moving right to (9,2) would get me closer. Then next turn, I can go up to eat the apple. But wait, moving right now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge of the board. Then next move up to (9,3) is safe. But I need to make sure there's no collision. The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is far away. So moving right is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up from (8,2) to (8,3) would also be a step towards the apple. Then right to (9,3). That's also two moves. Which path is better? Both are the same distance, but moving right first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple's x-coordinate. Also, after eating the apple at (9,3), I can consider other apples. \n\nWait, but if I move right to (9,2), then next move up to (9,3) to get the apple. That would grow my body. Then I need to avoid running into myself. But since my body is currently empty, after eating the apple, my body would be at (9,3), but the next move would be to leave that spot. So no immediate danger. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples nearby after getting (9,3)? The next closest might be (3,9) or (0,7). But those are further. Alternatively, after (9,3), maybe (9,0) is another apple in the same column. But that's down from (9,3) to (9,0), which is three steps down. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (9,3), maybe head towards (3,9) which is at the top. But that's a long way. So perhaps after getting (9,3), the next move would be to plan for another apple. But for now, the priority is to get the closest apple. \n\nSo the best move now is RIGHT to (9,2), then UP to (9,3). So direction RIGHT. But wait, moving right from (8,2) to (9,2) is valid. No snakes or walls there. So that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP now to (8,3), then next move right to (9,3). That's one step less. Wait, no. From (8,2), moving up to (8,3), then right to (9,3) would take two moves. Same as moving right then up. So both paths take two moves. But moving right first allows me to be on the same x as the apple, which might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be better in case there's a risk of the enemy snake approaching. But the enemy is at (5,7), which is not near. So either direction is safe. \n\nHmm. So the decision is between RIGHT or UP. Which is better? Let's think about possible next steps. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move UP to (9,3). Then after eating the apple, I can go left to (8,3) or down to (9,2) (but that's my previous position, which is safe since my body hasn't grown yet). Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after eating the apple at (9,3), my body would be at (9,3), and the next move would extend. So if I go right to (9,2), then up to (9,3) (eating the apple), then the next move would be to move in a direction that doesn't hit myself. For example, if I go left to (8,3), that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I go up first to (8,3), then right to (9,3) (eating the apple), then next move could be up to (9,4) or right (but right is a wall). So up would be better. \n\nBut both paths are valid. However, moving right first might be better because it positions me closer to the edge, which could be a risk if I can't turn, but in this case, after moving right to (9,2), I can still go up. \n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer in case there's an unexpected obstacle. But given the current board, both are safe. \n\nSince both options are equally good, but the apple is at (9,3), moving right now would take me closer in x-coordinate. So I'll choose RIGHT again. \n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT, which took me from (7,2) to (8,2). Now, moving RIGHT again to (9,2) is possible. Then next move UP to (9,3). That's the plan. So the direction is RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Wait, the board state shows an apple at (9,9) as well? Wait, the user listed apples at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). But in the board diagram, there's an A at (9,9) in row 9, which is (3,9) maybe? Let me check again.\n\nThe board state shows row 9 as \". . . A . . . . . .\", which would be x=3, y=9. So that's (3,9), which is one of the listed apples. The other apples are at (0,7) (row 7, x=0), (9,0) (row 0, x=9), (2,4) (row 4, x=2), (1,1) (row 1, x=1). So the available apples are those positions.\n\nMy snake is at (9,3) with body at [(9,2)]. So the head is at (9,3), and the tail is at (9,2). So the snake is moving upwards, since the body is behind it. Wait, the last move was UP, which moved the head from (9,2) to (9,3) in the previous step. Now, the current position is head at (9,3), body at (9,2). So the snake is facing UP, because moving from (9,2) to (9,3) was UP. So the next move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nLooking at the enemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (4,6) with body at []. So their head is at (4,6), no body. So they're just a single segment. They might be moving towards apples as well.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples without dying. Let's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent head at (9,3). Possible directions:\n\nUP: to (9,4). Is that within the grid? Yes, since y ranges from 0 to 9. So (9,4) is valid. Are there any apples there? Looking at the apples list, no. So moving UP would not collect an apple. But maybe there's an apple nearby. Wait, the apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest apple to (9,3) is (9,0) but that's far down. The next closest might be (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. But that's quite a distance. Alternatively, (1,1) is at the bottom left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,9) but according to the list, that's (3,9). Wait, the user's listed apples include (3,9), which is x=3, y=9. So that's in the top middle. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=3 would take a while. \n\nSo the immediate options are to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nUP: (9,4). Is that safe? No enemies there. Also, my own body is at (9,2) and (9,3) is the head. So moving to (9,4) would not collide with myself. So that's safe.\n\nDOWN: (9,2). That's where the body is. So moving DOWN would collide with my own body. That's a death. So can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (8,3). Is that safe? Let's check. Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (4,6), which is far away. So (8,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (10,3) which is outside the grid. So that's a wall. Can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple? Let's see. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The closest ones are (9,0) which is way down, but moving down would require going through (9,2) which is the body. So that's not possible. The other apples are (3,9) which is up and to the left. So moving UP would take me to (9,4), then maybe continue left towards (8,4), etc., but that's a long path. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (8,3) and then proceeding left towards (7,3), etc., but that's not directly towards any apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. So to reach that, I need to move left from (9,3) towards x=3, but y needs to go up to 9. So moving left and up. Alternatively, the apple at (2,4) is at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left to x=2 and up to y=4. That's a possible path. But that's 7 steps left and 1 up. So maybe moving left towards that direction.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is at x=1, y=1. That's down and left. But moving down would hit the body. So not possible.\n\nThe apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. That's up and left. From (9,3), moving left and up. So perhaps moving left towards (8,3), then (7,3), etc., while moving up towards y=7.\n\nBut which direction now gives the best path towards an apple without getting stuck?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (9,0) which is at the bottom right. But to get there, I need to move down from (9,3) to (9,2), which is my body. So that's impossible. So that apple is not reachable unless I can loop around, but with the current body, moving down is blocked.\n\nSo the available apples are (3,9), (2,4), (0,7), (1,1). The closest is (2,4) at x=2, y=4. So from (9,3), moving left towards x=2 and up to y=4. So moving left (to x=8, then 7, etc.) and up (to y=4). So the first step could be LEFT to (8,3), then next steps continue left and up.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nWhich path is safer? Let's consider possible risks. The enemy snake is at (4,6). They might be moving towards apples as well. But they are far away. So immediate danger is low.\n\nSo the options are UP or LEFT. Which one is better?\n\nIf I move UP to (9,4), then next move could be LEFT to (8,4), then continue left. That path might lead towards the apple at (3,9) but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving LEFT now to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then left again. Either way, the path is similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (3,9) which is at x=3, y=9. So moving left from (9,3) to x=3 would take 6 steps left (from 9 to 3), and moving up from y=3 to 9 would take 6 steps up. So that's a long path. The apple at (2,4) is x=2, y=4. So moving left 7 steps and up 1 step. That's a longer left move but less up.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is x=0, y=7. So moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's even further.\n\nSo perhaps the closest apple is (2,4). Let's check the distance. From (9,3) to (2,4): Manhattan distance is (9-2)+(4-3)=7+1=8. To (3,9): (9-3)+(9-3)=6+6=12. To (0,7): 9+4=13. So (2,4) is the closest.\n\nSo the plan is to move towards (2,4). To get there, I need to move left and up. So from (9,3), moving LEFT to (8,3) is a step in that direction. Then next steps would continue left and maybe up. Alternatively, moving UP first to (9,4), then left. But moving UP first might not be as efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now starts the journey towards (2,4). Let's see: if I move LEFT to (8,3), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. But to reach (2,4), I need to eventually move up once. So perhaps moving LEFT now is better.\n\nBut wait, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) would be moving towards (2,4) as well. The Manhattan distance from (9,4) to (2,4) is 7 in x-direction, same as from (8,3) to (2,4) which is 6 in x and 1 in y. So both are similar. But moving LEFT first reduces the x distance more quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards the same apple. But since they are at (4,6), they might be heading towards (2,4) as well. So perhaps moving towards (2,4) could lead to a collision. But given that the enemy is at (4,6), they are closer to (2,4) than I am. So maybe that's not the best target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. But that's further away. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go LEFT to (8,3) to start moving towards the center, which gives more options. Then, from there, I can decide to go UP or continue LEFT based on the next board state.\n\nBut since the current move needs to be decided now, between UP and LEFT.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move UP to (9,4), then next turn I can move LEFT to (8,4), which is a step towards (2,4). But moving UP now doesn't collect any apple. Moving LEFT now also doesn't collect an apple, but starts the journey towards (2,4).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple I can reach in fewer steps. Let me check the apples again. The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). From (9,3), the closest is (2,4) as discussed. The next closest is (3,9) which is 6 left and 6 up. So moving towards (2,4) is better.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT towards (2,4). So the next move should be LEFT to (8,3). That's safe, no collision. Then, next turn, move LEFT again to (7,3), and so on. But need to check if that's the best path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) and then LEFT to (8,4) might also be a path. But which is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I go LEFT now: (9,3) \u2192 (8,3). Next move could be LEFT to (7,3), then (6,3), etc. To reach (2,4), I need to go up once. So after moving left 7 times to (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 8 moves.\n\nIf I go UP now: (9,3) \u2192 (9,4). Then LEFT to (8,4), then left to (7,4), etc. To reach (2,4), need to go left 7 times from (9,4) to (2,4). That's 7 moves left. So total 8 moves (1 up +7 left). Same as the other path.\n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving LEFT first starts reducing the x-coordinate immediately, which might be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple that becomes reachable along the way. For example, if I move left to (8,3), then up to (8,4), which is closer to (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is moving towards (2,4) as well. If they are at (4,6), moving down and left could reach (2,4) in a few steps. So perhaps that apple is risky. Maybe I should target a different apple.\n\nLooking at (3,9), which is at x=3, y=9. From (9,3), moving left to x=3 (6 steps) and up to y=9 (6 steps). That's a longer path, but maybe safer if the enemy isn't heading there.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is at x=0, y=7. From (9,3), moving left 9 steps and up 4 steps. That's a long way, but maybe possible.\n\nBut given that the enemy is at (4,6), they might be closer to (0,7) as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to head towards the nearest apple, which is (2,4), even if there's a risk. Because otherwise, the enemy might get it first, and I need to collect points.\n\nSo, given that, moving LEFT now to (8,3) is a step towards (2,4). That seems reasonable.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT to (8,3), the body will be at (9,3) and (9,2). Wait, no. Wait, the current body is [(9,2)], and the head is at (9,3). So when I move LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)]. Wait, no. When the snake moves, the tail follows. Since the snake's body is only [(9,2)] and the head is at (9,3), moving the head to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3), (9,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2 (head at (9,3), body at (9,2)), then moving LEFT to (8,3) would make the new body [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) would move to (9,3) if the snake didn't eat an apple. Wait, but the snake only grows when it eats an apple. So in this case, moving to (8,3) does not eat an apple, so the snake's length remains 2. So the new head is (8,3), and the body is [(9,3)], and the tail (9,2) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's body is the segments behind the head. So when the head moves, each body segment moves into the previous position. So if the snake is [ (9,3) (head), (9,2) (body) ], then moving LEFT to (8,3), the new body becomes [ (9,3) ], and the tail (9,2) is removed. So the snake's length remains 2. So after moving LEFT, the snake is at (8,3) with body at [(9,3)]. So the next move, if I move LEFT again, the body would be [(8,3), (9,3)], etc.\n\nBut in this case, moving LEFT to (8,3) is safe. No collision with self or others. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,4) is also safe. But no apple there. So which is better? Moving towards the apple or exploring.\n\nSince the goal is to collect apples, moving towards the nearest one is better. So LEFT is better.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Possible moves are UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3), or RIGHT to (9,3). Let's check each:\n\n- **RIGHT (9,3)**: That's where my body is. Moving there would collide with myself, so that's a no-go.\n- **DOWN (8,2)**: Is there any obstacle? The board shows no snakes there. It's safe, but moving down might not be the best path towards an apple.\n- **LEFT (7,3)**: Safe, no obstacles. Moving left continues the path towards the apple at (2,4) or (0,7).\n- **UP (8,4)**: Also safe. Moving up could help approach the apple at (3,9) or (2,4) if I turn left later.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). From (8,3), moving LEFT to (7,3) gets me closer to (2,4). Moving UP to (8,4) starts heading towards (3,9). \n\nConsidering the enemy snake at (3,6), they might be moving towards (2,4) as well. If I go left, I risk a potential collision if they reach there first. However, moving up towards (3,9) might be safer since the enemy is further away from that apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now keeps me on a direct path to (2,4), which is closer. But I need to ensure the enemy isn't blocking that path. Since the enemy is at (3,6), they could move down-left towards (2,4) in a few moves. \n\nAnother consideration: moving UP to (8,4) allows more flexibility. From there, I can go left towards (7,4) and then down to (7,3) if needed, but that might take longer. \n\nGiven the immediate options, moving LEFT to (7,3) continues the path towards the nearest apple (2,4) and avoids potential conflicts with the enemy's current position.

            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (7,3) with the body at (8,3). So the head is at (7,3), and the tail is at (8,3). The apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (2,4), (3,9), (1,1). The enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with no body.\n\nPossible moves from (7,3) are UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), or RIGHT to (8,3). Wait, but the body is at (8,3), so moving RIGHT would hit my own body. So RIGHT is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's check the path. From (7,3), moving LEFT towards (6,3) would get me closer to (2,4). Moving UP to (7,4) could head towards (3,9). Moving DOWN to (7,2) might not be near any apples immediately.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6). If I go towards (2,4), the enemy might be moving towards that apple too. But since they're at (2,6), they could move down to (2,5) then (2,4). But maybe I can reach it first if I move left now.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (3,9) might be safer. From (7,3), moving UP to (7,4), then LEFT towards (6,4), (5,4), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top right. To get there, I need to go up and left. But maybe that's a longer route.\n\nAnother apple is at (9,0) in the bottom right. But that's far from my current position. The apple at (1,1) is also possible, but again, far.\n\nSo the nearest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's calculate the distance. From (7,3) to (2,4): that's 5 units left and 1 up. Total of 6 moves. To (3,9): 4 left and 6 up. So (2,4) is closer.\n\nIf I move LEFT now to (6,3), that's one step closer. Then continue left towards (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), then up to (2,4). That's 5 moves. But the enemy is at (2,6). They might reach (2,4) in two moves: (2,5), (2,4). So if I take 5 moves, they could get there first. Hmm, maybe not the best plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is safer. From (7,3), moving UP to (7,4), then left to (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), then up to (3,5), (3,6)... Wait, the enemy is at (2,6). So moving up to (3,9) might not conflict with them. But that's a longer path. However, if I can get there without competition, it's worth it.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left to (6,3), then up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), then left to (5,7), etc. That's a longer path. Maybe not the best.\n\nSo between (2,4) and (3,9), which is better? (2,4) is closer but riskier due to the enemy. (3,9) is further but maybe safer.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (2,6). If they move towards (2,4), they can get there in two moves. But maybe they are going elsewhere. Since they have no body, they might be heading for apples too. If they go down to (2,5), then (2,4), but maybe they are going towards (3,9) as well. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (1,1). From (7,3), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down to (7,2), then right to (8,2), (9,2), then down to (9,1), (9,0). But that's 4 moves. But the enemy might not be going there. However, that's a possible path.\n\nBut considering the current position, the closest apples are (2,4) and (3,9). Let's think again. If I move LEFT to (6,3), that's one step closer to (2,4). Then next move, I can go LEFT again to (5,3), etc. But the enemy might reach (2,4) first. Alternatively, if I move UP to (7,4), then next move LEFT to (6,4), then up towards (3,9). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (2,4). Maybe they are going for (3,9) as well. But their position is (2,6). To reach (3,9), they need to move right and up. So maybe they are heading that way. If I go for (3,9), I might have competition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go LEFT towards (2,4) and try to get there before the enemy. If I can reach it in 5 moves, and the enemy in 2, then I can't. But maybe the enemy isn't moving directly towards it. Since their last move isn't known, perhaps they are moving in another direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move UP to (7,4) to start heading towards (3,9). That way, I can avoid potential conflict with the enemy. Let's see: from (7,4), next move could be LEFT to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), etc. That's a longer path but maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) might not be useful unless there's an apple there. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best.\n\nSo between LEFT and UP. If I go LEFT, I'm moving towards (2,4) but risk the enemy. If I go UP, I'm moving towards (3,9) but it's a longer path. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple. The apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is in the bottom left. From (7,3), moving left and down. But again, long path.\n\nHmm. The enemy is at (2,6). If they move down to (2,5), then (2,4), they can reach the apple in two moves. If I move left now, I can reach (2,4) in 5 moves. So the enemy would get there first. So maybe that's not a good idea.\n\nTherefore, perhaps moving UP towards (3,9) is better. Let's calculate the steps. From (7,3) to (3,9): need to move left 4 and up 6. So 10 moves. But that's a long way. But maybe the enemy isn't going there. If the enemy is at (2,6), they can reach (3,9) in 3 moves (right to 3,6; up to 3,7; up to 3,8; up to 3,9). So 3 moves. But I need 10 moves, which is way longer. So they would get there first. So that's not good either.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to consider other apples. The apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down to (7,2), then right to (8,2), (9,2), then down to (9,1), (9,0). That's 4 moves. But is that possible? Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (7,3). Move DOWN to (7,2). Then RIGHT to (8,2). Then RIGHT to (9,2). Then DOWN to (9,1). Then DOWN to (9,0). That's 5 moves. But the enemy might not be going there. If I can reach that apple in 5 moves, that's possible. But is there any obstacle? The board shows no snakes in that area. The enemy is at (2,6), so they are far away. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nBut why didn't I consider that earlier? Because the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right. From (7,3), moving down and right. Let's check the path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. Then RIGHT to (8,2), (9,2). Then down to (9,1), (9,0). That's a possible path. But is there any snake in that area? The board shows snake #1 at (2,6), and my snake at (7,3) and (8,3). So the path to (9,0) seems clear.\n\nSo maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) is a good start towards (9,0). But is that the best option? Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: LEFT towards (2,4) - risky due to enemy.\n\nOption 2: UP towards (3,9) - enemy can reach faster.\n\nOption 3: DOWN towards (9,0) - longer path but safer.\n\nOption 4: Other apples.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is also possible. From (7,3), moving left and down. But that's a long way. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,7) is in the top left. From (7,3), moving left and up. But again, long path.\n\nSo the apple at (9,0) seems reachable in 5 moves. Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (7,3). Move DOWN to (7,2). Then RIGHT to (8,2). Then RIGHT to (9,2). Then DOWN to (9,1). Then DOWN to (9,0). That's 5 moves. Each step is safe as long as no other snakes block the way. Since the enemy is at (2,6), they are far away. So this path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, after moving DOWN to (7,2), next move could be DOWN again to (7,1), then RIGHT to (8,1), (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's also 5 moves. Either path works.\n\nSo moving DOWN now starts that journey. But is there any immediate danger? Moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. The current position is (7,3), body at (8,3). So moving DOWN to (7,2) is safe. No snakes or walls there.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (6,3) is also safe. But which path leads to an apple faster?\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,2), then towards (9,0), that's 5 moves. If I go LEFT to (6,3), then towards (2,4), that's 5 moves. But the enemy might reach (2,4) first. So perhaps the (9,0) apple is safer.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (9,0) is in the bottom right corner. The snake's current position is (7,3). Moving down and right would get there. But the enemy is at (2,6), which is far away. So that's a good target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is still an option. But the enemy can reach it faster. So perhaps not.\n\nSo the best options are either (2,4) or (9,0). Since (9,0) is further but safer, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nBut let's think again. If I move LEFT now to (6,3), then next move LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT to (4,3), etc., towards (2,4). But the enemy is at (2,6). They could move down to (2,5), then (2,4). So they can reach it in two moves. So even if I start moving left, they can get there first. So that's not good.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (9,0) is better. So the first step would be DOWN to (7,2). Then proceed right and down.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT is not possible because the body is at (8,3). So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nSo the best move now is DOWN to (7,2) to start heading towards (9,0). That seems safer and less contested.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The current position of my snake is (8,2) with the body segment at (7,2). So the snake is moving right from (7,2) to (8,2) in the last move. Now, the next move needs to avoid colliding into itself or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples available: (0,7), (9,0), (3,9), (1,1), (2,6). Wait, the board state shows apples at (0,7), (9,0), (3,9), (1,1), (2,6). So those are the targets. \n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,4) with body at [(2,5)]. So their head is at (2,4), and their body is at (2,5). That means they are moving downward. They might be heading towards the apple at (2,6) if they go up, but their current direction is down. Hmm, maybe they are moving away from their body. \n\nMy snake is at (8,2). The possible moves are UP to (8,3), DOWN to (8,1), LEFT to (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,2). Wait, the current position is (8,2), and the body is at (7,2). So moving LEFT back to (7,2) would collide with the body. So LEFT is invalid. So valid moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, check each direction:\n\n- UP to (8,3): Is that safe? The board state shows that row 8 (y=8) is empty except for the apple at (3,9) which is far. But moving up to (8,3) would be a new position. Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (2,4), so no. So UP is possible.\n\n- DOWN to (8,1): Also safe. No immediate threats here. \n\n- RIGHT to (9,2): That's the edge of the board (x=9). Then, next move from there, if I go right again, I'd hit the wall. But moving right now is allowed. However, after moving to (9,2), the next move would need to be either UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But the apple at (9,0) is two steps down from (9,2). So if I go RIGHT to (9,2), then DOWN twice to reach (9,0). But need to check if that path is clear. Also, the enemy snake is far away, so no immediate threat there.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (9,0) and (2,6). (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. From (8,2), moving RIGHT to (9,2) and then DOWN twice would reach (9,0). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1), then RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Either way, but moving RIGHT first might be more direct.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,6) is at (2,6). From (8,2), that's six units left. But the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is two below (2,6). If the enemy moves up, they could reach (2,5) next, then (2,6). So maybe that apple is risky to go for.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is at (1,1). From (8,2), moving left and down. But that's a longer path, and the enemy might not be there. But maybe not worth it.\n\nThe apple at (3,9) is at the top. From (8,2), moving up and left. That's a long way, and there might be other snakes or obstacles. Not sure.\n\nThe apple at (0,7) is at the left top. Also far. \n\nSo the closest and safest apple seems to be (9,0). So moving towards that. \n\nBut wait, moving RIGHT to (9,2) is valid. Then next move would be DOWN to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). But need to make sure that path is clear. The board state shows that at (9,0) there's an apple. So if I can reach there in two moves, that's good. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1) would get me closer to (9,0) as well. Then RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Same number of steps. \n\nBut which direction is better now? Let's see. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move I can go DOWN to (9,1). But after that, moving DOWN to (9,0) would get the apple. However, moving RIGHT now would take me to the edge. If I go RIGHT, then next move I can't go RIGHT again (since x=9 is max). So from (9,2), possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1) would allow me to then go RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's also two steps. \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check the board for any obstacles. The board state shows that in row 2 (y=2), there's a T (maybe a tail?) at (7,2) and (8,2) is my head. So moving RIGHT to (9,2) is safe. Then, in row 9 (x=9), the column from y=0 to y=9. The apple is at (9,0). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge. If I go RIGHT, then next turn I have to move either UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But moving LEFT would take me back to (8,2), which is where my body is. Wait, no. After moving to (9,2), my body would be at (8,2) and (7,2). So next move, if I go LEFT to (8,2), that's where my body is, so that's a collision. So after moving RIGHT to (9,2), the next move must be either UP or DOWN. \n\nSo if I go RIGHT now, then next move I have to go UP or DOWN. Let's say I go DOWN to (9,1). Then the next move would be DOWN to (9,0) to get the apple. That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, if I go DOWN now to (8,1), then next move I can go RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). \n\nWhich path is shorter? Both take two moves after the initial move. But moving RIGHT first might be better because it's a direct path towards the edge, which is closer to the apple. \n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no other snakes in the path. The enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away. So the path to (9,0) seems clear. \n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move RIGHT to (9,2), then I'm on the edge. If another snake appears near there, I might get trapped. But currently, there's no other snake there. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (9,2), then proceed down towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (8,1) would start moving towards (9,0) but in a different path. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge. Then, next move I can go DOWN to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (8,1), then RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Also two moves. \n\nSo both paths take the same number of steps. But moving RIGHT first might be better because it's a straight line towards the edge, which is closer to the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might be safer in case there's something I'm missing. \n\nWait, the board state shows that at (9,0) there's an apple, and the rest of the path is clear. So either path is okay. \n\nBut since moving RIGHT now would take me to (9,2), which is the edge, but that's allowed. So the next move would be DOWN. \n\nSo the decision is between RIGHT, DOWN, or UP. \n\nWait, UP is also an option. Moving UP to (8,3). What's there? The board shows that at (8,3) there's nothing. Then, from there, maybe head towards other apples. But the closest apple is (9,0), so moving UP might take me away from it. Unless there's another apple in that direction. The apples at (3,9) and (0,7) are in the upper areas. But (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. From (8,3), moving left and up would take a while. \n\nSo moving UP might not be the best choice if the goal is to get the closest apple. \n\nTherefore, the best options are RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nBetween RIGHT and DOWN, which is better? \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move I can go DOWN to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). That's two moves. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), then next move RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Also two moves. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now would put me on the edge, which might limit future moves. For example, after (9,2), I can only move UP or DOWN. If I go DOWN to (9,1), then next move to (9,0), which is the apple. Then after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the body would be longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (8,1) allows more flexibility. From (8,1), I can go RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). Or maybe other directions if needed. \n\nBut since the apple is at (9,0), moving towards it directly seems better. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (2,4). They might be heading towards the apple at (2,6). If they move up twice, they can reach it. But their current position is (2,4), body at (2,5). So they can't move up to (2,5) because that's their body. Wait, their head is at (2,4), body at (2,5). So their possible moves are left, right, or down. Because moving up would go to (2,5), which is their body. So they can't move up. So they can move left to (1,4), right to (3,4), or down to (2,3). So they can't reach (2,6) in the next move. Therefore, the apple at (2,6) is safe for now. \n\nBut for my snake, (2,6) is far. So focusing on (9,0) is better. \n\nSo back to the decision: RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,2), then next move must be DOWN. If I go DOWN to (8,1), next move can be RIGHT. \n\nBut both paths are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first is better to avoid being on the edge. Because being on the edge limits movement options. For example, if I'm at (9,2), next move can only be UP or DOWN. If there's a threat coming from those directions, I can't escape. But currently, there's no threat there. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (8,1) allows more flexibility. From there, I can go RIGHT to (9,1), then DOWN to (9,0). \n\nBut both options are valid. \n\nAnother angle: the apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right. If I move RIGHT now, I'm closer to it. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now gets me closer to the apple in terms of y-coordinate. \n\nWait, (8,2) to (9,2) is moving right, same y. Then to (9,1) is down, then (9,0). \n\nFrom (8,2) to (8,1) is down, then to (9,1) is right, then to (9,0) is down. \n\nEither way, same steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might be safer in case there's an obstacle I'm not seeing. \n\nLooking at the board state again: \n\nRow 2 (y=2) has my snake's head at (8,2) and body at (7,2). The rest of the row is clear. \n\nRow 1 (y=1) has an apple at (1,1). \n\nRow 0 (y=0) has an apple at (9,0). \n\nSo moving DOWN to (8,1) would be in row 1, which is clear except for the apple at (1,1). \n\nSo both directions are safe. \n\nHmm. Maybe it's a tie. But since the apple is at (9,0), moving RIGHT first gets me closer in x-coordinate. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer in y-coordinate. \n\nBut since both are needed, it's the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT is better because after that, moving down twice gets the apple. \n\nBut I need to make sure that after moving RIGHT, the next move is possible. \n\nSo the decision is between RIGHT and DOWN. \n\nSince both are valid, but moving RIGHT would start heading towards the edge, which might be riskier if there's a sudden obstacle. But given the current board state, it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (9,2), then proceed down towards the apple.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The last move was RIGHT, so the snake was previously at (8,2) and moved right to (9,2). Now, the next move needs to avoid collisions and aim for apples.\n\nAvailable apples are at (0,7), (9,0), (3,9), (1,1), and (2,6). The closest apple is (9,0), which is two steps down from the current position. Moving DOWN from (9,2) to (9,1) and then DOWN again to (9,0) would secure that apple. However, moving DOWN now from (9,2) is possible. Wait, the current head is at (9,2), so possible moves are UP to (9,3), DOWN to (9,1), or LEFT to (8,2). But the body is at (8,2), so moving LEFT would collide with the body. Therefore, valid moves are UP or DOWN.\n\nWait, I need to correct my previous thought. The snake's current position is (9,2) with the body at (8,2). So the next move can't be LEFT (to (8,2)) because that's the body. So valid moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But RIGHT would take the snake to (10,2), which is outside the 10x10 grid (since x ranges from 0-9). So RIGHT is invalid. Therefore, only UP and DOWN are possible.\n\nSo the options are UP to (9,3) or DOWN to (9,1). The apple at (9,0) is two steps down from (9,2). Moving DOWN twice would reach it. However, moving DOWN now to (9,1) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (9,0) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,3) would take the snake away from the apple but might lead towards other apples. However, the apple at (3,9) is far, and moving up might not be the best strategy. \n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is at (1,4) with body at (2,4). They can't move up into their own body, so their possible moves are left, right, or down. They are not a direct threat to my path towards (9,0).\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (9,1), getting closer to the apple at (9,0). This avoids collision and moves towards the nearest apple efficiently.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"
