This does not encounter a wall or any snake. There are no apples at (6, 5).\n  \n- **DOWN (to 6, 3)**: This moves me to (6, 3). This does not encounter a wall or any snake. There are no apples at (6, 3).\n\n- **LEFT (to 5, 4)**: This moves me to (5, 4). This does not encounter a wall or any snake. There are no apples at (5, 4).\n  \n- **RIGHT (to 7, 4)**: This moves me to (7, 4). This does not encounter a wall or any snake. There are no apples at (7, 4).\n\nHowever, while none of these moves result in immediate points, I need to consider the future moves. \n\n- If I go UP to (6, 5), the next moves after that are also further from any apples.\n- If I go DOWN to (6, 3), there are also no immediate apple opportunities.\n- If I go LEFT to (5, 4), no apples are nearby.\n- If I go RIGHT to (7, 4), I'm still not approaching any immediate apples.\n\nSince one of my goals is to approach the apples, let's see how the apples' positions affect our decision. \n\n**Evaluating Apples**:\n- The closest apple to my current position (6, 4) is (9, 4), where I could move RIGHT and then pursue it directly next turn.\n\nGiven all this, the best immediate move is to **move to the right (7, 4)**, as it keeps me in line to head toward the apple (9, 4) on subsequent turns without hitting a wall or an enemy.\n\nNext move: **RIGHT**."
