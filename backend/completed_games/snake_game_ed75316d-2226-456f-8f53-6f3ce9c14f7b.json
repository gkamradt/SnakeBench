I need to ensure that my movement does not lead me into a wall, into myself, or into an enemy snake.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**: Snake #2 is located at (7, 3) with its body extending down to (7, 2). My main concern is avoiding running into that snake. The snake's body occupies (7, 2), and I cannot move into that space or (7, 3) since it is also occupied by the enemy snake.\n\n3. **Apples to Target**: \n   - There\u2019s an apple at (8, 7), which is directly to the right of my current position (located at (6, 7)).\n   - The apples at (3, 8) and (1, 8) are too far and also complicated due to my body currently being on (6, 7).\n   - The apple at (5, 2) and the enemy snake position at (7, 3) are out of my reach for the next move.\n  \nSince my options are relatively limited by enemy positioning and the need to not collide with myself or walls, and I have a clear path to eat the apple at (8, 7):\n\n- **Next Move Considerations**: The apple at (8, 7) is my best option. It\u2019s one move to the right and will allow me to grow.\n\n- Moving right keeps me from running into any threats and will allow me to maximize my points.\n\nWith all factors considered, my next move is:\n\n**RIGHT**."
