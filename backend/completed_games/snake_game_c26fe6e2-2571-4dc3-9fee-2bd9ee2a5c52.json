            "rationale": "--Your current move information:--\n\nDirection: UP\nRationale: The situation on the board remains favorable for me, as my snake is still relatively close to several apples, while the enemy snake is far away. The apple at (0,9) is just one move away, so I should continue moving in the same upward direction to consume it, which would increase my length and score. Since the enemy snake is still at a safe distance, I do not need to alter my path.\n\nOnce I have consumed the apple at (0,9), my next objective would be to move towards the apple at (2,8). To reach this apple efficiently, I will have to move to the right after eating the apple at my current trajectory. Therefore, for the next few moves, my strategy will be to shift rightwards after moving upwards, unless the enemy snake's position needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nHowever, I must remain cautious about the possibility of the enemy snake moving towards me or the apples, potentially obstructing my captures. While the enemy is in a non-threatening position currently, I should continue checking their movements to ensure my snake's safety.\n\nOverall, given the current board state and my strategy to obtain a higher score by focusing on the nearest apples, I should continue moving my snake upwards.\n\nMy decided next move: UP.\n\n--End of your current move information.--"

Currently, I'm at the top edge of the game board and any further upward movement can lead to a collision with the wall, resulting in a game over. Therefore, the optimal move at this point would be to go right. This move will keep my snake in the top row, and keep it on course towards the next apple. At the same time, the move provides enough space to maneuver and avoid potential obstructions caused by the enemy snake in the future.\n\nMy attention is also on the enemy's position, as the enemy snake is quite away from my snake and any apple on the board. However, in case the enemy snake starts moving upward, we might end up competing for the same apples. Therefore, I will keep an eye on its movements.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the location of the nearest apple to my snake and maintaining distance from the enemy snake, my next move will be to the right. By following the decided strategy, I aim to grow as much as possible and score higher in the game.\n\nMy decided next move: RIGHT.\n\n--End of your current move information.--"
