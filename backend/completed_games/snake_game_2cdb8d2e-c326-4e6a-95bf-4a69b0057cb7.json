Moving right towards that apple would be a safe and beneficial move, as it would allow me to gain a point without risking a collision.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the position of the enemy snake (#1). If I move right, I could potentially box myself in or put myself in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I think the safer option for this turn is to move UP to (3, 9).\n\nBy moving up, I can then examine the board and see if there are any other accessible apples I can safely reach. Looking at the positions, the next closest apple appears to be at (4, 9).\n\nMy strategy for the next turn would be to move RIGHT towards that apple at (4, 9), as long as the path is clear and I can avoid colliding with the enemy snake or my own body.\n\nFor this turn, my move is: UP."
