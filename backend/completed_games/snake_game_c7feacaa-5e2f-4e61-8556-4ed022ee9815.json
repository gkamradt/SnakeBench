However, moving up currently presents no immediate risk of collision unless the enemy snake moves towards me.\n\n2. Moving DOWN (to 2, 7): This takes me further away from nearby apples and doesn't help much in terms of strategic positioning or avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n3. Moving LEFT (to 1, 8): This moves me closer to an apple at (1, 1) eventually but moves directly toward the enemy snake, increasing the risk of being blocked or trapped, especially because the enemy is last seen at (1, 9).\n\n4. Moving RIGHT (to 3, 8): Moves me in line with obtaining the apple at (4, 3) sooner. This direction offers an open path with no immediate threats from walls or the enemy snake.\n\n**Deciding Strategy:**\n\nGiven the apple distribution and positions, my best move for now is to start moving RIGHT, aiming towards the apple at (4,3). This keeps me on a relatively safe path away from the single visible enemy snake while also moving towards an attainable apple.
