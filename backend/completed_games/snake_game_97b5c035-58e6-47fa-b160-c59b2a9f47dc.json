After collecting the apple at (0, 9), I will have to decide my next move based on the updated positions of the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nGiven the current board state and positions of the apples, the best strategy is to collect the apples in a sequence that allows for the shortest path with the least risk of collision. After collecting the apple at (0, 9), I should aim for the apple at (5, 9) next.\n\nTherefore, my next move is UP to start moving towards the apple at (0, 9).\n\nNext move: UP"
