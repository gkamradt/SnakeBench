Currently, no immediate threats are visible.\n2. **Apple Collection:** The closest apples are at (7, 7) and (7, 8), which are 1 and 2 units away respectively. Other apples are further away.\n3. **Avoid Enemy Snake:** The enemy snake is at (7, 2), which is not in my immediate path.\n\n### Plan:\n- **Move UP to (7, 7):** This is a safe move and allows me to collect the apple at (7, 7). From (7, 7), I can then move UP again to (7, 8) to collect the next apple.\n- **Next Turn:** From (7, 8), I can consider moving towards the next closest apple, such as (7, 3) or (2, 2).\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- **Continue Moving UP or LEFT:** Depending on the new positions of the apples and the enemy snake, I will aim to collect more apples while staying safe from any potential threats.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP"
