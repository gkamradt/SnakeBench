The closest apple to our current position is at (0, 4). Since our current position is (1, 4), moving left will take us directly to it.\n\nMoving left is the optimal choice right now as it will gain points from eating the closest apple and move us towards more apples in a potentially safer area of the board.\n\n**Strategy for next turn**: After eating the apple at (0, 4), we should reassess the situation and move towards the next closest apple. We need to keep an eye on the enemy snake and avoid potential collisions.\n\n**Next Move**: LEFT."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,0). That's the bottom row, far right. There are apples at (4,2), (0,4), (4,9), (2,6), and (6,2). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (1,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards. My position at (9,0) is the bottom-right corner.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . A . A . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (4,2): Row 2, Column 4\n\n- (0,4): Row 4, Column 0\n\n- (4,9): Row 9, Column 4\n\n- (2,6): Row 6, Column 2\n\n- (6,2): Row 2, Column 6\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (1,4): Row 4, Column 1\n\nMy snake 2 is at (9,0): Row 0, Column 9\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the closest apple. Let's see the distances:\n\nFrom (9,0) to (4,2): That's a horizontal distance of 9-4=5, vertical distance of 0-2=-2, so total steps would be 5 right and 2 up.\n\nTo (0,4): Horizontal 9-0=9, vertical 0-4=-4, so 9 left and 4 up.\n\nTo (4,9): Horizontal 9-4=5, vertical 0-9=-9, so 5 right and 9 up.\n\nTo (2,6): Horizontal 9-2=7, vertical 0-6=-6, so 7 right and 6 up.\n\nTo (6,2): Horizontal 9-6=3, vertical 0-2=-2, so 3 right and 2 up.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be (4,2), requiring only 5 right and 2 up.\n\nBut I need to consider the path and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's think about moving right first. From (9,0), moving right would take me to (9,1), then (9,2), etc., up to (9,4), which is where one of the apples is at (4,2). Wait, no, apple at (4,2) is row 2, column 4. Wait, there seems to be confusion in the board representation.\n\nWait, in the board description:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: A 1 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . A . A . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apple at (4,2): Row 2, Column 4\n\nApple at (0,4): Row 4, Column 0\n\nApple at (4,9): Row 9, Column 4\n\nApple at (2,6): Row 6, Column 2\n\nApple at (6,2): Row 2, Column 6\n\nMy position: Row 0, Column 9\n\nWait, but in the board description, Row 0 has the snake at column 9.\n\nWait, but in the coordinate system, (9,0) should be Row 9, Column 0, but according to the board description, Row 0 is the bottom row.\n\nI think there's confusion in the coordinate system. In the board description, Row 0 is the bottom row, but in the coordinates, (0,0) is bottom-left, which corresponds to Row 0, Column 0.\n\nWait, in the board description, Row 9 is the top row, Row 0 is the bottom row.\n\nBut in the coordinates, (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n\nSo, coordinates match the row and column numbers.\n\nTherefore, my position at (9,0) is Row 9, Column 0.\n\nWait, but in the board description, Row 0 has the snake at column 9.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an inversion.\n\nWait, perhaps the board is printed with Row 9 at the top and Row 0 at the bottom.\n\nIn that case, my position at (9,0) is Row 9, Column 0, which is the top-left corner.\n\nBut in the board description, it shows Row 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nSo, yes, Row 9 is the top row, Row 0 is the bottom row.\n\nTherefore, my position is Row 9, Column 0, which is the top-left corner.\n\nWait, but in the board description, Row 9 has a dot at column 0, and snake 2 at column 9.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the board description.\n\nWait, looking back, the board description shows:\n\n 9 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 4 A 1 . . . . . . . .\n\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 2 . . . . A . A . . .\n\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 0 . . . . . . . . . 2\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, Row 9: columns 0 to 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nSo, snake 2 is at Row 0, Column 9.\n\nBut earlier it was stated that snake 2 is at (9,0), which should be Row 9, Column 0.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the coordinates are given as (Y,X) instead of (X,Y).\n\nIn standard Cartesian coordinates, (X,Y) with X horizontal and Y vertical.\n\nBut in the board description, rows increase from bottom to top, with Row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, perhaps coordinates are (Y,X), where Y is the row number, X is the column number.\n\nIn that case, (9,0) would be Row 9, Column 0, which is top-left.\n\nBut in the board description, Row 9, Column 0 is dot, and Row 0, Column 9 is snake 2.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the coordinates are (X,Y), with X column, Y row.\n\nIn that case, (9,0) is Column 9, Row 0, which is bottom-right.\n\nBut in the board description, Row 0, Column 9 has snake 2.\n\nWait, but in the board description, Row 9 is at the top, Row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, coordinates are likely (X,Y), with X column, Y row.\n\nTherefore, (9,0) is Column 9, Row 0, which is bottom-right.\n\nBut in the board description, Row 0, Column 9 has snake 2.\n\nOkay, that matches.\n\nSo, position (9,0) is bottom-right.\n\nSimilarly, apple at (4,2) is Column 4, Row 2, which is Row 2, Column 4.\n\nGot it.\n\nNow, I need to plan a path to the apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of all apples and the enemy snake.\n\nApples:\n\n- (4,2)\n\n-"
