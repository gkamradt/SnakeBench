As of now, this snake doesn't pose a direct threat to my immediate actions but I need to be mindful of its movements.\n\n### Analyzing Moves:\n\n- **UP (5, 2):** This move could potentially position me toward the upper apples, but it's not an immediate gain.\n- **LEFT (4, 1):** Taking this move would reverse my previous direction, which isn't beneficial right now.\n- **RIGHT (6, 1):** Progressing right once more keeps my trajectory consistent and brings me closer to the apple at (7, 0), making it a viable direction for near-term advancement.\n- **DOWN (5, 0):** Heading downward moves my y-coordinate closer to the apple at (2, 0), but deviates from the safe path I'm on.\n\n### Plan and Strategy:\n\n1. **Immediate Efficiency:** Continue towards (7, 0) as it presents a good, clear path without immediate danger from the opponent snake.\n2. **Flexibility and Observation:** Maintain awareness of the opponent's moves, as their plans could change at any moment.\n3. **Avoid Risks:** Staying clear of the opponent and potential enclosing walls.\n\n### Decision:\n\nContinuing **RIGHT** keeps me in a favorable position, aligns well towards the apple at (7, 0), and avoids unnecessary complications.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"
