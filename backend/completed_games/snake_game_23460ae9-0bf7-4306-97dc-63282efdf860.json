Going for that apple would also move me further away from the enemy snake #2 at (9, 7).\n\nAfter eating the (5, 4) apple, I should target the (6, 3) apple next, while continuing to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the (6, 3) apple, I should go for the (3, 8) apple, while still avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nMy decided next move: RIGHT"

Moving up towards this apple is a good strategy.\n- **Avoid Enemy Snake:** The enemy snake is at (3, 2), which is not immediately threatening, but it's good to keep an eye on its movements.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the nearest apple is at (5, 4), moving up towards this apple is the best immediate move. Moving up from (9, 7) will take us to (9, 6), which is still on the path towards the apple at (5, 4).\n\n### Next Turn Strategy:\n- **Continue Towards the Apple:** After reaching (9, 6), continue moving up towards (9, 5), then (9, 4), and finally (8, 4) and (7, 4) to get closer to the apple at (5, 4).\n- **Monitor Enemy Snake:** Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to avoid any potential threats.\n\n**Next Move:** UP\n\nUP"
