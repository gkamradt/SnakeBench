However, I should be cautious about moving down to eat the apple at (5, 0) as the enemy snake might also target that apple.\n\nMy strategy for now is to focus on eating the apples and growing my snake while avoiding collisions with the enemy snake, walls, and myself. I'll prioritize the apples that are closer to me and in a safe position.\n\nGiven the current situation, the best move is to go DOWN and eat the apple at (5, 0). This will allow me to grow and gain a point while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nNext turn, I should consider moving towards the apple at (4, 8) or (5, 9), depending on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nDOWN"

There are several apples on the board, including one right next to me at (5, 0). The enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (5, 1), with no body segments.\n\nSince I'm positioned right next to an apple, my best move would be to go RIGHT to collect that apple and gain a point. This will also put some distance between me and the enemy snake.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious as there are other apples positioned in the upper part of the board, and I don't want to get too far away from them. My long-term strategy should be to try and collect as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions with walls or other snakes.\n\nMy next move is: RIGHT."
