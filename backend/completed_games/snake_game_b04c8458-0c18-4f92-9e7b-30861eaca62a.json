Our snake\u2019s head (#1) is at (1,5) and our body extends upward at (1,6), so we can\u2019t go UP (that would be reversing into our own body). The closest apple is at (4,3) \u2013 it requires moving +3 in x and \u20132 in y from our current head. Our available moves (without going left, which moves away from that apple) are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf we go DOWN, our head moves to (1,4). That does reduce the y distance and gives a Manhattan distance from (1,4) to (4,3) of 3 + 1 = 4 moves. However, note that enemy snake #2 is currently at (1,3). Moving directly down brings us closer to that enemy head, so we may risk ending up in its immediate zone.\n\nBy moving RIGHT, our head goes to (2,5), which is equally good in terms of Manhattan distance (distance from (2,5) to (4,3) is |4\u20132| + |3\u20135| = 2 + 2 = 4). Moreover, it nudges us toward the larger x value we need while keeping our distance from the enemy snake. In subsequent turns we could plan a route such as going RIGHT again and then DOWN appropriately to reach apple (4,3) without stepping too close to enemy snake #2 at (1,3).\n\nBased on safety and goal progression, our best move is to steer RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
