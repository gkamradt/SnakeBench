This apple is relatively isolated, and moving towards it will keep me at a safe distance from Snake #1. Additionally, moving towards (2, 5) will set me up for a potential collection of the apple at (1, 2) after that, as it is on the way to the bottom left corner of the board where there are no enemy snakes.\n\nTo start this maneuver, I should move LEFT to (8, 2), which is away from the enemy snake and towards the middle of the board, giving me more options for subsequent moves. This direction also avoids moving towards the walls or the enemy snake's body, reducing the risk of an immediate collision.\n\nAfter moving left, my strategy for the subsequent turn will be to continue moving towards the apple at (2, 5) while keeping an eye on Snake #1's movements.
