Moving right towards the apple at (4, 9) or (4, 2) seems practical as they're away from Snake #1's path and closer to the apples available for consumption if Snake #1 doesn't change course.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful that Snake #1 doesn't move down obstructing the right path.\n\nTargeting the apple at (4, 2), the best initial route seems a narrow path to the right first to (6, 5) then reassess the potential threats (e.g., if Snake #1 moves down).\n\nStrategy: Move towards eating the apple at (4, 2) while remaining alert to Snake #1's movements. Next, I will aim right to position myself accordingly and eat the apple for growth, while being ready to pivot the strategy based on Snake #1's actions.\n\nRationale for next move: I am positioned at (6, 6).

Moving directly towards (8, 8) apple seems pragmatic as I am currently adjacent to it, so it provides me an increment in points without crossing through congested spaces.\n\n*Need more depth before continuing. Trust the immediate barriers might be less trouble before potential chokes by snakes' movements.*\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nIf\u72b6\u51b5\u4ef6\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u9762\u4e34\u963b\u6321\u60c5\u666f, maybe \u5e26\u7740\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e29\u67d4\u7684\u9884\u9009, I'll approach again with any obstacles overcome beforehand."
