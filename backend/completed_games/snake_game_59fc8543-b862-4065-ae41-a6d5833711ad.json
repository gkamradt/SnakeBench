However, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's potential movement and avoid getting trapped or cornered. A safe approach would be to move down towards the bottom of the board, which will keep me away from the enemy snake for now and allow me to approach the apple from a safer position.\n\nRationale:\nMoving towards the bottom of the board will create some distance between me and the enemy snake, reducing the risk of immediate confrontation.
