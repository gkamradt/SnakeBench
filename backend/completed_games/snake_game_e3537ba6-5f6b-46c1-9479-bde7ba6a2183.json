Apples still on the board are at: \n   - (9, 3) \n   - (2, 6) \n   - (3, 1) (which I can pick up next)\n   - (2, 9) \n   - (2, 0)\n\n2. My primary target in the next move is to collect the apple at (3, 1) after just having moved to (7, 1). \n\n3. Checking my surroundings, I have:\n   - The option to move UP to (7, 2) (my last position).\n   - The option to move DOWN to (7, 0) which would be safe (but further from the apple).\n   - The option to move LEFT to (6, 1) (safe) or \n   - The option to move RIGHT to (8, 1) (also safe).\n\nHowever, my immediate goal is to pick the apple at (3, 1), which lies directly below me if I go DOWN to (7, 0). In fact, the apple at (3, 1) would then become my focus in the subsequent round after reaching (7, 1).\n\n**Strategy Moving Forward:**\n1. I will prioritize collecting apples efficiently that maximizes my growth while ensuring I avoid running into the enemy snake's potential future positions or running into walls.\n2. Always calculate the best path towards the next nearest apple with minimal risk from enemy interactions.\n\nHence, to ensure I can access that apple in the following move, I\u2019ll need to go DOWN.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."
