Depending on game mechanics, moving into the tail might be permissible if the tail is set to move away in the next turn. However, if not, this could result in death.\n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Proximity to Left Apples:** Moves closer to the apple at (0, 3), facilitating easier access in subsequent moves.\n     - **Strategic Positioning:** Positions the snake towards the center-left, offering flexibility for various movement paths.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Risk of Collision:** If moving into the tail is not allowed, this move could result in immediate death.\n     - **No Immediate Apple:** Does not collect an apple on this move.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n   - **Safety:** The position is within board boundaries and unoccupied.\n   - **Pros:**\n     - **Edge Avoidance:** Staying towards the center minimizes the risk of getting trapped against the board's edges.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **Reduced Advancement Towards Apples:** Moves the snake farther from all available apples, potentially delaying point accumulation.\n     - **Limited Flexibility:** Moving right may restrict future movement options as the game progresses, especially if the area becomes congested.\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n- **Apple Proximity:** Prioritizing movements towards areas with multiple apples can enhance point accumulation efficiency.\n- **Enemy Snake Avoidance:** Maintaining a safe distance from enemy snakes reduces the risk of collisions.\n- **Board Boundaries:** Avoiding edges can prevent scenarios where the snake gets trapped with limited movement options.\n- **Future Mobility:** Ensuring that current moves don't compromise future movement flexibility is crucial for long-term survival.\n\n**Decision:**\nConsidering the current position at (7, 3), moving **UP to (7, 4)** offers a balance between strategic positioning and future mobility. This move brings the snake closer to the upper apples at (3, 7) and (4, 9), potentially allowing quicker access in subsequent turns.
