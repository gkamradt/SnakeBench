To reach this apple, I need to navigate down and to the right while being cautious of the enemy snake's movements and avoiding any potential traps.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (5, 2) with its body at [(6, 2), (6, 1)], which means it could potentially move up or to the left. I must be mindful of its possible movements and ensure that I don't get cornered or trapped.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nMy current plan is to move RIGHT to (3, 8) and then start moving DOWN towards the apple at (4, 4). However, I will closely monitor the enemy snake's movements and adjust my path if necessary. If the enemy snake moves in a way that threatens my path to the apple, I will prioritize my survival and look for alternative routes or opportunities to outmaneuver it.\n\nAs I make my way towards the apple at (4, 4), I will also keep an eye on the other apples on the board, especially the one at (3, 2), which could be a good target after collecting the one at (4, 4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

This means that it has not moved since my last turn, which could indicate that it is waiting for an opportunity to cut me off or force me into a corner.\n\nTo reach the apple at (4, 4), I have two main options:\n1. Continue moving DOWN and then RIGHT, hoping that the enemy snake does not block my path.\n2. Move LEFT and then DOWN, taking a slightly longer route but potentially avoiding a direct confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nConsidering the enemy snake's position, I believe that moving LEFT and then DOWN might be the safer option. This will allow me to maintain some distance from the enemy snake while still progressing towards the apple at (4, 4). If the enemy snake moves in a way that threatens my new path, I will reassess my strategy and consider alternative routes.\n\nAs I make my way towards the apple at (4, 4), I will continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements and the overall board state, looking for opportunities to collect apples and outmaneuver my opponent.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
