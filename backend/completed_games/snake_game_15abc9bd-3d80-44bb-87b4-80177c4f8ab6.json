            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 grid game. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules clearly.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (6,5), which is somewhere in the middle of the grid. The apples are at positions (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize my points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself (like moving backwards), I die.\n3. The objective is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next move carefully. Let me visualize the board based on the given state.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the snake is at (6,5). The apples are at (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). I should check which of these are reachable from my current position without dying.\n\nFirst, I need to see if moving to any of these apples is possible. Let's list the possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- Moving up: (5,5)\n- Moving down: (7,5)\n- Moving left: (6,4)\n- Moving right: (6,6)\n\nNow, I need to check if these positions are within the board's boundaries. All of them are between 0 and 9, so that's fine.\n\nNext, I need to see if moving into any of these positions would cause me to die. The rules say that if I move onto an apple, I gain a point, but if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any walls or other snakes in the given state. So, moving into any of these positions is safe. However, I should consider the direction of movement and whether it's better to go towards the apples or avoid getting stuck.\n\nLet me list the possible moves and their outcomes:\n\n1. Moving up to (5,5): This is a safe move, but I don't know if it's an apple. It's not, so I gain a point.\n2. Moving down to (7,5): This is an apple. I gain a point.\n3. Moving left to (6,4): Not an apple, safe.\n4. Moving right to (6,6): Not an apple, safe.\n\nSo, moving down to (7,5) would give me an immediate point. But I should also consider if there's a better move or if I should avoid it to get more points.\n\nWait, but moving down to (7,5) is an apple, so I gain a point. Alternatively, moving up or left or right would give me points but also risk moving into a wall or another snake, which would kill me.\n\nBut in this case, moving down is the only safe move that gives me a point. So, I should prioritize moving down to (7,5) to gain the point.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the snake's movement. Since the snake is at (6,5), moving down to (7,5) would make it longer, but that's fine as long as it doesn't collide with itself or other snakes.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is at [], meaning it's empty. So, moving down to (7,5) would make the snake's body from (6,5) to (7,5), which is a 2-cell snake. That's acceptable.\n\nBut I should also consider if moving down is the best option. Alternatively, moving up to (5,5) would give me a point but might lead to a longer snake, which could be risky if the snake's body blocks other paths.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (6,5), moving down is the only safe move that gives me a point. So, I should go down to (7,5).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the board state. The board shows that (7,5) is empty, so moving there is safe. The apples at (7,7) and (9,8) are not reachable from (6,5) in one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (5,5), I gain a point but might not get any more. Moving left or right would give me points but also risk moving into walls or other snakes.\n\nBut since moving down is the only safe move that gives a point, I should go with that.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is diagonally adjacent. From (6,5), moving right twice would get me to (6,7), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving right to (6,6) and then down to (7,6), which is an apple. But that would require two moves, which might not be optimal.\n\nBut in the current state, I can only make one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, moving to (7,5) and then to (7,6) would require two moves, but that's not possible in one turn. So, I should stick to one move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, if I move down to (7,5), then right to (7,6), but that would require two moves, which is not possible in one turn. So, I should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the only safe immediate move is down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nSo, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nThe best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\n**Answer:** DOWN"

The apples at (7,7) and (9,8) are not reachable from (6,5) in one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (5,5), I gain a point but might not get any more. Moving left or right would give me points but also risk moving into walls or other snakes.\n\nBut since moving down is the only safe move that gives a point, I should go with that.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is diagonally adjacent. From (6,5), moving right twice would get me to (6,7), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving right to (6,6) and then down to (7,6), which is an apple. But that would require two moves, which might not be optimal.\n\nBut in the current state, I can only make one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, moving to (7,5) and then to (7,6) would require two moves, but that's not possible in one turn. So, I should stick to one move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, if I move down to (7,5), then right to (7,6), but that would require two moves, which is not possible in one turn.

Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules clearly.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (6,5), which is somewhere in the middle of the grid. The apples are at positions (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize my points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself (like moving backwards), I die.\n3. The objective is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next move carefully. Let me visualize the board based on the given state.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the snake is at (6,5). The apples are at (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). I should check which of these are reachable from my current position without dying.\n\nFirst, I need to see if moving to any of these apples is possible. Let's list the possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- Moving up: (5,5)\n- Moving down: (7,5)\n- Moving left: (6,4)\n- Moving right: (6,6)\n\nNow, I need to check if these positions are within the board's boundaries. All of them are between 0 and 9, so that's fine.\n\nNext, I need to see if moving into any of these positions would cause me to die. The rules say that if I move onto an apple, I gain a point, but if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any walls or other snakes in the given state. So, moving into any of these positions is safe.

Moving left to (6,4): Not an apple, safe.\n4. Moving right to (6,6): Not an apple, safe.\n\nSo, moving down to (7,5) would give me an immediate point. But I should also consider if there's a better move or if I should avoid it to get more points.\n\nWait, but moving down to (7,5) is an apple, so I gain a point.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 grid game. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules clearly.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (6,5), which is somewhere in the middle of the grid. The apples are at positions (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize my points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself (like moving backwards), I die.\n3. The objective is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next move carefully. Let me visualize the board based on the given state.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the snake is at (6,5). The apples are at (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). I should check which of these are reachable from my current position without dying.\n\nFirst, I need to see if moving to any of these apples is possible. Let's list the possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- Moving up: (5,5)\n- Moving down: (7,5)\n- Moving left: (6,4)\n- Moving right: (6,6)\n\nNow, I need to check if these positions are within the board's boundaries. All of them are between 0 and 9, so that's fine.\n\nNext, I need to see if moving into any of these positions would cause me to die. The rules say that if I move onto an apple, I gain a point, but if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any walls or other snakes in the given state. So, moving into any of these positions is safe. However, I should consider the direction of movement and whether it's better to go towards the apples or avoid getting stuck.\n\nLet me list the possible moves and their outcomes:\n\n1. Moving up to (5,5): This is a safe move, but I don't know if it's an apple. It's not, so I gain a point.\n2. Moving down to (7,5): This is an apple. I gain a point.\n3. Moving left to (6,4): Not an apple, safe.\n4. Moving right to (6,6): Not an apple, safe.\n\nSo, moving down to (7,5) would give me an immediate point. But I should also consider if there's a better move or if I should avoid it to get more points.\n\nWait, but moving down to (7,5) is an apple, so I gain a point. Alternatively, moving up or left or right would give me points but also risk moving into a wall or another snake, which would kill me.\n\nBut in this case, moving down is the only safe move that gives me a point. So, I should prioritize moving down to (7,5) to gain the point.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the snake's movement. Since the snake is at (6,5), moving down to (7,5) would make it longer, but that's fine as long as it doesn't collide with itself or other snakes.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is at [], meaning it's empty. So, moving down to (7,5) would make the snake's body from (6,5) to (7,5), which is a 2-cell snake. That's acceptable.\n\nBut I should also consider if moving down is the best option. Alternatively, moving up to (5,5) would give me a point but might lead to a longer snake, which could be risky if the snake's body blocks other paths.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (6,5), moving down is the only safe move that gives me a point. So, I should go down to (7,5).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the board state. The board shows that (7,5) is empty, so moving there is safe. The apples at (7,7) and (9,8) are not reachable from (6,5) in one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (5,5), I gain a point but might not get any more. Moving left or right would give me points but also risk moving into walls or other snakes.\n\nBut since moving down is the only safe move that gives a point, I should go with that.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is diagonally adjacent. From (6,5), moving right twice would get me to (6,7), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving right to (6,6) and then down to (7,6), which is an apple. But that would require two moves, which might not be optimal.\n\nBut in the current state, I can only make one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, moving to (7,5) and then to (7,6) would require two moves, but that's not possible in one turn. So, I should stick to one move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, if I move down to (7,5), then right to (7,6), but that would require two moves, which is not possible in one turn. So, I should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the only safe immediate move is down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nSo, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nThe best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\n**Answer:** DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 grid game. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules clearly.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (6,5), which is somewhere in the middle of the grid. The apples are at positions (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize my points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself (like moving backwards), I die.\n3. The objective is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next move carefully. Let me visualize the board based on the given state.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the snake is at (6,5). The apples are at (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). I should check which of these are reachable from my current position without dying.\n\nFirst, I need to see if moving to any of these apples is possible. Let's list the possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- Moving up: (5,5)\n- Moving down: (7,5)\n- Moving left: (6,4)\n- Moving right: (6,6)\n\nNow, I need to check if these positions are within the board's boundaries. All of them are between 0 and 9, so that's fine.\n\nNext, I need to see if moving into any of these positions would cause me to die. The rules say that if I move onto an apple, I gain a point, but if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any walls or other snakes in the given state. So, moving into any of these positions is safe. However, I should consider the direction of movement and whether it's better to go towards the apples or avoid getting stuck.\n\nLet me list the possible moves and their outcomes:\n\n1. Moving up to (5,5): This is a safe move, but I don't know if it's an apple. It's not, so I gain a point.\n2. Moving down to (7,5): This is an apple. I gain a point.\n3. Moving left to (6,4): Not an apple, safe.\n4. Moving right to (6,6): Not an apple, safe.\n\nSo, moving down to (7,5) would give me an immediate point. But I should also consider if there's a better move or if I should avoid it to get more points.\n\nWait, but moving down to (7,5) is an apple, so I gain a point. Alternatively, moving up or left or right would give me points but also risk moving into a wall or another snake, which would kill me.\n\nBut in this case, moving down is the only safe move that gives me a point. So, I should prioritize moving down to (7,5) to gain the point.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the snake's movement. Since the snake is at (6,5), moving down to (7,5) would make it longer, but that's fine as long as it doesn't collide with itself or other snakes.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is at [], meaning it's empty. So, moving down to (7,5) would make the snake's body from (6,5) to (7,5), which is a 2-cell snake. That's acceptable.\n\nBut I should also consider if moving down is the best option. Alternatively, moving up to (5,5) would give me a point but might lead to a longer snake, which could be risky if the snake's body blocks other paths.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (6,5), moving down is the only safe move that gives me a point. So, I should go down to (7,5).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the board state. The board shows that (7,5) is empty, so moving there is safe. The apples at (7,7) and (9,8) are not reachable from (6,5) in one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (5,5), I gain a point but might not get any more. Moving left or right would give me points but also risk moving into walls or other snakes.\n\nBut since moving down is the only safe move that gives a point, I should go with that.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is diagonally adjacent. From (6,5), moving right twice would get me to (6,7), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving right to (6,6) and then down to (7,6), which is an apple. But that would require two moves, which might not be optimal.\n\nBut in the current state, I can only make one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, moving to (7,5) and then to (7,6) would require two moves, but that's not possible in one turn. So, I should stick to one move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, if I move down to (7,5), then right to (7,6), but that would require two moves, which is not possible in one turn. So, I should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the only safe immediate move is down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nSo, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nThe best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\n**Answer:** DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 grid game. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules clearly.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (6,5), which is somewhere in the middle of the grid. The apples are at positions (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize my points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself (like moving backwards), I die.\n3. The objective is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, I need to plan my next move carefully. Let me visualize the board based on the given state.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the snake is at (6,5). The apples are at (7,2), (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), and (7,6). I should check which of these are reachable from my current position without dying.\n\nFirst, I need to see if moving to any of these apples is possible. Let's list the possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- Moving up: (5,5)\n- Moving down: (7,5)\n- Moving left: (6,4)\n- Moving right: (6,6)\n\nNow, I need to check if these positions are within the board's boundaries. All of them are between 0 and 9, so that's fine.\n\nNext, I need to see if moving into any of these positions would cause me to die. The rules say that if I move onto an apple, I gain a point, but if I move into a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nLooking at the board, I don't see any walls or other snakes in the given state. So, moving into any of these positions is safe. However, I should consider the direction of movement and whether it's better to go towards the apples or avoid getting stuck.\n\nLet me list the possible moves and their outcomes:\n\n1. Moving up to (5,5): This is a safe move, but I don't know if it's an apple. It's not, so I gain a point.\n2. Moving down to (7,5): This is an apple. I gain a point.\n3. Moving left to (6,4): Not an apple, safe.\n4. Moving right to (6,6): Not an apple, safe.\n\nSo, moving down to (7,5) would give me an immediate point. But I should also consider if there's a better move or if I should avoid it to get more points.\n\nWait, but moving down to (7,5) is an apple, so I gain a point. Alternatively, moving up or left or right would give me points but also risk moving into a wall or another snake, which would kill me.\n\nBut in this case, moving down is the only safe move that gives me a point. So, I should prioritize moving down to (7,5) to gain the point.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the snake's movement. Since the snake is at (6,5), moving down to (7,5) would make it longer, but that's fine as long as it doesn't collide with itself or other snakes.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is at [], meaning it's empty. So, moving down to (7,5) would make the snake's body from (6,5) to (7,5), which is a 2-cell snake. That's acceptable.\n\nBut I should also consider if moving down is the best option. Alternatively, moving up to (5,5) would give me a point but might lead to a longer snake, which could be risky if the snake's body blocks other paths.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (6,5), moving down is the only safe move that gives me a point. So, I should go down to (7,5).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the board state. The board shows that (7,5) is empty, so moving there is safe. The apples at (7,7) and (9,8) are not reachable from (6,5) in one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (5,5), I gain a point but might not get any more. Moving left or right would give me points but also risk moving into walls or other snakes.\n\nBut since moving down is the only safe move that gives a point, I should go with that.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is diagonally adjacent. From (6,5), moving right twice would get me to (6,7), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving right to (6,6) and then down to (7,6), which is an apple. But that would require two moves, which might not be optimal.\n\nBut in the current state, I can only make one move. So, moving down to (7,5) is the best immediate move.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, moving to (7,5) and then to (7,6) would require two moves, but that's not possible in one turn. So, I should stick to one move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (7,7) is two cells away. So, if I move down to (7,5), then right to (7,6), but that would require two moves, which is not possible in one turn. So, I should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the only safe immediate move is down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\nSo, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nThe best move is to move down to (7,5), gaining a point.\n\n**Answer:** DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.\n\nFirst, the board is set up with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake ID is 2, and it's currently at position (7,4). The apples are located at (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), (7,6), and (5,4). \n\nI remember that when moving onto an apple, the snake grows and gains a point. So, I need to check if moving in any of the four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) from my current position (7,4) will land me on an apple.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The board is represented as a grid where each row is a horizontal line. The first number in each row is the row number, with 0 being the bottom row and 9 being the top row. So, row 0 is the bottom, row 1 is above it, and so on.\n\nLooking at the board state provided, I can see the positions of the apples. The apples are at (3,5), (7,7), (9,8), (7,6), and (5,4). \n\nMy current position is (7,4). Let's see where each apple is relative to me. \n\n- Apple at (3,5): To get there from (7,4), I would need to move left twice and up once. That's not a straight direction.\n- Apple at (7,7): To get there, I need to move up three times. That's a straight direction.\n- Apple at (9,8): To get there, I need to move right twice and up once. Not a straight direction.\n- Apple at (7,6): To get there, I need to move left once and down twice. Not a straight direction.\n- Apple at (5,4): To get there, I need to move left three times. That's a straight direction.\n\nSo, the apples at (7,7) and (5,4) are in straight directions from my current position. The apple at (9,8) is not in a straight line, so I can't reach it in one move.\n\nNow, I need to consider the rules. If I move onto an apple, I gain a point. If I move into a wall, snake, or myself, I die. So, I need to make sure my next move doesn't take me into a wall or myself.\n\nLooking at my current position (7,4), I can move in four directions:\n\n1. **UP**: From (7,4), moving up would take me to (6,4). Is that a wall? Looking at the board, row 6 is \"4 . . . . . A 2 . . .\", so (6,4) is a dot, not a wall. So, moving UP is possible.\n\n2. **DOWN**: From (7,4), moving down would take me to (8,4). Looking at row 8, it's \"1 . . . . . . . . .\", so (8,4) is a dot. So, moving DOWN is possible.\n\n3. **LEFT**: From (7,4), moving left would take me to (7,3). Looking at row 7, it's \"2 . . . . . . . . .\", so (7,3) is a dot. So, moving LEFT is possible.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: From (7,4), moving right would take me to (7,5). Looking at row 7, it's \"2 . . . . . . . . .\", so (7,5) is a dot. So, moving RIGHT is possible.\n\nNow, I need to check if moving in any of these directions will land me on an apple. \n\n- Moving UP to (6,4): Is there an apple at (6,4)? Looking at the board, row 6 is \"4 . . . . . A 2 . . .\", so (6,4) is a dot. No apple there.\n- Moving DOWN to (8,4): Is there an apple at (8,4)? Row 8 is \"1 . . . . . . . . .\", so (8,4) is a dot. No apple there.\n- Moving LEFT to (7,3): Is there an apple at (7,3)? Row 7 is \"2 . . . . . . . . .\", so (7,3) is a dot. No apple there.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,5): Is there an apple at (7,5)? Row 7 is \"2 . . . . . . . . .\", so (7,5) is a dot. No apple there.\n\nSo, none of the straight directions from my current position land me on an apple. That means I can't gain any points by moving in any of these directions. \n\nHowever, I need to make sure that moving in any of these directions doesn't take me into a wall or myself. From my current position (7,4), moving in any direction leads to a dot, not a wall or myself. So, I can safely move in any of the four directions.\n\nBut since I can't gain any points, I need to choose the direction that allows me to survive the longest. Since all directions are safe, I can choose any direction. But perhaps I should consider the direction that leads me towards the most apples in the future, but since I can't reach any apples in the next move, it doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the direction that leads me to the highest row or column, but that's not specified. Since all directions are safe, I can choose any.\n\nBut perhaps the strategy is to move in a direction that leads me towards the highest row or column, but again, not specified. Alternatively, maybe I should move in a direction that leads me to the highest row, which is row 9, but I'm at row 7, so moving UP three times would take me to row 10, which is beyond the board. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN three times would take me to row 10, which is also beyond the board. So, that's not possible either.\n\nSo, the best I can do is move in a direction that doesn't take me out of the board. Since all four directions are safe, I can choose any.\n\nBut perhaps the strategy is to move in a direction that leads me to the highest row or column, but since I can't reach any apples, it doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move in a direction that leads me to the highest row, which is row 9, but I'm at row 7, so moving UP three times would take me to row 10, which is beyond the board.
