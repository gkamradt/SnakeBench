            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

The apples are still at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with an empty body. Wait, in the previous state, the enemy was at (3,7), but now they're at (3,6). So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. But the enemy is at (3,6), which is two rows below (3,8). If they move up, they could reach (3,7) or (3,8), but that's speculative. However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer. Each step right brings me closer to the apple without immediate threats. The enemy is moving away from my current path. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (4,9). Continue this strategy unless obstacles arise. \n\nDirection: RIGHT\n</think>\n\nTo continue towards the apple at (9,9), I'll move RIGHT again. The path remains clear, and the enemy snake is moving away from my route. \n\nStrategy next turn: Keep moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while monitoring enemy positions.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

The enemy snake #1 is at (3,5) with no body. The board shows that the apple at (9,9) is still there.\n\nFrom (4,9), possible moves are LEFT to (3,9), RIGHT to (5,9), or DOWN to (4,8). UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. Also, moving down would take me away from the current apple. Since I'm already on row 9, staying there to reach (9,9) is more efficient.\n\nLEFT to (3,9) would be moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So the best move is RIGHT again. \n\nI should continue moving RIGHT until I reach (9,9). No immediate threats detected. Next turn, if I'm at (5,9), the same logic applies: keep moving right. The strategy remains consistent.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the apple at (9,9) efficiently, I'll continue moving RIGHT along the top row. The path is clear, and the enemy poses no immediate threat here. \n\n**Next move:** RIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps.

But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it.

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present.

The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

The enemy snake is at (3,3), which is far away and not in the way. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is just three steps away if I keep moving RIGHT. Since there's no immediate threat, continuing towards the closest apple is efficient. \n\nLEFT would take me back to (5,9), which is the previous position. That's not helpful unless avoiding something, but there's no danger there. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Need to make sure that the path remains clear. Since the enemy snake is at (3,3), they might be moving towards other apples, but they're not near my current path. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (9,9), the snake will grow, so the next moves need to avoid colliding with the new body segment. But for now, the priority is to reach the apple safely. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to continue towards (9,9).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. But the enemy is at (3,6), which is two rows below (3,8). If they move up, they could reach (3,7) or (3,8), but that's speculative. However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. Also, moving down would take me away from the current apple.

The other positions on row 9 (from x=5 to x=9) are empty except for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away and not in the path. Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat.

Since the board is 10x10, (9,9) is the maximum coordinate. No risk of going out of bounds when moving to (9,9).\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to continue the path towards the apple at (9,9).\n</think>\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT  \n**Strategy:** Continue moving RIGHT along the top row to efficiently reach the apple at (9,9).

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

The other positions on row 9 (from x=5 to x=9) are empty except for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away and not in the path. Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (9,9) with the body part at (8,9). So the head is at (9,9), and the tail is at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer.

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step.

The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat.

The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear.

Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (9,8) with the body at [(9,9)]. So the head is at (9,8), and the tail is at (9,9). The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The available apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), and (4,1). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear.

The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (9,8) with the body at [(9,9)]. So the head is at (9,8), and the tail is at (9,9). The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The available apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), and (4,1). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Then the next move from (7,7) would need to avoid going back to (8,7) unless there's a path. But for now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nCheck for safety: Moving LEFT to (7,7) is valid. No enemy snakes there. The enemy snake is at (5,1), far away. So no collision risk. The apple is present. So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple. Since the apple at (7,7) is adjacent, it's better to take it now.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step.

Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9).

So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (9,8) with the body at [(9,9)]. So the head is at (9,8), and the tail is at (9,9). The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn.

Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

The apples are still at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with an empty body. Wait, in the previous state, the enemy was at (3,7), but now they're at (3,6). So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple.

The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

This gets me an apple!\n* **RIGHT:** Moves to (6, 1). This takes me further from (4,1).\n\nMoving LEFT gets me the closest apple.  The enemy snake is at (8,7) and moving left doesn't bring me closer to it.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Prioritize apples closest to my head, avoiding self-collision and enemy snakes. If multiple apples are equidistant, choose the one that minimizes the risk of collision.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Wait, the user's last move information says that after moving DOWN, the snake's position is (8,7), and the body is [(8,8), (9,8)]. So the head is now at (8,7), and the body segments are at (8,8) and (9,8). The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), (4,1), (4,4). The enemy snake is at (5,1) with body at [(5,0)].\n\nSo the current board state after the last move: The snake's head is at (8,7), and the body is [(8,8), (9,8)]. The apples are as listed. The enemy snake is at (5,1).\n\nPossible moves from (8,7):\n\nUP: (8,8) \u2013 but that's part of the snake's body. So moving UP would collide with itself. That's a death, so UP is invalid.\n\nDOWN: (8,6). That's empty. Safe, but not an apple.\n\nLEFT: (7,7). There's an apple at (7,7). So moving LEFT would get the apple, grow by 1, and the body would extend. That's a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,7). Check the board. The board's right edge is x=9. So (9,7) is valid. Is there anything there? Looking at the board state provided earlier, row 7 (y=7) at x=9 is part of the snake's body? Wait, the initial board had at row 7: \". . . . . . . A 2 .\" So (8,7) was the head (snake 2), and (9,7) was part of the body? Wait, no. Wait, the initial board state was before the last move. After moving DOWN to (8,7), the body is [(8,8), (9,8)]. So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there. So moving RIGHT is safe but doesn't gain a point.\n\nSo the options are LEFT (to (7,7) for the apple), DOWN (to (8,6)), or RIGHT (to (9,7)). UP is invalid.\n\nThe best move is LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That would add the apple, grow the snake, and the next body segments would be [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. Then the next move from (7,7) would need to avoid going back to (8,7) unless there's a path. But for now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nCheck for safety: Moving LEFT to (7,7) is valid. No enemy snakes there. The enemy snake is at (5,1), far away. So no collision risk. The apple is present. So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple. Since the apple at (7,7) is adjacent, it's better to take it now.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (7,7) with the body segments at [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So (7,8) is empty. So from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8) is safe. Then continue right towards (9,4). But that's a longer path. Maybe not the best option.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. So moving LEFT to (5,7) is a good step. Let's check if that's safe. Yes, (5,7) is empty. Then next move would be DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That path seems viable.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) and then LEFT towards (5,6) and (5,5). Which path is shorter? Both take two moves after the first step. But moving LEFT first might be better as it's a direct approach.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,2). They might be heading towards (4,4) or (2,2). But their current position is (4,2), body at (4,1) and (5,1). So they might be moving up or left. Not sure, but their path doesn't interfere with mine immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,7), getting closer to (5,5). That's the most efficient path to an apple.

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

The apples are still at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with an empty body. Wait, in the previous state, the enemy was at (3,7), but now they're at (3,6). So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. But the enemy is at (3,6), which is two rows below (3,8). If they move up, they could reach (3,7) or (3,8), but that's speculative. However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer. Each step right brings me closer to the apple without immediate threats. The enemy is moving away from my current path. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (4,9).

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The available apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), and (4,1). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there.

No enemy snakes there. The enemy snake is at (5,1), far away. So no collision risk. The apple is present. So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple. Since the apple at (7,7) is adjacent, it's better to take it now.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake is at (4,2) with body [(4,1), (5,1)].\n\nFirst, possible moves from (6,7):\n\n- UP: (6,8). Check if that's safe. The current body parts are [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. (6,8) isn't part of the body. No apple there. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (6,6). Empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (5,7). Check if occupied. The enemy snake is at (4,2), so (5,7) is clear. Also, no body parts here. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (7,7). That's part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide. Invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? The closest apples are (5,5) and (4,4). Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,7), moving LEFT to (5,7) would be a step towards (5,5). Then from (5,7), moving DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's two more moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,6) then LEFT to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,8) might allow heading towards the right-side apples, but those are further away. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are on the right edge, but moving right from (6,8) would require passing through (7,8), which is not part of the body now. Wait, the body is [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. So (7,8) is empty. So from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8) is safe. Then continue right towards (9,4). But that's a longer path. Maybe not the best option.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. So moving LEFT to (5,7) is a good step. Let's check if that's safe. Yes, (5,7) is empty. Then next move would be DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That path seems viable.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) and then LEFT towards (5,6) and (5,5). Which path is shorter? Both take two moves after the first step. But moving LEFT first might be better as it's a direct approach.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,2). They might be heading towards (4,4) or (2,2). But their current position is (4,2), body at (4,1) and (5,1). So they might be moving up or left. Not sure, but their path doesn't interfere with mine immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,7), getting closer to (5,5). That's the most efficient path to an apple. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,3) with body parts at [(4,2), (4,1)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,7). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,8). Check if this is safe. The current body segments are [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7)], so (5,8) isn't part of the body. The board shows no obstacles here. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,6). This position is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,7). Check for collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. No body parts here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,7). That's part of my own body (the first segment). Collision risk. Not safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNext, consider the closest apples. The apple at (5,5) is two moves away if I go DOWN then LEFT. The apple at (4,4) is also nearby. Let's plan a path:\n\n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: From there, moving DOWN to (4,6) and then LEFT to (4,5) would approach (4,4). Alternatively, moving DOWN directly towards (5,5) might be faster.\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Then LEFT to (5,5) would get the apple in two moves. This seems efficient.\n- **UP to (5,8)**: This might lead towards the apples on the right edge (9,4 or 9,2), but that's a longer path.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. Moving DOWN to (5,6) sets up a direct path to (5,5). However, moving LEFT to (4,7) could also be strategic for reaching (4,4) or (2,2). Need to weigh the options.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,3). If they move towards (4,4), they might take that apple. But since my snake is on the left side, moving towards (4,4) might lead to a collision. Alternatively, securing (5,5) first is safer.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,6) is the best next step. Then LEFT to (5,5) in the following move. This path avoids the enemy and efficiently reaches the apple.\n\nPotential risks: After moving DOWN, check if the enemy snake could block the path. Currently, they are at (4,3) and moving towards (4,4) might not interfere. \n\nFinal decision: Move DOWN to (5,6), setting up for the apple at (5,5).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2).

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step.

The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The available apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), and (4,1). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there.

So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple.

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Let's check each:\n\n- **UP**: (5,7) is part of my body. Can't go there. Collision.\n- **DOWN**: (5,5) is an apple. If I go there, I eat it and grow. But need to check if the path is safe. The next position (5,5) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (3,3), so they're not near (5,5). Safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,6). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,6). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would immediately collect it, which is great for points. However, after eating the apple, the snake's tail will grow by one segment. Need to plan the next move after that. But for this turn, getting the apple is a priority.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) could set up a path towards the apple at (4,4). But that's two moves away. Similarly, moving RIGHT to (6,6) might lead towards the apples on the right edge, but they're further.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,3). Their possible moves could be towards (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), or (4,3). If they move towards (4,3), they might be heading towards the apple at (4,4). But since I'm closer to (5,5), I should prioritize that.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,5) gives an immediate point. The risk is that after eating, the next move needs to avoid the body. But since the body grows from the tail, the next head position will be (5,5), and the body becomes [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the next move from (5,5) would need to go in a direction that doesn't hit the new body.\n\nBut for this turn, the best move is DOWN to collect the apple.

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple.

Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat.

The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So moving LEFT would get the apple, grow by 1, and the body would extend. That's a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,7). Check the board. The board's right edge is x=9. So (9,7) is valid. Is there anything there? Looking at the board state provided earlier, row 7 (y=7) at x=9 is part of the snake's body? Wait, the initial board had at row 7: \". . . . . . . A 2 .\" So (8,7) was the head (snake 2), and (9,7) was part of the body? Wait, no. Wait, the initial board state was before the last move. After moving DOWN to (8,7), the body is [(8,8), (9,8)]. So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there. So moving RIGHT is safe but doesn't gain a point.\n\nSo the options are LEFT (to (7,7) for the apple), DOWN (to (8,6)), or RIGHT (to (9,7)). UP is invalid.\n\nThe best move is LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That would add the apple, grow the snake, and the next body segments would be [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. Then the next move from (7,7) would need to avoid going back to (8,7) unless there's a path. But for now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nCheck for safety: Moving LEFT to (7,7) is valid. No enemy snakes there. The enemy snake is at (5,1), far away. So no collision risk. The apple is present. So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (7,7) with the body segments at [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The body is [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] plus the new segment from eating the apple, so the full body should be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. But the enemy is at (3,6), which is two rows below (3,8). If they move up, they could reach (3,7) or (3,8), but that's speculative. However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer. Each step right brings me closer to the apple without immediate threats. The enemy is moving away from my current path. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (4,9). Continue this strategy unless obstacles arise. \n\nDirection: RIGHT\n</think>\n\nTo continue towards the apple at (9,9), I'll move RIGHT again. The path remains clear, and the enemy snake is moving away from my route. \n\nStrategy next turn: Keep moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while monitoring enemy positions.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The available apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), and (4,1). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple.

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (4,2), so (5,7) is clear. Also, no body parts here. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (7,7). That's part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide. Invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? The closest apples are (5,5) and (4,4). Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,7), moving LEFT to (5,7) would be a step towards (5,5). Then from (5,7), moving DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's two more moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,6) then LEFT to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,8) might allow heading towards the right-side apples, but those are further away. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are on the right edge, but moving right from (6,8) would require passing through (7,8), which is not part of the body now. Wait, the body is [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. So (7,8) is empty. So from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8) is safe. Then continue right towards (9,4). But that's a longer path. Maybe not the best option.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. So moving LEFT to (5,7) is a good step. Let's check if that's safe. Yes, (5,7) is empty. Then next move would be DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That path seems viable.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) and then LEFT towards (5,6) and (5,5). Which path is shorter? Both take two moves after the first step. But moving LEFT first might be better as it's a direct approach.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,2). They might be heading towards (4,4) or (2,2). But their current position is (4,2), body at (4,1) and (5,1). So they might be moving up or left. Not sure, but their path doesn't interfere with mine immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,7), getting closer to (5,5). That's the most efficient path to an apple. So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,3) with body parts at [(4,2), (4,1)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,7). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,8). Check if this is safe. The current body segments are [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7)], so (5,8) isn't part of the body. The board shows no obstacles here. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,6). This position is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,7). Check for collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. No body parts here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,7). That's part of my own body (the first segment). Collision risk. Not safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNext, consider the closest apples. The apple at (5,5) is two moves away if I go DOWN then LEFT. The apple at (4,4) is also nearby. Let's plan a path:\n\n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: From there, moving DOWN to (4,6) and then LEFT to (4,5) would approach (4,4). Alternatively, moving DOWN directly towards (5,5) might be faster.\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Then LEFT to (5,5) would get the apple in two moves. This seems efficient.\n- **UP to (5,8)**: This might lead towards the apples on the right edge (9,4 or 9,2), but that's a longer path.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. Moving DOWN to (5,6) sets up a direct path to (5,5). However, moving LEFT to (4,7) could also be strategic for reaching (4,4) or (2,2). Need to weigh the options.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,3). If they move towards (4,4), they might take that apple. But since my snake is on the left side, moving towards (4,4) might lead to a collision. Alternatively, securing (5,5) first is safer.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,6) is the best next step. Then LEFT to (5,5) in the following move. This path avoids the enemy and efficiently reaches the apple.\n\nPotential risks: After moving DOWN, check if the enemy snake could block the path. Currently, they are at (4,3) and moving towards (4,4) might not interfere. \n\nFinal decision: Move DOWN to (5,6), setting up for the apple at (5,5).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5,5) now because the last move was DOWN to (5,5) where there was an apple. The body is [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] plus the new segment from eating the apple, so the full body should be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (4,5) with the body segments [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Wait, no, the problem states that after the last move (LEFT), the snake's position is (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. So the head is at (4,5), and the body follows. The apples available are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (0,5), (7,3). \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,5). The directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: (4,6). Check if this is safe. The board shows no snakes or walls here. The body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. (4,6) isn't part of the body. So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. The body would be [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. From (4,4), possible moves would be LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) is now part of the body). So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial. So moving DOWN seems optimal. \n\nCheck for any risks: enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP (3,3) which is their own body, DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT (4,2). They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice. It's safe and gains a point. \n\nNext, after eating, plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear.

The enemy snake is at (3,4) with no body. The last move was RIGHT, which brought the snake from (4,9) to (5,9).\n\nFirst, check the available directions from (5,9). Possible moves are LEFT (to (4,9)), RIGHT (to (6,9)), or DOWN (to (5,8)). UP would go to (5,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. The closest apple is at (9,9), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT each time would get closer. From (5,9), moving RIGHT to (6,9), then (7,9), (8,9), and finally (9,9). That's four moves to the right. Are there any obstacles in that path?\n\nLooking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) has the snake at (5,9) and the apple at (9,9). The other positions on row 9 (from x=5 to x=9) are empty except for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away and not in the path. Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat. There's no immediate threat here, so continuing RIGHT is better.\n\nPotential risks: Are there any other snakes or obstacles? The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is on row 4. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not in the current path. The snake's own path is clear.\n\nSo the best move is to continue RIGHT towards (9,9). Next turn, the snake will be at (6,9), and the same logic applies\u2014keep moving RIGHT until reaching the apple.

The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there.

So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple.

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The next position (5,5) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (3,3), so they're not near (5,5). Safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,6). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,6). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is directly below me.

Their possible moves could be towards (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), or (4,3). If they move towards (4,3), they might be heading towards the apple at (4,4). But since I'm closer to (5,5), I should prioritize that.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,5) gives an immediate point. The risk is that after eating, the next move needs to avoid the body. But since the body grows from the tail, the next head position will be (5,5), and the body becomes [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the next move from (5,5) would need to go in a direction that doesn't hit the new body.\n\nBut for this turn, the best move is DOWN to collect the apple.

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5,5) now because the last move was DOWN to (5,5) where there was an apple. The body is [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] plus the new segment from eating the apple, so the full body should be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Wait, no, the problem states that after the last move (LEFT), the snake's position is (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. So the head is at (4,5), and the body follows.

Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: (4,6). Check if this is safe. The board shows no snakes or walls here. The body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. (4,6) isn't part of the body. So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment.

So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial.

They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice.

Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could set up a path towards (7,3) by then moving right. Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

The apples are still at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with an empty body. Wait, in the previous state, the enemy was at (3,7), but now they're at (3,6). So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. But the enemy is at (3,6), which is two rows below (3,8). If they move up, they could reach (3,7) or (3,8), but that's speculative. However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

The enemy snake is at (3,4) with no body. The last move was RIGHT, which brought the snake from (4,9) to (5,9).\n\nFirst, check the available directions from (5,9). Possible moves are LEFT (to (4,9)), RIGHT (to (6,9)), or DOWN (to (5,8)). UP would go to (5,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. The closest apple is at (9,9), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT each time would get closer. From (5,9), moving RIGHT to (6,9), then (7,9), (8,9), and finally (9,9). That's four moves to the right. Are there any obstacles in that path?\n\nLooking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) has the snake at (5,9) and the apple at (9,9). The other positions on row 9 (from x=5 to x=9) are empty except for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away and not in the path. Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat. There's no immediate threat here, so continuing RIGHT is better.\n\nPotential risks: Are there any other snakes or obstacles? The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is on row 4. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not in the current path. The snake's own path is clear.\n\nSo the best move is to continue RIGHT towards (9,9).

Since the board is 10x10, (9,9) is the maximum coordinate. No risk of going out of bounds when moving to (9,9).\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to continue the path towards the apple at (9,9).\n</think>\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT  \n**Strategy:** Continue moving RIGHT along the top row to efficiently reach the apple at (9,9).

The rationale was to head towards the apple at (9,9). Now, continuing RIGHT makes sense because each step brings me closer to that apple. Moving RIGHT to (7,9), then (8,9), and finally (9,9) in three moves. There's no obstacle in that path according to the board state. The enemy snake is at (3,3), which is far away and not in the way. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point.

This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Is there anything there? Looking at the board state provided earlier, row 7 (y=7) at x=9 is part of the snake's body? Wait, the initial board had at row 7: \". . . . . . .

So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there.

So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (7,7) with the body segments at [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5,5) now because the last move was DOWN to (5,5) where there was an apple. The body is [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] plus the new segment from eating the apple, so the full body should be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Wait, no, the problem states that after the last move (LEFT), the snake's position is (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. So the head is at (4,5), and the body follows. The apples available are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (0,5), (7,3). \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,5). The directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: (4,6). Check if this is safe. The board shows no snakes or walls here. The body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. (4,6) isn't part of the body. So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. The body would be [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. From (4,4), possible moves would be LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) is now part of the body). So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial. So moving DOWN seems optimal. \n\nCheck for any risks: enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP (3,3) which is their own body, DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT (4,2). They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice.

The available apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with body [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (4,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,5). But (4,5) is part of my own body (the first segment). Collision with self. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is elsewhere. The enemy snake's body includes (3,3), but (4,3) is empty. So this seems safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,4). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,4). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is three steps right and one down from (4,4). The apple at (0,5) is far left. The others are at the edges. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,4), I can start heading towards (7,3). Moving DOWN to (4,3) might get me closer to (7,3) as well. LEFT to (3,4) doesn't directly lead to an apple but could be a safer path.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Their head is at (2,1). Their possible moves could be UP to (2,2) (which is part of their body), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). They might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nPrioritize getting apples. Moving RIGHT towards (7,3) seems strategic. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could set up a path towards (7,3) by then moving right. Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake is at (2,0) with body [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the head position (5,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my body. That's a collision. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is nearby. The position (5,3) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,4). That's part of my body (the first segment). Collision. So LEFT is invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,4). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3). From (5,4), moving DOWN to (5,3) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (7,3). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,4) and then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Both paths take two moves after the initial step. \n\nAnother apple is at (9,4), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT towards (6,4) could be a step in that direction, but it's further away. The apple at (0,5) is to the left, but moving left isn't possible now. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,0). Their possible moves might be towards the apples at (0,5) or (8,0), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,3), I can head towards (7,3) directly. If I move RIGHT to (6,4), I can either go towards (7,3) or (9,4). \n\nBut moving DOWN to (5,3) seems more efficient for reaching (7,3). Let's check the path from (5,3): next move RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's two moves. If I take RIGHT now, from (6,4), I need to go DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT. Same number of steps but requires a DOWN after RIGHT. \n\nAlso, moving DOWN to (5,3) avoids potential conflicts with the enemy's path. The enemy is on the left side, so moving right might be safer, but since they're at (2,0), they might not interfere immediately.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,3), the body will follow. The new body would be [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (5,7) is removed. No collision here.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,4), the body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? Prioritize the closest apple. Moving DOWN gets me closer to (7,3). So DOWN might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT could open up more options towards (9,4) or (8,0), but those are further. Since (7,3) is the nearest apple, focusing on that seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (5,3) to approach the apple at (7,3).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present.

So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2).

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple.

Since the board is 10x10, (9,9) is the maximum coordinate.

Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The available apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), and (4,1). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Is there anything there? Looking at the board state provided earlier, row 7 (y=7) at x=9 is part of the snake's body? Wait, the initial board had at row 7: \". . . . . . .

So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there.

UP is invalid.\n\nThe best move is LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That would add the apple, grow the snake, and the next body segments would be [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. Then the next move from (7,7) would need to avoid going back to (8,7) unless there's a path. But for now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nCheck for safety: Moving LEFT to (7,7) is valid. No enemy snakes there. The enemy snake is at (5,1), far away. So no collision risk. The apple is present. So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple. Since the apple at (7,7) is adjacent, it's better to take it now.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (7,7) with the body segments at [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Let's check each:\n\n- **UP**: (5,7) is part of my body. Can't go there. Collision.\n- **DOWN**: (5,5) is an apple. If I go there, I eat it and grow. But need to check if the path is safe. The next position (5,5) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (3,3), so they're not near (5,5). Safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,6). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,6). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would immediately collect it, which is great for points. However, after eating the apple, the snake's tail will grow by one segment. Need to plan the next move after that. But for this turn, getting the apple is a priority.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) could set up a path towards the apple at (4,4). But that's two moves away. Similarly, moving RIGHT to (6,6) might lead towards the apples on the right edge, but they're further.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,3). Their possible moves could be towards (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), or (4,3). If they move towards (4,3), they might be heading towards the apple at (4,4). But since I'm closer to (5,5), I should prioritize that.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,5) gives an immediate point. The risk is that after eating, the next move needs to avoid the body. But since the body grows from the tail, the next head position will be (5,5), and the body becomes [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the next move from (5,5) would need to go in a direction that doesn't hit the new body.\n\nBut for this turn, the best move is DOWN to collect the apple. It's the most efficient way to gain a point and the path is safe.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5,5) now because the last move was DOWN to (5,5) where there was an apple. The body is [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] plus the new segment from eating the apple, so the full body should be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Wait, no, the problem states that after the last move (LEFT), the snake's position is (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. So the head is at (4,5), and the body follows.

So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment.

So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial.

They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice.

Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my body. That's a collision. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is nearby. The position (5,3) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,4). That's part of my body (the first segment). Collision. So LEFT is invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,4). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3). From (5,4), moving DOWN to (5,3) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (7,3). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,4) and then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Both paths take two moves after the initial step. \n\nAnother apple is at (9,4), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT towards (6,4) could be a step in that direction, but it's further away. The apple at (0,5) is to the left, but moving left isn't possible now. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,0). Their possible moves might be towards the apples at (0,5) or (8,0), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,3), I can head towards (7,3) directly. If I move RIGHT to (6,4), I can either go towards (7,3) or (9,4). \n\nBut moving DOWN to (5,3) seems more efficient for reaching (7,3). Let's check the path from (5,3): next move RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's two moves. If I take RIGHT now, from (6,4), I need to go DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT. Same number of steps but requires a DOWN after RIGHT. \n\nAlso, moving DOWN to (5,3) avoids potential conflicts with the enemy's path. The enemy is on the left side, so moving right might be safer, but since they're at (2,0), they might not interfere immediately.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,3), the body will follow. The new body would be [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (5,7) is removed. No collision here.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,4), the body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? Prioritize the closest apple. Moving DOWN gets me closer to (7,3). So DOWN might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT could open up more options towards (9,4) or (8,0), but those are further.

Since they're on the left side, moving RIGHT towards (7,3) might avoid them.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,3), next move can be RIGHT again to (7,3) to get the apple. This path is direct and efficient.

It's a direct path and minimizes the number of moves needed to reach the apple. \n\nAdditionally, the apple at (9,4) is further right, so after collecting (7,3), heading towards (9,4) could be the next target.

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present.

So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. Also, moving down would take me away from the current apple. Since I'm already on row 9, staying there to reach (9,9) is more efficient.\n\nLEFT to (3,9) would be moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful.

Possible moves are LEFT (to (4,9)), RIGHT (to (6,9)), or DOWN (to (5,8)). UP would go to (5,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. The closest apple is at (9,9), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT each time would get closer.

Since the board is 10x10, (9,9) is the maximum coordinate. No risk of going out of bounds when moving to (9,9).\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to continue the path towards the apple at (9,9).\n</think>\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT  \n**Strategy:** Continue moving RIGHT along the top row to efficiently reach the apple at (9,9).

The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple. Since the apple at (7,7) is adjacent, it's better to take it now.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,3) with body parts at [(4,2), (4,1)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,7). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,8). Check if this is safe. The current body segments are [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7)], so (5,8) isn't part of the body. The board shows no obstacles here. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,6). This position is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,7). Check for collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. No body parts here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,7). That's part of my own body (the first segment). Collision risk. Not safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNext, consider the closest apples. The apple at (5,5) is two moves away if I go DOWN then LEFT. The apple at (4,4) is also nearby. Let's plan a path:\n\n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: From there, moving DOWN to (4,6) and then LEFT to (4,5) would approach (4,4). Alternatively, moving DOWN directly towards (5,5) might be faster.\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Then LEFT to (5,5) would get the apple in two moves. This seems efficient.\n- **UP to (5,8)**: This might lead towards the apples on the right edge (9,4 or 9,2), but that's a longer path.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. Moving DOWN to (5,6) sets up a direct path to (5,5). However, moving LEFT to (4,7) could also be strategic for reaching (4,4) or (2,2). Need to weigh the options.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,3). If they move towards (4,4), they might take that apple. But since my snake is on the left side, moving towards (4,4) might lead to a collision. Alternatively, securing (5,5) first is safer.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,6) is the best next step. Then LEFT to (5,5) in the following move. This path avoids the enemy and efficiently reaches the apple.\n\nPotential risks: After moving DOWN, check if the enemy snake could block the path. Currently, they are at (4,3) and moving towards (4,4) might not interfere. \n\nFinal decision: Move DOWN to (5,6), setting up for the apple at (5,5).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The next position (5,5) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (3,3), so they're not near (5,5). Safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,6). Check for obstacles.

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5,5) now because the last move was DOWN to (5,5) where there was an apple. The body is [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] plus the new segment from eating the apple, so the full body should be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples available are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (0,5), (7,3). \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,5). The directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: (4,6). Check if this is safe. The board shows no snakes or walls here. The body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. (4,6) isn't part of the body. So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. The body would be [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. From (4,4), possible moves would be LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) is now part of the body). So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial. So moving DOWN seems optimal. \n\nCheck for any risks: enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP (3,3) which is their own body, DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT (4,2). They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice. It's safe and gains a point. \n\nNext, after eating, plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The available apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with body [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (4,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,5). But (4,5) is part of my own body (the first segment). Collision with self. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is elsewhere. The enemy snake's body includes (3,3), but (4,3) is empty. So this seems safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,4). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,4). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is three steps right and one down from (4,4). The apple at (0,5) is far left. The others are at the edges. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,4), I can start heading towards (7,3). Moving DOWN to (4,3) might get me closer to (7,3) as well. LEFT to (3,4) doesn't directly lead to an apple but could be a safer path.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Their head is at (2,1). Their possible moves could be UP to (2,2) (which is part of their body), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). They might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nPrioritize getting apples. Moving RIGHT towards (7,3) seems strategic. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could set up a path towards (7,3) by then moving right. Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Their possible moves might be towards the apples at (0,5) or (8,0), but they're far from my current position.

If I move RIGHT to (6,4), I can either go towards (7,3) or (9,4). \n\nBut moving DOWN to (5,3) seems more efficient for reaching (7,3).

Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (6,4). Check if that's safe. Looking at the board state, the snake's body is at [(5,3), (5,4), ...]. (5,4) is part of the body, but (6,4) isn't listed. Wait, the current body is [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is empty. But wait, the board shows that at row 3 (y=3?), there's a '2' at (6,3). The board's Y-axis might be inverted since (0,0) is bottom left. Let me confirm the coordinates. The board's Y increases upwards, so row 0 is the bottom. So (6,3) is in the 4th row from the bottom (since y=0 is bottom). Moving UP would be to y=4. Checking the board state, in row 4 (y=4), there's a 'T' at (4,4) and (5,4) which are part of my body. But (6,4) is not listed as a body part. So moving UP to (6,4) is safe? Wait, the body segments are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is not part of the body. So UP is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (6,2). Check if that's safe. The board shows at (6,2) there's no snake or obstacle. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (5,3). But (5,3) is part of my body. So that's a collision. Can't go LEFT.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (7,3). There's an apple at (7,3). If I move here, I'll eat the apple and grow. That's good. But need to check if the path is safe. (7,3) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (4,0), so they're far away. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is directly to the RIGHT. Eating that would give a point. So moving RIGHT is the most direct way to get an apple. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,3), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. After eating, the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still at (5,5). So moving RIGHT again would be possible if there's a path. But first, let's focus on this move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,4) might lead towards the apple at (9,4) but that's further away. Moving DOWN to (6,2) could lead towards the apple at (9,2) but also far. The apple at (8,0) is even further down.

Their head is at (4,0), so they might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are far from my current position.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. But the enemy is at (3,6), which is two rows below (3,8). If they move up, they could reach (3,7) or (3,8), but that's speculative. However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

Continue this strategy unless obstacles arise. \n\nDirection: RIGHT\n</think>\n\nTo continue towards the apple at (9,9), I'll move RIGHT again.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

The other positions on row 9 (from x=5 to x=9) are empty except for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away and not in the path. Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat.

Since the board is 10x10, (9,9) is the maximum coordinate. No risk of going out of bounds when moving to (9,9).\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to continue the path towards the apple at (9,9).\n</think>\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT  \n**Strategy:** Continue moving RIGHT along the top row to efficiently reach the apple at (9,9).

The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (7,7) with the body segments at [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So (7,8) is empty. So from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8) is safe. Then continue right towards (9,4). But that's a longer path. Maybe not the best option.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest.

Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Wait, no, the problem states that after the last move (LEFT), the snake's position is (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. So the head is at (4,5), and the body follows. The apples available are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (0,5), (7,3). \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,5). The directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: (4,6). Check if this is safe. The board shows no snakes or walls here. The body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. (4,6) isn't part of the body. So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. The body would be [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. From (4,4), possible moves would be LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) is now part of the body). So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial. So moving DOWN seems optimal. \n\nCheck for any risks: enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP (3,3) which is their own body, DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT (4,2). They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice. It's safe and gains a point. \n\nNext, after eating, plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The available apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with body [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (4,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,5). But (4,5) is part of my own body (the first segment). Collision with self. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is elsewhere. The enemy snake's body includes (3,3), but (4,3) is empty. So this seems safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,4). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,4). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is three steps right and one down from (4,4). The apple at (0,5) is far left. The others are at the edges. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,4), I can start heading towards (7,3). Moving DOWN to (4,3) might get me closer to (7,3) as well. LEFT to (3,4) doesn't directly lead to an apple but could be a safer path.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Their head is at (2,1). Their possible moves could be UP to (2,2) (which is part of their body), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). They might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nPrioritize getting apples. Moving RIGHT towards (7,3) seems strategic. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could set up a path towards (7,3) by then moving right. Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The closest apple is at (7,3). From (5,4), moving DOWN to (5,3) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (7,3). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,4) and then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Both paths take two moves after the initial step. \n\nAnother apple is at (9,4), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT towards (6,4) could be a step in that direction, but it's further away. The apple at (0,5) is to the left, but moving left isn't possible now. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,0). Their possible moves might be towards the apples at (0,5) or (8,0), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,3), I can head towards (7,3) directly. If I move RIGHT to (6,4), I can either go towards (7,3) or (9,4). \n\nBut moving DOWN to (5,3) seems more efficient for reaching (7,3). Let's check the path from (5,3): next move RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's two moves. If I take RIGHT now, from (6,4), I need to go DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT. Same number of steps but requires a DOWN after RIGHT. \n\nAlso, moving DOWN to (5,3) avoids potential conflicts with the enemy's path. The enemy is on the left side, so moving right might be safer, but since they're at (2,0), they might not interfere immediately.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,3), the body will follow.

So DOWN might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT could open up more options towards (9,4) or (8,0), but those are further.

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3,0) with body [(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the head position (5,3). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,4). But (5,4) is part of my body. Collision. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,2). Check the board. The position (5,2) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,3). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,3). The apple at (7,3) is nearby. Position (6,3) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3). From (5,3), moving RIGHT to (6,3) would get me closer. Then, another RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (4,3) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's further away. Moving DOWN to (5,2) could explore the lower area, but there's an apple at (9,2) which is far.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,0). Their body is along (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). They might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). Since they're on the left side, moving RIGHT towards (7,3) might avoid them.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,3), next move can be RIGHT again to (7,3) to get the apple. This path is direct and efficient. Moving LEFT to (4,3) could lead towards (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk collision with the enemy if they move upwards. Moving DOWN to (5,2) doesn't immediately lead to an apple but could explore other areas.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT to (6,3), the body will follow. The new body would be [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail (5,6) is removed. No collision here. Similarly, moving LEFT or DOWN would also be safe.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (7,3), moving RIGHT is the best option. It's a direct path and minimizes the number of moves needed to reach the apple. \n\nAdditionally, the apple at (9,4) is further right, so after collecting (7,3), heading towards (9,4) could be the next target. However, the enemy's position isn't an immediate threat here. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is RIGHT to (6,3) to approach the apple at (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (4,0) with body [(3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check the possible moves from my head position (6,3). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (6,4). Check if that's safe. Looking at the board state, the snake's body is at [(5,3), (5,4), ...]. (5,4) is part of the body, but (6,4) isn't listed. Wait, the current body is [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is empty. But wait, the board shows that at row 3 (y=3?), there's a '2' at (6,3). The board's Y-axis might be inverted since (0,0) is bottom left. Let me confirm the coordinates. The board's Y increases upwards, so row 0 is the bottom. So (6,3) is in the 4th row from the bottom (since y=0 is bottom). Moving UP would be to y=4. Checking the board state, in row 4 (y=4), there's a 'T' at (4,4) and (5,4) which are part of my body. But (6,4) is not listed as a body part. So moving UP to (6,4) is safe? Wait, the body segments are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is not part of the body. So UP is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (6,2). Check if that's safe. The board shows at (6,2) there's no snake or obstacle. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (5,3). But (5,3) is part of my body. So that's a collision. Can't go LEFT.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (7,3). There's an apple at (7,3). If I move here, I'll eat the apple and grow. That's good. But need to check if the path is safe. (7,3) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (4,0), so they're far away. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is directly to the RIGHT. Eating that would give a point. So moving RIGHT is the most direct way to get an apple. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,3), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. After eating, the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still at (5,5). So moving RIGHT again would be possible if there's a path. But first, let's focus on this move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,4) might lead towards the apple at (9,4) but that's further away. Moving DOWN to (6,2) could lead towards the apple at (9,2) but also far. The apple at (8,0) is even further down. The apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body.\n\nSo the best immediate gain is moving RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's a point and growth. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions with enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,0) with body [(3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]. They are on the lower left. Their head is at (4,0), so they might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are far from my current position. So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's safe and gains a point.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (5,0) with body [(4,0), (3,0), (2,0)]. The board shows that my head is at (7,3), and the last move was RIGHT, which probably moved me from (6,3) to (7,3), eating the apple there. Now, after eating, my body has grown, so the next move needs to account for that.\n\nPossible moves from (7,3) are UP (to 7,4), DOWN (to 7,2), LEFT (to 6,3), or RIGHT (to 8,3). Let's check each direction:\n\n1. **UP (7,4)**: Check if this cell is safe. The board state shows that at (7,4), there's nothing mentioned. The enemy snake is far away. My own body segments are [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. (7,4) isn't part of my body. So moving UP is safe unless there's a wall. Since y=4 is within 0-9, it's valid. So UP is possible.\n\n2. **DOWN (7,2)**: Check safety. The board shows (7,2) is empty. No snakes there. Valid move.\n\n3. **LEFT (6,3)**: This is the previous position of the head, which is now part of the body. So moving LEFT would collide with (6,3), which is part of my body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Check if (8,3) is safe. The board shows an apple at (8,0), but (8,3) isn't listed as having an apple or a snake. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (7,9) at the top right, (0,5) on the left, and (8,0) at the bottom right. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), that's moving towards the right edge where apples (9,4) and (9,2) are. Alternatively, moving UP towards (7,4) could lead towards (7,9) but that's a long path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) could head towards (9,2). \n\nBut let's check if there's an apple in the immediate path. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are two steps away from (8,3) and (7,2) respectively. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't get an apple immediately. Moving UP to (7,4) also doesn't. The next apple in that direction would require more steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (7,9) which is at the top right. From (7,3), moving UP several times would get there, but that's a long path. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy is at (5,0), which is far from my current position. They might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the immediate options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe. \n\nWhich direction is safest and leads towards an apple? Let's think:\n\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving towards the right edge. From there, next moves could be UP to (8,4) towards (9,4) or DOWN to (8,2) towards (9,2). Both are possible. \n\n- **UP (7,4)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,4) or continue UP. \n\n- **DOWN (7,2)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,2) or further DOWN. \n\nSince the apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are on the right edge, moving RIGHT now positions me closer to both. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't immediately get an apple. But it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) might allow me to then move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4). That's two moves to get the apple. Similarly, moving DOWN to (7,2) and then RIGHT to (8,2), then to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), the next move would be to (9,3) if I go RIGHT again, but (9,3) is not an apple. To reach (9,4), I need to go UP from (8,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) and then RIGHT to (8,4), then UP to (9,4). That path seems possible. \n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't box myself in. Let's also check the current body. After moving RIGHT to (8,3), the new body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail is at (5,5), so there's space behind. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) to approach the apple at (9,2). From (7,2), moving RIGHT twice to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is less risky? Let's think about possible obstacles. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are on the lower left. They might be moving towards (8,0) or (0,5). But their path doesn't intersect mine immediately. \n\nSo, the safest immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are both two moves away. Moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows flexibility to go UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN now could set a direction towards those apples. \n\nBut since there's no immediate apple in the current direction, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is a neutral move that keeps options open. \n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP from (7,3) to (7,4), then continue UP towards (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards (7,9). But that's six moves up. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Also three moves. \n\nHmm. Both paths take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it positions me closer to both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now could start the ascent towards (7,9). \n\nBut (7,9) is quite far. Maybe prioritize the closer apples first. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom right. If I move DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2), then further DOWN to (7,1), etc., but that's moving away from most apples. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the best options are to move towards the right edge apples. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a good step towards (9,4) or (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut which is safer? Let's check the board again. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 4 (y=4) has T (my body) at (4,4) and (5,4). The apple at (9,4) is in row 4. \n\nRow 2 (y=2) has an apple at (9,2). \n\nSo moving RIGHT to (8,3) is in row 3. Then, from (8,3), moving UP to (8,4) (row 4) would be safe if there's no obstacle. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) (row 4), which is safe. \n\nBut in both cases, the next move would need to check for body parts. \n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT back to (7,3) because that's the body. So after moving RIGHT, the next options would be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. \n\nSimilarly, moving UP to (7,4) would allow next moves UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. \n\nBut since the goal is to reach the apples, moving RIGHT seems better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to start the path upwards. \n\nBut without immediate apple in that direction, perhaps moving RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother point: the apple at (7,9) is at the top right. If I can reach that, it's a high-value target, but it's far. However, moving UP now might not be the most efficient. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) to get that apple. \n\nBut (9,3) is not an apple, so that's an extra step. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Same number of steps. \n\nSo both paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first gives more flexibility. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might avoid potential collisions. \n\nWait, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The next move to (8,3) would leave the tail at (5,5), so the body is growing. \n\nBut since I just ate an apple in the last move, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows by one segment. So after moving to (7,3) (the apple), the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] plus the new head. Wait, no: the head moves to (7,3), and the body follows. So the body after eating the apple would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When you move, the head moves forward, and the tail follows unless you ate an apple. \n\nWait, the rules state that if you move onto an apple, you grow. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. \n\nSo after eating the apple at (7,3), the snake's body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nOriginal body before moving: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The head was at (6,3). Then moved RIGHT to (7,3), eating the apple. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. Because when you eat an apple, you add a new head and the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The snake moves: head moves to new position, each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't shorten, so the body grows by one. \n\nSo original length was 6 segments (head + 5 body parts). After eating an apple, the length becomes 7. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. If the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body increases by one segment. \n\nSo before the move, the body was [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] (head at (6,3), then the next segments). After moving RIGHT to (7,3) and eating the apple, the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, that would be adding a new head and keeping the tail. So the tail is now (5,5), but the body segments are the previous ones plus the new head. \n\nWait, perhaps the body after eating is [new head] + previous body without cutting the tail. So the length increases by one. \n\nSo in this case, after moving to (7,3), the body becomes [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still (5,5), but the body is longer. \n\nTherefore, in the current state, the snake's body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. \n\nSo when considering possible moves, the body includes (7,3) as the head, followed by (6,3), (5,3), etc. \n\nSo moving LEFT to (6,3) would collide with the next body segment. Hence, LEFT is unsafe. \n\nNow, back to the current possible moves. \n\nIf I move UP to (7,4), that's safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, two moves after the first to reach the apple. \n\nBut moving UP now might be better to start the ascent. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (8,3) keeps options open for both UP and DOWN next. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,2) is two moves down from (8,3). So moving RIGHT to (8,3), then DOWN to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nBut that's also possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT gives flexibility to go either UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) allows moving RIGHT towards (9,4). \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are far away. The main danger is my own body. \n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT, but can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT again to (9,3), which is safe. Then UP to (9,4) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, it's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nBoth paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it positions me closer to both apples (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might be safer if there's a potential collision in the right direction. \n\nBut there's no indication of that. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), I could move UP to (8,4), then continue UP towards (8,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nGiven the options, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a solid choice to position towards both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) to head towards (9,2). \n\nBut moving DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2) is safe. Then next move RIGHT to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nThat's two moves after DOWN to reach the apple. \n\nSo comparing the two options: moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows access to both (9,4) and (9,2) in two moves, while moving DOWN to (7,2) focuses on (9,2). \n\nWhich apple is closer? Both are two moves away from their respective paths. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (9,4) is more accessible from (8,3) than (9,2) from (7,2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,2) is shorter. \n\nBut without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother factor: the apple at (9,4) is in row 4, which is where part of my body is. But that's the tail end. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is in row 2, which is clear. \n\nBut both are viable. \n\nGiven that, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is the best choice to keep options open. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut I need to decide based on current safety and potential growth. \n\nSince all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe, the best move is to head towards the nearest apple. \n\nBut which apple is nearest? \n\nThe apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nThe apple at (9,2) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. \n\nThe apple at (7,9) is six moves up. \n\nThe apple at (8,0) is far down and right. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but blocked. \n\nSo the closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nSince moving RIGHT allows me to choose between them next, that's the best option. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (8,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

The apples are still at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with an empty body. Wait, in the previous state, the enemy was at (3,7), but now they're at (3,6). So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. But the enemy is at (3,6), which is two rows below (3,8). If they move up, they could reach (3,7) or (3,8), but that's speculative. However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

Possible moves are LEFT (to (4,9)), RIGHT (to (6,9)), or DOWN (to (5,8)). UP would go to (5,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. The closest apple is at (9,9), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT each time would get closer. From (5,9), moving RIGHT to (6,9), then (7,9), (8,9), and finally (9,9). That's four moves to the right.

The other positions on row 9 (from x=5 to x=9) are empty except for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away and not in the path. Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat.

Since the board is 10x10, (9,9) is the maximum coordinate. No risk of going out of bounds when moving to (9,9).\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to continue the path towards the apple at (9,9).\n</think>\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT  \n**Strategy:** Continue moving RIGHT along the top row to efficiently reach the apple at (9,9).

The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So moving LEFT would get the apple, grow by 1, and the body would extend. That's a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,7). Check the board. The board's right edge is x=9. So (9,7) is valid. Is there anything there? Looking at the board state provided earlier, row 7 (y=7) at x=9 is part of the snake's body? Wait, the initial board had at row 7: \". . . . . . . A 2 .\" So (8,7) was the head (snake 2), and (9,7) was part of the body? Wait, no. Wait, the initial board state was before the last move. After moving DOWN to (8,7), the body is [(8,8), (9,8)]. So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there. So moving RIGHT is safe but doesn't gain a point.\n\nSo the options are LEFT (to (7,7) for the apple), DOWN (to (8,6)), or RIGHT (to (9,7)). UP is invalid.\n\nThe best move is LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That would add the apple, grow the snake, and the next body segments would be [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. Then the next move from (7,7) would need to avoid going back to (8,7) unless there's a path. But for now, getting the apple is the priority.\n\nCheck for safety: Moving LEFT to (7,7) is valid. No enemy snakes there. The enemy snake is at (5,1), far away. So no collision risk. The apple is present. So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple. Since the apple at (7,7) is adjacent, it's better to take it now.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (7,7) with the body segments at [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Wait, no, the problem states that after the last move (LEFT), the snake's position is (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. So the head is at (4,5), and the body follows. The apples available are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (0,5), (7,3). \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,5). The directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: (4,6). Check if this is safe. The board shows no snakes or walls here. The body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. (4,6) isn't part of the body. So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. The body would be [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. From (4,4), possible moves would be LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) is now part of the body). So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial. So moving DOWN seems optimal. \n\nCheck for any risks: enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP (3,3) which is their own body, DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT (4,2). They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice. It's safe and gains a point. \n\nNext, after eating, plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The available apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with body [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (4,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,5). But (4,5) is part of my own body (the first segment). Collision with self. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is elsewhere. The enemy snake's body includes (3,3), but (4,3) is empty. So this seems safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,4). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,4). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is three steps right and one down from (4,4). The apple at (0,5) is far left. The others are at the edges. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,4), I can start heading towards (7,3). Moving DOWN to (4,3) might get me closer to (7,3) as well. LEFT to (3,4) doesn't directly lead to an apple but could be a safer path.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Their head is at (2,1). Their possible moves could be UP to (2,2) (which is part of their body), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). They might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nPrioritize getting apples. Moving RIGHT towards (7,3) seems strategic. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could set up a path towards (7,3) by then moving right. Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake is at (2,0) with body [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the head position (5,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my body. That's a collision. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is nearby. The position (5,3) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,4). That's part of my body (the first segment). Collision. So LEFT is invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,4). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3). From (5,4), moving DOWN to (5,3) would get me closer. Then, moving RIGHT twice to (7,3). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,4) and then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Both paths take two moves after the initial step. \n\nAnother apple is at (9,4), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT towards (6,4) could be a step in that direction, but it's further away. The apple at (0,5) is to the left, but moving left isn't possible now. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,0). Their possible moves might be towards the apples at (0,5) or (8,0), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,3), I can head towards (7,3) directly. If I move RIGHT to (6,4), I can either go towards (7,3) or (9,4). \n\nBut moving DOWN to (5,3) seems more efficient for reaching (7,3). Let's check the path from (5,3): next move RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's two moves. If I take RIGHT now, from (6,4), I need to go DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT. Same number of steps but requires a DOWN after RIGHT. \n\nAlso, moving DOWN to (5,3) avoids potential conflicts with the enemy's path. The enemy is on the left side, so moving right might be safer, but since they're at (2,0), they might not interfere immediately.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,3), the body will follow. The new body would be [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (5,7) is removed. No collision here.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,4), the body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? Prioritize the closest apple. Moving DOWN gets me closer to (7,3). So DOWN might be better. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT could open up more options towards (9,4) or (8,0), but those are further. Since (7,3) is the nearest apple, focusing on that seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (5,3) to approach the apple at (7,3).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (4,0) with body [(3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check the possible moves from my head position (6,3). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (6,4). Check if that's safe. Looking at the board state, the snake's body is at [(5,3), (5,4), ...]. (5,4) is part of the body, but (6,4) isn't listed. Wait, the current body is [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is empty. But wait, the board shows that at row 3 (y=3?), there's a '2' at (6,3). The board's Y-axis might be inverted since (0,0) is bottom left. Let me confirm the coordinates. The board's Y increases upwards, so row 0 is the bottom. So (6,3) is in the 4th row from the bottom (since y=0 is bottom). Moving UP would be to y=4. Checking the board state, in row 4 (y=4), there's a 'T' at (4,4) and (5,4) which are part of my body. But (6,4) is not listed as a body part. So moving UP to (6,4) is safe? Wait, the body segments are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is not part of the body. So UP is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (6,2). Check if that's safe. The board shows at (6,2) there's no snake or obstacle. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (5,3). But (5,3) is part of my body. So that's a collision. Can't go LEFT.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (7,3). There's an apple at (7,3). If I move here, I'll eat the apple and grow. That's good. But need to check if the path is safe. (7,3) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (4,0), so they're far away. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is directly to the RIGHT. Eating that would give a point. So moving RIGHT is the most direct way to get an apple. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,3), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. After eating, the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still at (5,5). So moving RIGHT again would be possible if there's a path. But first, let's focus on this move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,4) might lead towards the apple at (9,4) but that's further away. Moving DOWN to (6,2) could lead towards the apple at (9,2) but also far. The apple at (8,0) is even further down. The apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body.\n\nSo the best immediate gain is moving RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's a point and growth. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions with enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,0) with body [(3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]. They are on the lower left. Their head is at (4,0), so they might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are far from my current position. So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's safe and gains a point.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (5,0) with body [(4,0), (3,0), (2,0)]. The board shows that my head is at (7,3), and the last move was RIGHT, which probably moved me from (6,3) to (7,3), eating the apple there. Now, after eating, my body has grown, so the next move needs to account for that.\n\nPossible moves from (7,3) are UP (to 7,4), DOWN (to 7,2), LEFT (to 6,3), or RIGHT (to 8,3). Let's check each direction:\n\n1. **UP (7,4)**: Check if this cell is safe. The board state shows that at (7,4), there's nothing mentioned. The enemy snake is far away. My own body segments are [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. (7,4) isn't part of my body. So moving UP is safe unless there's a wall. Since y=4 is within 0-9, it's valid. So UP is possible.\n\n2. **DOWN (7,2)**: Check safety. The board shows (7,2) is empty. No snakes there. Valid move.\n\n3. **LEFT (6,3)**: This is the previous position of the head, which is now part of the body. So moving LEFT would collide with (6,3), which is part of my body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Check if (8,3) is safe. The board shows an apple at (8,0), but (8,3) isn't listed as having an apple or a snake. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (7,9) at the top right, (0,5) on the left, and (8,0) at the bottom right. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), that's moving towards the right edge where apples (9,4) and (9,2) are. Alternatively, moving UP towards (7,4) could lead towards (7,9) but that's a long path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) could head towards (9,2). \n\nBut let's check if there's an apple in the immediate path. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are two steps away from (8,3) and (7,2) respectively. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't get an apple immediately. Moving UP to (7,4) also doesn't. The next apple in that direction would require more steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (7,9) which is at the top right. From (7,3), moving UP several times would get there, but that's a long path. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy is at (5,0), which is far from my current position. They might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the immediate options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe. \n\nWhich direction is safest and leads towards an apple? Let's think:\n\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving towards the right edge. From there, next moves could be UP to (8,4) towards (9,4) or DOWN to (8,2) towards (9,2). Both are possible. \n\n- **UP (7,4)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,4) or continue UP. \n\n- **DOWN (7,2)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,2) or further DOWN. \n\nSince the apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are on the right edge, moving RIGHT now positions me closer to both. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't immediately get an apple. But it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) might allow me to then move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4). That's two moves to get the apple. Similarly, moving DOWN to (7,2) and then RIGHT to (8,2), then to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), the next move would be to (9,3) if I go RIGHT again, but (9,3) is not an apple. To reach (9,4), I need to go UP from (8,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) and then RIGHT to (8,4), then UP to (9,4). That path seems possible. \n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't box myself in. Let's also check the current body. After moving RIGHT to (8,3), the new body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail is at (5,5), so there's space behind. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) to approach the apple at (9,2). From (7,2), moving RIGHT twice to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is less risky? Let's think about possible obstacles. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are on the lower left. They might be moving towards (8,0) or (0,5). But their path doesn't intersect mine immediately. \n\nSo, the safest immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are both two moves away. Moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows flexibility to go UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN now could set a direction towards those apples. \n\nBut since there's no immediate apple in the current direction, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is a neutral move that keeps options open. \n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP from (7,3) to (7,4), then continue UP towards (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards (7,9). But that's six moves up. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Also three moves. \n\nHmm. Both paths take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it positions me closer to both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now could start the ascent towards (7,9). \n\nBut (7,9) is quite far. Maybe prioritize the closer apples first. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom right. If I move DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2), then further DOWN to (7,1), etc., but that's moving away from most apples. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the best options are to move towards the right edge apples. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a good step towards (9,4) or (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut which is safer? Let's check the board again. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 4 (y=4) has T (my body) at (4,4) and (5,4). The apple at (9,4) is in row 4. \n\nRow 2 (y=2) has an apple at (9,2). \n\nSo moving RIGHT to (8,3) is in row 3. Then, from (8,3), moving UP to (8,4) (row 4) would be safe if there's no obstacle. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) (row 4), which is safe. \n\nBut in both cases, the next move would need to check for body parts. \n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT back to (7,3) because that's the body. So after moving RIGHT, the next options would be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. \n\nSimilarly, moving UP to (7,4) would allow next moves UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. \n\nBut since the goal is to reach the apples, moving RIGHT seems better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to start the path upwards. \n\nBut without immediate apple in that direction, perhaps moving RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother point: the apple at (7,9) is at the top right. If I can reach that, it's a high-value target, but it's far. However, moving UP now might not be the most efficient. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) to get that apple. \n\nBut (9,3) is not an apple, so that's an extra step. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Same number of steps. \n\nSo both paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first gives more flexibility. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might avoid potential collisions. \n\nWait, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The next move to (8,3) would leave the tail at (5,5), so the body is growing. \n\nBut since I just ate an apple in the last move, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows by one segment. So after moving to (7,3) (the apple), the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] plus the new head. Wait, no: the head moves to (7,3), and the body follows. So the body after eating the apple would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When you move, the head moves forward, and the tail follows unless you ate an apple. \n\nWait, the rules state that if you move onto an apple, you grow. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. \n\nSo after eating the apple at (7,3), the snake's body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nOriginal body before moving: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The head was at (6,3). Then moved RIGHT to (7,3), eating the apple. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. Because when you eat an apple, you add a new head and the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The snake moves: head moves to new position, each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't shorten, so the body grows by one. \n\nSo original length was 6 segments (head + 5 body parts). After eating an apple, the length becomes 7. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. If the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body increases by one segment. \n\nSo before the move, the body was [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] (head at (6,3), then the next segments). After moving RIGHT to (7,3) and eating the apple, the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, that would be adding a new head and keeping the tail. So the tail is now (5,5), but the body segments are the previous ones plus the new head. \n\nWait, perhaps the body after eating is [new head] + previous body without cutting the tail. So the length increases by one. \n\nSo in this case, after moving to (7,3), the body becomes [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still (5,5), but the body is longer. \n\nTherefore, in the current state, the snake's body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. \n\nSo when considering possible moves, the body includes (7,3) as the head, followed by (6,3), (5,3), etc. \n\nSo moving LEFT to (6,3) would collide with the next body segment. Hence, LEFT is unsafe. \n\nNow, back to the current possible moves. \n\nIf I move UP to (7,4), that's safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, two moves after the first to reach the apple. \n\nBut moving UP now might be better to start the ascent. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (8,3) keeps options open for both UP and DOWN next. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,2) is two moves down from (8,3). So moving RIGHT to (8,3), then DOWN to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nBut that's also possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT gives flexibility to go either UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) allows moving RIGHT towards (9,4). \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are far away. The main danger is my own body. \n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT, but can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT again to (9,3), which is safe. Then UP to (9,4) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, it's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nBoth paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it positions me closer to both apples (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might be safer if there's a potential collision in the right direction. \n\nBut there's no indication of that. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), I could move UP to (8,4), then continue UP towards (8,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nGiven the options, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a solid choice to position towards both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) to head towards (9,2). \n\nBut moving DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2) is safe. Then next move RIGHT to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nThat's two moves after DOWN to reach the apple. \n\nSo comparing the two options: moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows access to both (9,4) and (9,2) in two moves, while moving DOWN to (7,2) focuses on (9,2). \n\nWhich apple is closer? Both are two moves away from their respective paths. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (9,4) is more accessible from (8,3) than (9,2) from (7,2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,2) is shorter. \n\nBut without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother factor: the apple at (9,4) is in row 4, which is where part of my body is. But that's the tail end. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is in row 2, which is clear. \n\nBut both are viable. \n\nGiven that, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is the best choice to keep options open. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut I need to decide based on current safety and potential growth. \n\nSince all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe, the best move is to head towards the nearest apple. \n\nBut which apple is nearest? \n\nThe apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nThe apple at (9,2) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. \n\nThe apple at (7,9) is six moves up. \n\nThe apple at (8,0) is far down and right. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but blocked. \n\nSo the closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nSince moving RIGHT allows me to choose between them next, that's the best option. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (8,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (8,3) now, right? Because the last move was RIGHT from (7,3) to (8,3). The body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The apples are still at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9). The enemy snake is at (6,0) with body [(5,0), (4,0), (3,0)].\n\nPossible moves from (8,3) are UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3), or RIGHT to (9,3). Let's check each:\n\n1. **UP (8,4)**: Is this safe? The board shows no snakes there. My body segments are [(7,3), (6,3), etc.]. (8,4) isn't part of my body. Valid move.\n\n2. **DOWN (8,2)**: Also safe. No obstacles mentioned. \n\n3. **LEFT (7,3)**: That's part of my body (the first segment after the head). Moving LEFT would collide. Unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9,3)**: Within the board. No apple there, but safe unless another snake is present. The enemy snake is far away. Valid.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest are (9,4) and (9,2). Moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4) gets closer to (9,4). Next move could be RIGHT to (9,4). Moving DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2). Moving RIGHT to (9,3) doesn't get an apple but positions for future moves.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's think:\n\n- **UP to (8,4)**: One step closer to (9,4). Next move RIGHT to (9,4) would eat the apple. That's efficient.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,2)**: Next move RIGHT to (9,2) for the apple. Also efficient.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,3)**: Then UP to (9,4) or DOWN to (9,2). Adds an extra step but keeps options open.\n\nSince both apples are equally reachable in two moves, but moving UP or DOWN now directly targets one. Which apple is safer? The enemy snake is at (6,0), so they might be heading towards (8,0) or (0,5). Not a threat here.\n\nIf I go UP to (8,4), next move RIGHT to (9,4) gets the apple. That's good. Similarly, DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2). Both are viable. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3) allows me to choose between UP or DOWN next. But that adds a step. \n\nSince the goal is to collect apples quickly, moving UP or DOWN now is better. \n\nWhich apple to prioritize? (9,4) is in the same column as my current position if I move UP. (9,2) is two steps down and right. \n\nBut both are equally distant. Maybe choose the one with fewer obstacles. Looking at the board, (9,4) is in row 4, which has some of my body segments (like (4,4), (5,4)), but those are far away. The path to (9,4) from (8,4) is clear. \n\nSimilarly, (9,2) is in row 2, which seems clear. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that's more in line with current direction. Since I moved RIGHT last time, continuing towards the right edge makes sense. \n\nBut to get the apple, moving UP now to (8,4) then RIGHT is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3) might risk getting stuck if there's no apple. \n\nSo the best move is UP to (8,4) to head towards (9,4). \n\nWait, but after moving UP to (8,4), the next move would be RIGHT to (9,4), which is the apple. That's two moves total. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) is also two moves. \n\nBut moving UP now is more direct. \n\nYes, moving UP to (8,4) is better. \n\nSo the next move should be UP.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7).

However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. Also, moving down would take me away from the current apple. Since I'm already on row 9, staying there to reach (9,9) is more efficient.\n\nLEFT to (3,9) would be moving away from the apple, which isn't helpful. So the best move is RIGHT again. \n\nI should continue moving RIGHT until I reach (9,9). No immediate threats detected. Next turn, if I'm at (5,9), the same logic applies: keep moving right. The strategy remains consistent.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the apple at (9,9) efficiently, I'll continue moving RIGHT along the top row. The path is clear, and the enemy poses no immediate threat here. \n\n**Next move:** RIGHT"

Possible moves are LEFT (to (4,9)), RIGHT (to (6,9)), or DOWN (to (5,8)). UP would go to (5,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples while avoiding collisions. The closest apple is at (9,9), which is to the right. Moving RIGHT each time would get closer. From (5,9), moving RIGHT to (6,9), then (7,9), (8,9), and finally (9,9). That's four moves to the right. Are there any obstacles in that path?\n\nLooking at the board state, row 9 (the top row) has the snake at (5,9) and the apple at (9,9). The other positions on row 9 (from x=5 to x=9) are empty except for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away and not in the path. Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path.

Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat.

Since the board is 10x10, (9,9) is the maximum coordinate. No risk of going out of bounds when moving to (9,9).\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to continue the path towards the apple at (9,9).\n</think>\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT  \n**Strategy:** Continue moving RIGHT along the top row to efficiently reach the apple at (9,9).

The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The available apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), and (4,1). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So (9,7) is empty. So moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe. But there's no apple there.

No enemy snakes there. The enemy snake is at (5,1), far away. So no collision risk. The apple is present. So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple. Since the apple at (7,7) is adjacent, it's better to take it now.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,3) with body parts at [(4,2), (4,1)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,7). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,8). Check if this is safe. The current body segments are [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7)], so (5,8) isn't part of the body. The board shows no obstacles here. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,6). This position is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,7). Check for collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. No body parts here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,7). That's part of my own body (the first segment). Collision risk. Not safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNext, consider the closest apples. The apple at (5,5) is two moves away if I go DOWN then LEFT. The apple at (4,4) is also nearby. Let's plan a path:\n\n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: From there, moving DOWN to (4,6) and then LEFT to (4,5) would approach (4,4). Alternatively, moving DOWN directly towards (5,5) might be faster.\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Then LEFT to (5,5) would get the apple in two moves. This seems efficient.\n- **UP to (5,8)**: This might lead towards the apples on the right edge (9,4 or 9,2), but that's a longer path.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. Moving DOWN to (5,6) sets up a direct path to (5,5). However, moving LEFT to (4,7) could also be strategic for reaching (4,4) or (2,2). Need to weigh the options.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,3). If they move towards (4,4), they might take that apple. But since my snake is on the left side, moving towards (4,4) might lead to a collision. Alternatively, securing (5,5) first is safer.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,6) is the best next step. Then LEFT to (5,5) in the following move. This path avoids the enemy and efficiently reaches the apple.\n\nPotential risks: After moving DOWN, check if the enemy snake could block the path. Currently, they are at (4,3) and moving towards (4,4) might not interfere. \n\nFinal decision: Move DOWN to (5,6), setting up for the apple at (5,5).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The next position (5,5) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (3,3), so they're not near (5,5). Safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,6). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,6). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is directly below me.

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (5,5) now because the last move was DOWN to (5,5) where there was an apple. The body is [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] plus the new segment from eating the apple, so the full body should be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. The body would be [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. From (4,4), possible moves would be LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) is now part of the body). So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial. So moving DOWN seems optimal. \n\nCheck for any risks: enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP (3,3) which is their own body, DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT (4,2). They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice. It's safe and gains a point. \n\nNext, after eating, plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The available apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with body [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (4,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,5). But (4,5) is part of my own body (the first segment). Collision with self. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is elsewhere. The enemy snake's body includes (3,3), but (4,3) is empty. So this seems safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,4). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,4). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is three steps right and one down from (4,4). The apple at (0,5) is far left. The others are at the edges. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,4), I can start heading towards (7,3). Moving DOWN to (4,3) might get me closer to (7,3) as well. LEFT to (3,4) doesn't directly lead to an apple but could be a safer path.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Their head is at (2,1). Their possible moves could be UP to (2,2) (which is part of their body), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). They might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nPrioritize getting apples. Moving RIGHT towards (7,3) seems strategic. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could set up a path towards (7,3) by then moving right. Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Their possible moves might be towards the apples at (0,5) or (8,0), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,3), I can head towards (7,3) directly. If I move RIGHT to (6,4), I can either go towards (7,3) or (9,4). \n\nBut moving DOWN to (5,3) seems more efficient for reaching (7,3).

Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (6,4). Check if that's safe. Looking at the board state, the snake's body is at [(5,3), (5,4), ...]. (5,4) is part of the body, but (6,4) isn't listed. Wait, the current body is [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is empty. But wait, the board shows that at row 3 (y=3?), there's a '2' at (6,3). The board's Y-axis might be inverted since (0,0) is bottom left. Let me confirm the coordinates. The board's Y increases upwards, so row 0 is the bottom. So (6,3) is in the 4th row from the bottom (since y=0 is bottom). Moving UP would be to y=4. Checking the board state, in row 4 (y=4), there's a 'T' at (4,4) and (5,4) which are part of my body. But (6,4) is not listed as a body part. So moving UP to (6,4) is safe? Wait, the body segments are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is not part of the body. So UP is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (6,2). Check if that's safe. The board shows at (6,2) there's no snake or obstacle. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (5,3). But (5,3) is part of my body. So that's a collision. Can't go LEFT.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (7,3). There's an apple at (7,3). If I move here, I'll eat the apple and grow. That's good. But need to check if the path is safe. (7,3) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (4,0), so they're far away. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is directly to the RIGHT. Eating that would give a point. So moving RIGHT is the most direct way to get an apple. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,3), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. After eating, the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still at (5,5). So moving RIGHT again would be possible if there's a path. But first, let's focus on this move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,4) might lead towards the apple at (9,4) but that's further away.

The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (7,9) at the top right, (0,5) on the left, and (8,0) at the bottom right. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), that's moving towards the right edge where apples (9,4) and (9,2) are. Alternatively, moving UP towards (7,4) could lead towards (7,9) but that's a long path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) could head towards (9,2). \n\nBut let's check if there's an apple in the immediate path. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are two steps away from (8,3) and (7,2) respectively. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't get an apple immediately. Moving UP to (7,4) also doesn't. The next apple in that direction would require more steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (7,9) which is at the top right. From (7,3), moving UP several times would get there, but that's a long path. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy is at (5,0), which is far from my current position. They might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the immediate options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe. \n\nWhich direction is safest and leads towards an apple? Let's think:\n\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving towards the right edge. From there, next moves could be UP to (8,4) towards (9,4) or DOWN to (8,2) towards (9,2). Both are possible. \n\n- **UP (7,4)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,4) or continue UP. \n\n- **DOWN (7,2)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,2) or further DOWN. \n\nSince the apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are on the right edge, moving RIGHT now positions me closer to both. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't immediately get an apple. But it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) might allow me to then move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4). That's two moves to get the apple. Similarly, moving DOWN to (7,2) and then RIGHT to (8,2), then to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), the next move would be to (9,3) if I go RIGHT again, but (9,3) is not an apple. To reach (9,4), I need to go UP from (8,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) and then RIGHT to (8,4), then UP to (9,4). That path seems possible. \n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't box myself in. Let's also check the current body. After moving RIGHT to (8,3), the new body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail is at (5,5), so there's space behind. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) to approach the apple at (9,2). From (7,2), moving RIGHT twice to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is less risky? Let's think about possible obstacles. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are on the lower left. They might be moving towards (8,0) or (0,5). But their path doesn't intersect mine immediately. \n\nSo, the safest immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are both two moves away. Moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows flexibility to go UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN now could set a direction towards those apples. \n\nBut since there's no immediate apple in the current direction, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is a neutral move that keeps options open. \n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP from (7,3) to (7,4), then continue UP towards (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards (7,9). But that's six moves up. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Also three moves. \n\nHmm. Both paths take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it positions me closer to both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now could start the ascent towards (7,9). \n\nBut (7,9) is quite far. Maybe prioritize the closer apples first. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom right. If I move DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2), then further DOWN to (7,1), etc., but that's moving away from most apples. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the best options are to move towards the right edge apples. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a good step towards (9,4) or (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut which is safer? Let's check the board again. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 4 (y=4) has T (my body) at (4,4) and (5,4). The apple at (9,4) is in row 4. \n\nRow 2 (y=2) has an apple at (9,2). \n\nSo moving RIGHT to (8,3) is in row 3. Then, from (8,3), moving UP to (8,4) (row 4) would be safe if there's no obstacle. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) (row 4), which is safe. \n\nBut in both cases, the next move would need to check for body parts. \n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT back to (7,3) because that's the body. So after moving RIGHT, the next options would be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. \n\nSimilarly, moving UP to (7,4) would allow next moves UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. \n\nBut since the goal is to reach the apples, moving RIGHT seems better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to start the path upwards. \n\nBut without immediate apple in that direction, perhaps moving RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother point: the apple at (7,9) is at the top right. If I can reach that, it's a high-value target, but it's far. However, moving UP now might not be the most efficient. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) to get that apple. \n\nBut (9,3) is not an apple, so that's an extra step. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Same number of steps. \n\nSo both paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first gives more flexibility. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might avoid potential collisions. \n\nWait, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The next move to (8,3) would leave the tail at (5,5), so the body is growing. \n\nBut since I just ate an apple in the last move, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows by one segment. So after moving to (7,3) (the apple), the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] plus the new head. Wait, no: the head moves to (7,3), and the body follows. So the body after eating the apple would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When you move, the head moves forward, and the tail follows unless you ate an apple. \n\nWait, the rules state that if you move onto an apple, you grow. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. \n\nSo after eating the apple at (7,3), the snake's body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nOriginal body before moving: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The head was at (6,3). Then moved RIGHT to (7,3), eating the apple. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. Because when you eat an apple, you add a new head and the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The snake moves: head moves to new position, each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't shorten, so the body grows by one. \n\nSo original length was 6 segments (head + 5 body parts). After eating an apple, the length becomes 7. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. If the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body increases by one segment. \n\nSo before the move, the body was [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] (head at (6,3), then the next segments). After moving RIGHT to (7,3) and eating the apple, the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, that would be adding a new head and keeping the tail. So the tail is now (5,5), but the body segments are the previous ones plus the new head. \n\nWait, perhaps the body after eating is [new head] + previous body without cutting the tail. So the length increases by one. \n\nSo in this case, after moving to (7,3), the body becomes [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still (5,5), but the body is longer. \n\nTherefore, in the current state, the snake's body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. \n\nSo when considering possible moves, the body includes (7,3) as the head, followed by (6,3), (5,3), etc. \n\nSo moving LEFT to (6,3) would collide with the next body segment. Hence, LEFT is unsafe. \n\nNow, back to the current possible moves. \n\nIf I move UP to (7,4), that's safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, two moves after the first to reach the apple. \n\nBut moving UP now might be better to start the ascent. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (8,3) keeps options open for both UP and DOWN next. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,2) is two moves down from (8,3). So moving RIGHT to (8,3), then DOWN to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nBut that's also possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT gives flexibility to go either UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) allows moving RIGHT towards (9,4). \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are far away. The main danger is my own body. \n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT, but can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT again to (9,3), which is safe. Then UP to (9,4) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, it's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nBoth paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it positions me closer to both apples (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might be safer if there's a potential collision in the right direction. \n\nBut there's no indication of that. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), I could move UP to (8,4), then continue UP towards (8,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nGiven the options, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a solid choice to position towards both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) to head towards (9,2). \n\nBut moving DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2) is safe. Then next move RIGHT to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nThat's two moves after DOWN to reach the apple. \n\nSo comparing the two options: moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows access to both (9,4) and (9,2) in two moves, while moving DOWN to (7,2) focuses on (9,2). \n\nWhich apple is closer? Both are two moves away from their respective paths. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (9,4) is more accessible from (8,3) than (9,2) from (7,2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,2) is shorter. \n\nBut without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother factor: the apple at (9,4) is in row 4, which is where part of my body is. But that's the tail end. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is in row 2, which is clear. \n\nBut both are viable. \n\nGiven that, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is the best choice to keep options open. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut I need to decide based on current safety and potential growth. \n\nSince all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe, the best move is to head towards the nearest apple. \n\nBut which apple is nearest? \n\nThe apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nThe apple at (9,2) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. \n\nThe apple at (7,9) is six moves up. \n\nThe apple at (8,0) is far down and right. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but blocked. \n\nSo the closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nSince moving RIGHT allows me to choose between them next, that's the best option. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (8,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The apples are still at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9).

Let's check each:\n\n1. **UP (8,4)**: Is this safe? The board shows no snakes there. My body segments are [(7,3), (6,3), etc.]. (8,4) isn't part of my body. Valid move.\n\n2. **DOWN (8,2)**: Also safe. No obstacles mentioned. \n\n3. **LEFT (7,3)**: That's part of my body (the first segment after the head). Moving LEFT would collide. Unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9,3)**: Within the board. No apple there, but safe unless another snake is present. The enemy snake is far away. Valid.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest are (9,4) and (9,2). Moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4) gets closer to (9,4). Next move could be RIGHT to (9,4). Moving DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2). Moving RIGHT to (9,3) doesn't get an apple but positions for future moves.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's think:\n\n- **UP to (8,4)**: One step closer to (9,4). Next move RIGHT to (9,4) would eat the apple. That's efficient.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,2)**: Next move RIGHT to (9,2) for the apple. Also efficient.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,3)**: Then UP to (9,4) or DOWN to (9,2). Adds an extra step but keeps options open.\n\nSince both apples are equally reachable in two moves, but moving UP or DOWN now directly targets one. Which apple is safer? The enemy snake is at (6,0), so they might be heading towards (8,0) or (0,5). Not a threat here.\n\nIf I go UP to (8,4), next move RIGHT to (9,4) gets the apple. That's good. Similarly, DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2). Both are viable. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3) allows me to choose between UP or DOWN next. But that adds a step. \n\nSince the goal is to collect apples quickly, moving UP or DOWN now is better. \n\nWhich apple to prioritize? (9,4) is in the same column as my current position if I move UP. (9,2) is two steps down and right. \n\nBut both are equally distant. Maybe choose the one with fewer obstacles. Looking at the board, (9,4) is in row 4, which has some of my body segments (like (4,4), (5,4)), but those are far away. The path to (9,4) from (8,4) is clear. \n\nSimilarly, (9,2) is in row 2, which seems clear. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that's more in line with current direction. Since I moved RIGHT last time, continuing towards the right edge makes sense. \n\nBut to get the apple, moving UP now to (8,4) then RIGHT is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3) might risk getting stuck if there's no apple. \n\nSo the best move is UP to (8,4) to head towards (9,4). \n\nWait, but after moving UP to (8,4), the next move would be RIGHT to (9,4), which is the apple. That's two moves total. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) is also two moves. \n\nBut moving UP now is more direct. \n\nYes, moving UP to (8,4) is better. \n\nSo the next move should be UP.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The apples are located at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), and (7,9). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7,0) with a body that doesn't seem to be in my immediate path.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (8,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (8,5)**: This is within the 10x10 grid. Checking the board state, there's no immediate obstacle mentioned here. However, looking at the provided board diagram, row 5 has an apple at (0,5) but that's far. The path up from (8,4) to (8,5) seems clear. No body parts or enemy snakes are there. Safe move.\n\n2. **DOWN (8,3)**: This is the previous position of the snake's head. Since the body segments include (8,3), moving down would collide with my own body. That's a death move. Avoid.\n\n3. **LEFT (7,4)**: Checking the board, (7,4) isn't listed as part of my body or the enemy's. The enemy snake is at (7,0), so this position should be safe. Moving left here could be a way to navigate towards the apple at (7,9) but that's quite a distance. However, immediate safety is okay.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9,4)**: This is the position of one of the apples. Moving right here would collect the apple at (9,4), grow the snake, and gain a point. The position (9,4) is within the grid, and there's no mention of another snake or obstacle there. This seems like the optimal move to score immediately.\n\nConsidering the goal is to collect apples and avoid collisions, moving RIGHT to (9,4) is the best choice. It directly gains a point and grows the snake. The other moves either risk collision (DOWN) or don't immediately collect an apple (UP, LEFT). \n\nAdditionally, after collecting (9,4), the next closest apple would be (9,2) or (7,9). Planning ahead, moving towards (9,2) after collecting (9,4) might be strategic, but for the current move, RIGHT is the clear choice.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (2,9), and my body is empty, so I'm just the head right now. The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately. So I can start moving right.\n\nSo the direction should be RIGHT. That's the safest and most direct path to an apple.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the closest apple at (9,9), I'll start moving RIGHT towards it. This path is clear of immediate threats and the enemy snake at (3,7) isn't in the way. \n\nStrategy next turn: Continue moving RIGHT towards (9,9) while checking for enemy movements.\n\nDirection: RIGHT"

The apples are still at (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). The enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with an empty body. Wait, in the previous state, the enemy was at (3,7), but now they're at (3,6). So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2). So they might not be a threat to my path towards (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,8) could allow me to approach the apple at (8,7). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. But the enemy is at (3,6), which is two rows below (3,8). If they move up, they could reach (3,7) or (3,8), but that's speculative. However, moving towards (8,7) would require navigating around the enemy's possible path, which might be riskier.\n\nSticking to the original plan of moving RIGHT towards (9,9) seems safer.

UP would go to (4,10), which is out of bounds. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nMy goal is to reach the apple at (9,9). Moving RIGHT each time would get me closer. From (4,9), moving RIGHT to (5,9), then (6,9), etc., all the way to (9,9). That seems straightforward. Are there any obstacles?\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5). They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path. But since they're at (3,5), moving towards me would require several moves. I don't see an immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step. From (4,9) to (5,9): no snakes there. Then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). All those positions are empty except (9,9) which has the apple. So the path is clear. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is far away. They might be moving towards other apples, like (5,0) or (9,2), but that's not my concern right now.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. Also, moving down would take me away from the current apple.

The other positions on row 9 (from x=5 to x=9) are empty except for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away and not in the path. Since their body is empty, they can't block unless they move into the path, but that's unlikely given their current position.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (5,8) might lead towards the apple at (8,7), but that's a longer path. The apple at (9,9) is the closest in terms of steps. Also, moving DOWN would take the snake away from the current path towards (9,9), which might not be efficient.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) would be moving back towards the previous position, which isn't helpful unless avoiding a threat.

Since the board is 10x10, (9,9) is the maximum coordinate. No risk of going out of bounds when moving to (9,9).\n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to continue the path towards the apple at (9,9).\n</think>\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT  \n**Strategy:** Continue moving RIGHT along the top row to efficiently reach the apple at (9,9).

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (9,9) with the body part at (8,9). So the head is at (9,9), and the tail is at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), and (7,7). The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (3,0) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment.\n\nLooking at the board state, the grid shows that (9,9) is where my snake's head is. The last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,9) to (9,9), probably eating the apple that was there. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the apples listed include (9,9)? Wait, no, the apples listed are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal apples: (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) isn't an apple. Wait, but in the board state, the 9th row (top row) shows at (9,9) as '2' which is my snake's head. So maybe the apple at (9,9) was already eaten in the last move. Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN. Therefore, the next move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (9,8) with the body at [(9,9)]. So the head is at (9,8), and the tail is at (9,9). The apples available are (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). The enemy snake is at (4,0) with an empty body.\n\nLooking at the board, the snake can move in three directions: LEFT to (8,8), DOWN to (9,7), or RIGHT which is off the board (invalid). UP would go to (9,9), which is the tail. Wait, the body is [(9,9)], which is the tail. So moving UP to (9,9) would collide with the tail. But in some Snake games, moving into the tail is allowed if the tail is moving forward. Wait, but according to the rules, running into yourself (including your own body) causes death. So if the snake's body is at (9,9), and the head is at (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) would hit the body part. So that's a collision. So possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (invalid). So LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7).\n\nNow, looking for apples. The closest apples are (8,7) and (9,4), (9,2). Let's see. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) doesn't get an apple, but then from (9,7), moving LEFT to (8,7) would get the apple. So either path requires two moves to reach (8,7). Alternatively, maybe going for the apples at (9,4) or (9,2) which are in the same column. If I move DOWN to (9,7), then continue DOWN to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. But moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down again to (9,6), etc. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,0), which is far away. So the path down the rightmost column seems clear. However, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7) is safe. Then from (9,7), moving down to (9,6), and so on until reaching (9,4). But each step would require moving down, and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is 2 (head at (9,8), tail at (9,9)), after moving down to (9,7), the tail would move to (9,8), so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (7,7) with the body segments at [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

So (7,8) is empty. So from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8) is safe. Then continue right towards (9,4). But that's a longer path. Maybe not the best option.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. So moving LEFT to (5,7) is a good step. Let's check if that's safe. Yes, (5,7) is empty. Then next move would be DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That path seems viable.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) and then LEFT towards (5,6) and (5,5). Which path is shorter? Both take two moves after the first step.

But their current position is (4,2), body at (4,1) and (5,1). So they might be moving up or left.

The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no. If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nFrom (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe, then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first allows for more options. For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple. From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3), but that's getting into enemy territory. \n\nAlternatively, after getting (4,4), maybe head towards (2,2). \n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the nearest apple first. \n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT to (4,5) to set up for the apple at (4,4) next turn. \n\nBut wait, if I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4) next turn. \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it positions the snake closer to other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might avoid potential obstacles. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nSo the next move is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Wait, no, the problem states that after the last move (LEFT), the snake's position is (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. So the head is at (4,5), and the body follows. The apples available are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (0,5), (7,3). \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,5). The directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: (4,6). Check if this is safe. The board shows no snakes or walls here. The body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. (4,6) isn't part of the body. So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. The body would be [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. From (4,4), possible moves would be LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) is now part of the body). So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial. So moving DOWN seems optimal. \n\nCheck for any risks: enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP (3,3) which is their own body, DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT (4,2). They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice. It's safe and gains a point. \n\nNext, after eating, plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The available apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with body [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (4,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,5). But (4,5) is part of my own body (the first segment). Collision with self. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is elsewhere. The enemy snake's body includes (3,3), but (4,3) is empty. So this seems safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,4). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,4). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is three steps right and one down from (4,4). The apple at (0,5) is far left. The others are at the edges. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,4), I can start heading towards (7,3). Moving DOWN to (4,3) might get me closer to (7,3) as well. LEFT to (3,4) doesn't directly lead to an apple but could be a safer path.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Their head is at (2,1). Their possible moves could be UP to (2,2) (which is part of their body), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). They might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nPrioritize getting apples. Moving RIGHT towards (7,3) seems strategic. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could set up a path towards (7,3) by then moving right. Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

Their possible moves might be towards the apples at (0,5) or (8,0), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,3), I can head towards (7,3) directly. If I move RIGHT to (6,4), I can either go towards (7,3) or (9,4). \n\nBut moving DOWN to (5,3) seems more efficient for reaching (7,3).

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3,0) with body [(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the head position (5,3). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,4). But (5,4) is part of my body. Collision. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,2). Check the board. The position (5,2) is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,3). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,3). The apple at (7,3) is nearby. Position (6,3) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3). From (5,3), moving RIGHT to (6,3) would get me closer. Then, another RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (4,3) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's further away. Moving DOWN to (5,2) could explore the lower area, but there's an apple at (9,2) which is far.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,0). Their body is along (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). They might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). Since they're on the left side, moving RIGHT towards (7,3) might avoid them.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,3), next move can be RIGHT again to (7,3) to get the apple. This path is direct and efficient. Moving LEFT to (4,3) could lead towards (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk collision with the enemy if they move upwards. Moving DOWN to (5,2) doesn't immediately lead to an apple but could explore other areas.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT to (6,3), the body will follow. The new body would be [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail (5,6) is removed. No collision here. Similarly, moving LEFT or DOWN would also be safe.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (7,3), moving RIGHT is the best option. It's a direct path and minimizes the number of moves needed to reach the apple. \n\nAdditionally, the apple at (9,4) is further right, so after collecting (7,3), heading towards (9,4) could be the next target. However, the enemy's position isn't an immediate threat here. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is RIGHT to (6,3) to approach the apple at (7,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (4,0) with body [(3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check the possible moves from my head position (6,3). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (6,4). Check if that's safe. Looking at the board state, the snake's body is at [(5,3), (5,4), ...]. (5,4) is part of the body, but (6,4) isn't listed. Wait, the current body is [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is empty. But wait, the board shows that at row 3 (y=3?), there's a '2' at (6,3). The board's Y-axis might be inverted since (0,0) is bottom left. Let me confirm the coordinates. The board's Y increases upwards, so row 0 is the bottom. So (6,3) is in the 4th row from the bottom (since y=0 is bottom). Moving UP would be to y=4. Checking the board state, in row 4 (y=4), there's a 'T' at (4,4) and (5,4) which are part of my body. But (6,4) is not listed as a body part. So moving UP to (6,4) is safe? Wait, the body segments are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (6,4) is not part of the body. So UP is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (6,2). Check if that's safe. The board shows at (6,2) there's no snake or obstacle. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (5,3). But (5,3) is part of my body. So that's a collision. Can't go LEFT.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (7,3). There's an apple at (7,3). If I move here, I'll eat the apple and grow. That's good. But need to check if the path is safe. (7,3) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (4,0), so they're far away. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is directly to the RIGHT. Eating that would give a point. So moving RIGHT is the most direct way to get an apple. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,3), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. After eating, the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still at (5,5). So moving RIGHT again would be possible if there's a path. But first, let's focus on this move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,4) might lead towards the apple at (9,4) but that's further away. Moving DOWN to (6,2) could lead towards the apple at (9,2) but also far. The apple at (8,0) is even further down. The apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body.\n\nSo the best immediate gain is moving RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's a point and growth. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions with enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,0) with body [(3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]. They are on the lower left. Their head is at (4,0), so they might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are far from my current position. So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's safe and gains a point.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (5,0) with body [(4,0), (3,0), (2,0)]. The board shows that my head is at (7,3), and the last move was RIGHT, which probably moved me from (6,3) to (7,3), eating the apple there. Now, after eating, my body has grown, so the next move needs to account for that.\n\nPossible moves from (7,3) are UP (to 7,4), DOWN (to 7,2), LEFT (to 6,3), or RIGHT (to 8,3). Let's check each direction:\n\n1. **UP (7,4)**: Check if this cell is safe. The board state shows that at (7,4), there's nothing mentioned. The enemy snake is far away. My own body segments are [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. (7,4) isn't part of my body. So moving UP is safe unless there's a wall. Since y=4 is within 0-9, it's valid. So UP is possible.\n\n2. **DOWN (7,2)**: Check safety. The board shows (7,2) is empty. No snakes there. Valid move.\n\n3. **LEFT (6,3)**: This is the previous position of the head, which is now part of the body. So moving LEFT would collide with (6,3), which is part of my body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Check if (8,3) is safe. The board shows an apple at (8,0), but (8,3) isn't listed as having an apple or a snake. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (7,9) at the top right, (0,5) on the left, and (8,0) at the bottom right. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), that's moving towards the right edge where apples (9,4) and (9,2) are. Alternatively, moving UP towards (7,4) could lead towards (7,9) but that's a long path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) could head towards (9,2). \n\nBut let's check if there's an apple in the immediate path. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are two steps away from (8,3) and (7,2) respectively. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't get an apple immediately. Moving UP to (7,4) also doesn't. The next apple in that direction would require more steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (7,9) which is at the top right. From (7,3), moving UP several times would get there, but that's a long path. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy is at (5,0), which is far from my current position. They might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the immediate options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe. \n\nWhich direction is safest and leads towards an apple? Let's think:\n\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving towards the right edge. From there, next moves could be UP to (8,4) towards (9,4) or DOWN to (8,2) towards (9,2). Both are possible. \n\n- **UP (7,4)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,4) or continue UP. \n\n- **DOWN (7,2)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,2) or further DOWN. \n\nSince the apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are on the right edge, moving RIGHT now positions me closer to both. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't immediately get an apple. But it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) might allow me to then move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4). That's two moves to get the apple. Similarly, moving DOWN to (7,2) and then RIGHT to (8,2), then to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), the next move would be to (9,3) if I go RIGHT again, but (9,3) is not an apple. To reach (9,4), I need to go UP from (8,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) and then RIGHT to (8,4), then UP to (9,4). That path seems possible. \n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't box myself in. Let's also check the current body. After moving RIGHT to (8,3), the new body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail is at (5,5), so there's space behind. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) to approach the apple at (9,2). From (7,2), moving RIGHT twice to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is less risky? Let's think about possible obstacles. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are on the lower left. They might be moving towards (8,0) or (0,5). But their path doesn't intersect mine immediately. \n\nSo, the safest immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are both two moves away. Moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows flexibility to go UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN now could set a direction towards those apples. \n\nBut since there's no immediate apple in the current direction, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is a neutral move that keeps options open. \n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP from (7,3) to (7,4), then continue UP towards (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards (7,9). But that's six moves up. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Also three moves. \n\nHmm. Both paths take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it positions me closer to both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now could start the ascent towards (7,9). \n\nBut (7,9) is quite far. Maybe prioritize the closer apples first. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom right. If I move DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2), then further DOWN to (7,1), etc., but that's moving away from most apples. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the best options are to move towards the right edge apples. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a good step towards (9,4) or (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut which is safer? Let's check the board again. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 4 (y=4) has T (my body) at (4,4) and (5,4). The apple at (9,4) is in row 4. \n\nRow 2 (y=2) has an apple at (9,2). \n\nSo moving RIGHT to (8,3) is in row 3. Then, from (8,3), moving UP to (8,4) (row 4) would be safe if there's no obstacle. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) (row 4), which is safe. \n\nBut in both cases, the next move would need to check for body parts. \n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT back to (7,3) because that's the body. So after moving RIGHT, the next options would be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. \n\nSimilarly, moving UP to (7,4) would allow next moves UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. \n\nBut since the goal is to reach the apples, moving RIGHT seems better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to start the path upwards. \n\nBut without immediate apple in that direction, perhaps moving RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother point: the apple at (7,9) is at the top right. If I can reach that, it's a high-value target, but it's far. However, moving UP now might not be the most efficient. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) to get that apple. \n\nBut (9,3) is not an apple, so that's an extra step. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Same number of steps. \n\nSo both paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first gives more flexibility. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might avoid potential collisions. \n\nWait, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The next move to (8,3) would leave the tail at (5,5), so the body is growing. \n\nBut since I just ate an apple in the last move, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows by one segment. So after moving to (7,3) (the apple), the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] plus the new head. Wait, no: the head moves to (7,3), and the body follows. So the body after eating the apple would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When you move, the head moves forward, and the tail follows unless you ate an apple. \n\nWait, the rules state that if you move onto an apple, you grow. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. \n\nSo after eating the apple at (7,3), the snake's body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nOriginal body before moving: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The head was at (6,3). Then moved RIGHT to (7,3), eating the apple. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. Because when you eat an apple, you add a new head and the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The snake moves: head moves to new position, each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't shorten, so the body grows by one. \n\nSo original length was 6 segments (head + 5 body parts). After eating an apple, the length becomes 7. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. If the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body increases by one segment. \n\nSo before the move, the body was [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] (head at (6,3), then the next segments). After moving RIGHT to (7,3) and eating the apple, the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, that would be adding a new head and keeping the tail. So the tail is now (5,5), but the body segments are the previous ones plus the new head. \n\nWait, perhaps the body after eating is [new head] + previous body without cutting the tail. So the length increases by one. \n\nSo in this case, after moving to (7,3), the body becomes [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still (5,5), but the body is longer. \n\nTherefore, in the current state, the snake's body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. \n\nSo when considering possible moves, the body includes (7,3) as the head, followed by (6,3), (5,3), etc. \n\nSo moving LEFT to (6,3) would collide with the next body segment. Hence, LEFT is unsafe. \n\nNow, back to the current possible moves. \n\nIf I move UP to (7,4), that's safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, two moves after the first to reach the apple. \n\nBut moving UP now might be better to start the ascent. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (8,3) keeps options open for both UP and DOWN next. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,2) is two moves down from (8,3). So moving RIGHT to (8,3), then DOWN to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nBut that's also possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT gives flexibility to go either UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) allows moving RIGHT towards (9,4). \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are far away. The main danger is my own body. \n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT, but can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT again to (9,3), which is safe. Then UP to (9,4) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, it's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nBoth paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it positions me closer to both apples (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might be safer if there's a potential collision in the right direction. \n\nBut there's no indication of that. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), I could move UP to (8,4), then continue UP towards (8,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nGiven the options, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a solid choice to position towards both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) to head towards (9,2). \n\nBut moving DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2) is safe. Then next move RIGHT to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nThat's two moves after DOWN to reach the apple. \n\nSo comparing the two options: moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows access to both (9,4) and (9,2) in two moves, while moving DOWN to (7,2) focuses on (9,2). \n\nWhich apple is closer? Both are two moves away from their respective paths. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (9,4) is more accessible from (8,3) than (9,2) from (7,2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,2) is shorter. \n\nBut without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother factor: the apple at (9,4) is in row 4, which is where part of my body is. But that's the tail end. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is in row 2, which is clear. \n\nBut both are viable. \n\nGiven that, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is the best choice to keep options open. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut I need to decide based on current safety and potential growth. \n\nSince all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe, the best move is to head towards the nearest apple. \n\nBut which apple is nearest? \n\nThe apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nThe apple at (9,2) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. \n\nThe apple at (7,9) is six moves up. \n\nThe apple at (8,0) is far down and right. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but blocked. \n\nSo the closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nSince moving RIGHT allows me to choose between them next, that's the best option. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (8,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (8,3) now, right? Because the last move was RIGHT from (7,3) to (8,3). The body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The apples are still at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9). The enemy snake is at (6,0) with body [(5,0), (4,0), (3,0)].\n\nPossible moves from (8,3) are UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3), or RIGHT to (9,3). Let's check each:\n\n1. **UP (8,4)**: Is this safe? The board shows no snakes there. My body segments are [(7,3), (6,3), etc.]. (8,4) isn't part of my body. Valid move.\n\n2. **DOWN (8,2)**: Also safe. No obstacles mentioned. \n\n3. **LEFT (7,3)**: That's part of my body (the first segment after the head). Moving LEFT would collide. Unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9,3)**: Within the board. No apple there, but safe unless another snake is present. The enemy snake is far away. Valid.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest are (9,4) and (9,2). Moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4) gets closer to (9,4). Next move could be RIGHT to (9,4). Moving DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2). Moving RIGHT to (9,3) doesn't get an apple but positions for future moves.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's think:\n\n- **UP to (8,4)**: One step closer to (9,4). Next move RIGHT to (9,4) would eat the apple. That's efficient.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,2)**: Next move RIGHT to (9,2) for the apple. Also efficient.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,3)**: Then UP to (9,4) or DOWN to (9,2). Adds an extra step but keeps options open.\n\nSince both apples are equally reachable in two moves, but moving UP or DOWN now directly targets one. Which apple is safer? The enemy snake is at (6,0), so they might be heading towards (8,0) or (0,5). Not a threat here.\n\nIf I go UP to (8,4), next move RIGHT to (9,4) gets the apple. That's good. Similarly, DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2). Both are viable. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3) allows me to choose between UP or DOWN next. But that adds a step. \n\nSince the goal is to collect apples quickly, moving UP or DOWN now is better. \n\nWhich apple to prioritize? (9,4) is in the same column as my current position if I move UP. (9,2) is two steps down and right. \n\nBut both are equally distant. Maybe choose the one with fewer obstacles. Looking at the board, (9,4) is in row 4, which has some of my body segments (like (4,4), (5,4)), but those are far away. The path to (9,4) from (8,4) is clear. \n\nSimilarly, (9,2) is in row 2, which seems clear. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that's more in line with current direction. Since I moved RIGHT last time, continuing towards the right edge makes sense. \n\nBut to get the apple, moving UP now to (8,4) then RIGHT is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3) might risk getting stuck if there's no apple. \n\nSo the best move is UP to (8,4) to head towards (9,4). \n\nWait, but after moving UP to (8,4), the next move would be RIGHT to (9,4), which is the apple. That's two moves total. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) is also two moves. \n\nBut moving UP now is more direct. \n\nYes, moving UP to (8,4) is better. \n\nSo the next move should be UP.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The apples are located at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), and (7,9). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7,0) with a body that doesn't seem to be in my immediate path.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (8,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (8,5)**: This is within the 10x10 grid. Checking the board state, there's no immediate obstacle mentioned here. However, looking at the provided board diagram, row 5 has an apple at (0,5) but that's far. The path up from (8,4) to (8,5) seems clear. No body parts or enemy snakes are there. Safe move.\n\n2. **DOWN (8,3)**: This is the previous position of the snake's head. Since the body segments include (8,3), moving down would collide with my own body. That's a death move. Avoid.\n\n3. **LEFT (7,4)**: Checking the board, (7,4) isn't listed as part of my body or the enemy's. The enemy snake is at (7,0), so this position should be safe. Moving left here could be a way to navigate towards the apple at (7,9) but that's quite a distance. However, immediate safety is okay.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9,4)**: This is the position of one of the apples. Moving right here would collect the apple at (9,4), grow the snake, and gain a point. The position (9,4) is within the grid, and there's no mention of another snake or obstacle there. This seems like the optimal move to score immediately.\n\nConsidering the goal is to collect apples and avoid collisions, moving RIGHT to (9,4) is the best choice. It directly gains a point and grows the snake. The other moves either risk collision (DOWN) or don't immediately collect an apple (UP, LEFT). \n\nAdditionally, after collecting (9,4), the next closest apple would be (9,2) or (7,9). Planning ahead, moving towards (9,2) after collecting (9,4) might be strategic, but for the current move, RIGHT is the clear choice.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

So the head moved from (8,4) to (9,4) in the last move. Now, the next move needs to decide where to go from (9,4).\n\nLooking at the apples available: (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9), (1,9). The apple at (9,2) is two steps down from the current position. The apple at (7,9) is up and to the left. The others are further away.\n\nPossible directions from (9,4) are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). But since the board is 10x10, x=9 is the rightmost column. So moving RIGHT to x=10 is invalid (out of bounds). So RIGHT is not possible. So available moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n1. **UP (9,5)**: Is there any obstacle? The board state shows at row 5 (y=5) there's an apple at (0,5), but that's not relevant here. The current position is (9,4). Moving up to (9,5) would be a new position. Checking the snake's body: the body segments are [(8,4), (8,3), ...]. So (9,5) isn't part of the body. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,1) with body [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0)], so no conflict here. So UP seems safe.\n\n2. **DOWN (9,3)**: Moving down to (9,3). Check if that's part of the body. The body includes (8,3), (7,3), etc., but (9,3) isn't listed. Also, no enemy snakes there. So DOWN is safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (8,4)**: Moving left to (8,4). But looking at the snake's body, the first segment after the head is (8,4). So moving left would collide with the body. That's a death. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or DOWN. Now, which is better strategically?\n\nIf I go UP to (9,5), that's moving away from the apple at (9,2). If I go DOWN to (9,3), then next move could go further down to (9,2) to get the apple. So moving DOWN now would set up to collect the apple at (9,2) in the next step. That seems better. Let me check the path:\n\nFrom (9,4) to (9,3) (DOWN), then next move to (9,2) (DOWN again) would collect the apple. But need to make sure that after moving DOWN to (9,3), the next move to (9,2) is possible. However, after moving DOWN to (9,3), the body would be [(9,4), (8,4), (8,3), ...]. So the next move to (9,2) would be safe unless there's an obstacle. The apple at (9,2) is present, so moving there would grow the snake. That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,5) might lead towards other apples, but the closest ones are (7,9) and (1,9). From (9,5), moving left towards (8,5), then up to (8,6), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,9) is at the top right, so moving up and left could be a way, but it's further away.\n\nSo the best immediate move is DOWN to (9,3), setting up to collect the apple at (9,2) next. That's a quick point gain. Also, need to check if moving DOWN now would cause any immediate collision. The current body after moving to (9,4) is [(8,4), (8,3), ...]. So (9,3) is not part of the body. So yes, safe.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The enemy snake is at (3,7). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move to get an apple without dying. Let's check possible moves from (2,9). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but (2,9) is at the top edge since y=9 is the highest. So moving UP (which increases y) would take me to y=10, which is outside the board. So UP is invalid. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current position is (2,9). Moving UP would be y+1, which is 10, out of bounds. So UP is a wall collision. So I can't go UP. So options are DOWN (y becomes 8), LEFT (x becomes 1), or RIGHT (x becomes 3).\n\nNow, check where the apples are. The closest apples are (8,7), (9,4), (9,9), (9,2), (5,0). Let's see which ones are reachable. (9,9) is at the top right corner. But I'm at (2,9), so same y-coordinate. To get to (9,9), I need to move right 7 times. But that's a long path. But maybe if I start moving right towards it. But there's also (9,2) which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to y=8, then maybe right towards x=8. But need to check the path. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,7). So if I go down to (2,8), then maybe right towards (3,8), (4,8), etc. But the enemy is at (3,7), which is one row below. So maybe not a direct collision risk yet.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,7) with body empty. So their head is at (3,7). If I move towards (8,7), which is at y=7, same as the enemy's current position. So maybe that's a risk if the enemy is moving towards that apple as well.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is at x=9, y=2. That's far down. To get there, I'd need to go down several times and right. But maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (5,0) is even further down, but that's at the bottom left. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then left to (1,8), etc., but that's not the direction towards (5,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,9) is right at the corner. If I can reach it, that's a quick way to get a point. But from (2,9), moving right would take me towards x=3,4,...9. So moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,9). Then next steps could be right again. But is there any obstacle? The enemy snake is at (3,7), which is two rows below. So moving right to (3,9) is safe. Then next move right to (4,9), etc. But the apple at (9,9) is at the same y. So if I can go right 7 times, I can reach it. But that's a long path. But since the snake's body is empty, each move just shifts the head. So if I go right each time, I can reach (9,9) in 7 moves, but need to check if any other snakes are in the way. The enemy snake is at (3,7), so their path might not interfere with mine. But maybe other apples are closer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. From (2,9), moving down to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,7) which is where the enemy is. Wait, enemy is at (3,7). So moving to (3,7) would collide with them. So that's dangerous. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go down to (2,8), then right to (3,8), then down to (3,7) (enemy's position), which is risky. So perhaps that's not a good idea.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. To get there, I need to go down 5 steps and right 7 steps. That's a long way. The apple at (9,2) is even further down. The apple at (5,0) is at x=5, y=0. That's the bottom row. To get there, I need to go down 9 steps and right 3 steps. But that's a long path, and maybe other snakes could be in the way.\n\nSo the closest apple seems to be (9,9), but it's 7 steps right. But moving right each time would take me there. However, since the enemy is at (3,7), maybe they are going for other apples. But if I start moving right now, I can start heading towards (9,9). Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Let's evaluate each.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), next move could be RIGHT again to (4,9), etc. But is there any apple along that path? The apple at (9,9) is at the end. So each step right gets me closer. But since the snake is just the head, moving right each time would be safe as long as no other snakes are in the way. The enemy is at (3,7), so their position is two rows below. So moving to (3,9) is safe. Then next move to (4,9), etc. So that path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would take me towards the apple at (8,7). But from (2,8), moving down again to (2,7), then right towards (8,7). But when I reach (3,7), the enemy is there. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), that's moving left, but there's no apple in that direction. The closest apple in that direction is (5,0), but that's far. So moving left would take me away from most apples.\n\nSo the best option seems to be moving RIGHT towards (9,9). But wait, the apple at (9,9) is present. So if I can reach it, I can grow. But the path is clear. So first move RIGHT to (3,9). Then next move RIGHT again, etc. So the first step is RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (3,7). Are they a threat? If they move up, they could reach (3,8), but I'm at (3,9) next turn. So maybe not an immediate threat. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) would allow me to go towards other apples, but the path to (8,7) is blocked by the enemy. So maybe not.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT towards (9,9). That's the closest apple in terms of steps needed. Also, since the enemy is at (3,7), they might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately.

So they moved DOWN to (3,6). Interesting.\n\nThe board's current state shows my snake at (3,9). The apples at (9,9) are still present. So moving RIGHT again would take me to (4,9), getting closer to (9,9). Let's check possible directions from (3,9). Possible moves: UP (y=10, invalid), DOWN (y=8), LEFT (x=2), RIGHT (x=4). So options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is now at (3,6). So they are three rows below me. If I move DOWN to (3,8), that's safe. But my goal is to reach (9,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) continues the path towards the apple. The enemy's position at (3,6) doesn't directly block my path. \n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see. The next position would be (4,9). Then, subsequent moves can continue right. The enemy's movement from (3,7) to (3,6) suggests they might be moving down, perhaps towards the apple at (5,0) or (9,2).

They're on the left side of the board, so probably not in my path towards (9,9). Their body is empty, so they can't block me unless they move into my path.

The apple at (8,7) is also on the right side but lower. But (9,9) is the closest in the x-direction. Since I'm already on row 9, moving right towards (9,9) is the quickest way to get an apple. Once I eat that, I'll grow, which might complicate future moves, but for now, getting the apple is priority.\n\nIs there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's check each step.

Because the user's last move was RIGHT to (9,9), which would have collected the apple if it was there. But according to the initial list, there's no apple at (9,9). Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state's 9th row (y=9) is: 9 . . . . . . . . T 2. Wait, the T is at (8,9) and 2 is at (9,9). So the snake's head is at (9,9), body at (8,9). The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,9) is not an apple. So the previous move to (9,9) didn't collect an apple. Wait, but why was the last move's rationale about getting an apple at (9,9)? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial problem setup. But according to the current apples listed, (9,9) isn't an apple. So moving to (9,9) didn't collect anything. So now, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). Now, possible moves are LEFT (to (8,9)), which is the body, so that's suicide. DOWN to (9,8), RIGHT is invalid (x=10), UP is y=10 which is invalid. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8). But wait, the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the available directions are DOWN. But wait, the head is at (9,9). Moving LEFT would go to (8,9), which is the body part. So that's a collision. So the only possible move is DOWN to (9,8). But is there an apple there? The apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (5,0), (7,7). So (9,8) isn't an apple. So moving down to (9,8) would just move the snake, but not collect any points. Then, next move would have to go further down to (9,7), which is an apple at (8,7) but that's at (8,7). Wait, (9,7) isn't an apple. The apple at (8,7) is at x=8, y=7. So from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) would get the apple. But that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the snake is stuck. Wait, but the snake can't move LEFT into its own body. So the only possible move is DOWN. So the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). But that's the only option. So the answer is DOWN. But why did the previous move go to (9,9) if there's no apple there? Maybe the initial setup had an apple at (9,9) that was already eaten. But according to the current apples listed, it's not there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But given the current information, the snake is at (9,9) with body at (8,9). The possible moves are DOWN to (9,8) or RIGHT (invalid), UP (invalid), LEFT (suicide). So the only valid move is DOWN.

So if the snake is length 2, moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the tail (originally at (9,9)) would move to (9,8). So the new body would be [(9,8)] and the head at (9,7). So the next move, if moving down again to (9,6), the tail would move to (9,7), and the body would be [(9,7)]. So the snake can safely move down the column as long as there's no collision. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column. So moving down towards them could be a plan. Alternatively, moving left towards (8,7) apple. Let's compare the steps. From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). Then next move DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. That would take two moves. But after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So after eating, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the body is [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8)], and then the tail stays, so the length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So for example, if the snake is length 2: head at (9,8), body at (9,9). Then moving LEFT to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then moving DOWN to (8,7) (which is an apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. So the snake is length 2. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body segments follow. The tail (9,9) moves to (9,8). So the new body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (if that's an apple), the head moves to (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's length becomes 3. So the body would be [(8,8), (9,8)], and the tail stays at (9,9) because the growth adds a new segment. Wait, maybe the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple. So normally, when you move, the tail moves forward. But if you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail (9,9) moves to (9,8), so the body is [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the tail is the last segment. Let me think of the snake as a list. Original snake: head at (9,8), body segments [(9,9)]. When moving LEFT to (8,8), the new head is (8,8), and the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the new head is (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (9,8)], and because you ate an apple, you add a new segment at the end. So the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, maybe the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail moves, it doesn't. So in the first move (LEFT to (8,8)), the tail moves from (9,9) to (9,8). Then, moving DOWN to (8,7) (apple), the tail would normally move from (9,8) to (8,8), but because you ate an apple, the tail stays, so the body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nThe immediate options are LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7). Let's evaluate both.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8). This position is empty (from the board state, at (8,8) there's a '.'). So moving there is safe. Then, next move could be DOWN to (8,7) which is an apple. That would allow growth. But need to ensure that path is safe. Alternatively, after moving LEFT, the snake's body is [(9,8)], so the next move can't go back to (9,8) (which is the body). So after moving LEFT to (8,8), the next move options would be UP (to (8,9)), DOWN (to (8,7)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8) which is body). So DOWN to (8,7) is the way to the apple. That seems good.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7). This position is also empty (from the board, at (9,7) there's a '.'). Then, next move could be DOWN to (9,6), and so on, aiming for the apples at (9,4) and (9,2). But each step down would require moving further, and the snake's body would follow. However, since the snake is currently length 2, moving down would leave the tail at (9,8), so the body would be [(9,8)] after moving to (9,7). Then, moving down again to (9,6), the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and so on. But to reach (9,4), that's four moves down from (9,8). Each move would require checking for safety. But since the snake is short, it's manageable.\n\nComparing the two options: Option 1 gets to an apple in two moves, while Option 2 requires more moves but collects apples further down. However, the apple at (8,7) is closer. Also, the apple at (9,4) and (9,2) are in the same column, which might be a longer path but could collect multiple apples if possible. However, the snake's current length is 2, so after eating an apple, it becomes 3, which makes maneuvering a bit trickier but manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. It might be moving towards the apple at (5,0). But since it's on the other side of the board, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best immediate move is to go for the closest apple. Option 1: LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) to get the apple. Which path is shorter? From (9,8):\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (8,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (8,7) (apple). Two moves.\n\nOption 2: DOWN to (9,7) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves. However, moving LEFT first might be safer because after moving to (8,8), the next move to (8,7) is directly into the apple. Whereas moving DOWN to (9,7) and then LEFT to (8,7) also reaches the apple. But which path has fewer risks?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), the next move is DOWN to (8,7) (apple). After eating, the snake's body would be longer, so the tail would stay, making the body segments [(8,8), (9,8)]. Then, the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) would also reach the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose DOWN first:\n\nCurrent position (9,8) \u2192 DOWN to (9,7). Then, next move LEFT to (8,7) (apple). That's two moves. After eating, the snake's body would be [(9,8), (9,7)] (since the tail was at (9,8) before eating, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)] plus the new segment? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal snake: head at (9,8), body at [(9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (9,7), the body becomes [(9,8)]. Then, moving LEFT to (8,7) (apple), the head moves there, body becomes [(9,7), (9,8)], and because an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? No, that's not right. When you eat an apple, you add a segment at the tail. So after moving to (8,7) and eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(9,7), (9,8)] and then add a new segment at the end, making it [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? But the tail was at (9,8) before eating. Hmm, perhaps the tail is extended. So after eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the next time the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (8,7), the body would be [(9,7), (9,8)], and the tail (originally at (9,8)) stays, so the body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]? I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate move.\n\nIn any case, both paths require two moves to reach the apple. However, moving LEFT first might be better because after eating the apple, the snake can then move in more directions. For example, from (8,7), the snake can go LEFT to (7,7) (another apple), but that's already listed as an apple at (7,7). Wait, yes, there's an apple at (7,7). So after eating the apple at (8,7), the next move could be LEFT to (7,7) to get another apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT first allows the snake to collect two apples in three moves: (9,8) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) (apple) \u2192 (7,7) (apple). That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,7) then LEFT to (8,7) (apple) and then LEFT to (7,7) (apple) would also work, but the path is similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it positions the snake closer to the next apple.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe, and then DOWN to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is also safe. Both options are valid. But which one is better in terms of future moves?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple), that's a good path. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7), then LEFT to (8,7) (apple), then LEFT to (7,7) (apple). Both paths are similar. However, moving LEFT first might be better because it starts moving away from the edge, giving more options. If the snake stays on the edge (rightmost column), it has fewer movement options. Moving towards the center gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up to collect the apple at (8,7) next. But wait, the current position is (9,8). Moving LEFT to (8,8) is valid. Then next move can be DOWN to (8,7) for the apple. That seems like a solid plan. So the immediate move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The available apples are at (8,7), (9,4), (9,2), (7,7), and (4,1). The enemy snake is at (5,0) with a body at [(4,0)], but they don't seem to be an immediate threat.\n\nPossible moves from (8,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). The board's top row is y=9, so this is valid. The current board shows row 9 as mostly empty. However, moving UP would take the snake to a new position. Need to check if there's any collision. The snake's body is at [(9,8)], so (8,9) is safe. But after moving UP, the next moves might be limited since it's the top edge.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). This is an apple! If I move here, the snake will grow by 1 point. The position (8,7) is currently marked as 'A' on the board. This seems like a direct path to gain a point. However, need to ensure that moving into the apple doesn't lead to a trap. After eating, the snake's body will extend, so future movements need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). The board shows this as empty ('.'). This is a safe move but doesn't immediately gain a point. However, it positions the snake closer to the apple at (7,7), which could be the next target.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). This is the current body position [(9,8)], so moving RIGHT would result in a collision with itself. This is invalid and would cause death.\n\nConsidering the options, moving DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple is the most advantageous as it directly increases the score. However, after eating, the snake's body will be [(8,8), (9,8)], so the next move must avoid backtracking into the body. For example, after eating, moving LEFT to (7,7) (another apple) would be possible, continuing the growth strategy.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) allows approaching the apple at (7,7) next turn. But this delays gaining a point. Since the primary goal is to collect apples efficiently, prioritizing the immediate apple at (8,7) is better.\n\nSafety check: Moving DOWN to (8,7) is valid, no enemy snakes or walls in that direction. The enemy snake is far away, so no collision risk there. The path is clear. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7) to consume the apple and grow the snake.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So this is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAlternative: If I move DOWN to (8,6), then next turn I can go towards other apples, but that delays getting the nearby apple. Since the apple at (7,7) is adjacent, it's better to take it now.\n\nSo the decision is to move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples available are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) with body parts at [(5,1), (5,0)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (7,7). Let's look at each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases to 8)**: Moving to (7,8). Check if this is occupied. The current body parts are [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)]. (7,8) isn't part of the body, so this seems safe. But is there an apple here? The listed apples don't include (7,8), so no.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases to 6)**: Moving to (7,6). This is empty. No apple here either. Safe but no gain.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases to 6)**: Moving to (6,7). Check for obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so no conflict here. No body parts in that cell. Safe. No apple here.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases to 8)**: Moving to (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide with itself. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now, which is best?\n\nLooking at apples nearby. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (4,4) and (2,2) on the left, and (5,5) in the middle. From (7,7), moving towards (5,5) might be a path. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could go LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. But that's a few moves away. Alternatively, moving UP to (7,8) could allow heading towards (9,4) or (9,2) by moving right. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) might lead towards the (4,4) apple if I go left and down. But again, not immediate.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. From (7,7), moving LEFT twice to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5), etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT towards the right edge apples. But moving RIGHT from (7,8) would go to (8,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the (5,5) apple. Let's plan a path. From (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But need to check if any of these steps are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,1), so their body is at (5,1) and (5,0). So moving towards (5,5) would not interfere with them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's own body. After moving LEFT to (6,7), the body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). Wait, but if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, the current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8)] with the head at (7,7). So after moving, the new head is at the new position, and the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT to (6,7), the new body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. The tail (9,8) is removed. So the snake's length remains 4 (head + 3 body parts). \n\nBut if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So the priority is to find an apple to eat to grow and gain points.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest ones are (5,5) and (4,4). From (7,7), moving LEFT towards (6,7) and then further left could approach (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) and then left towards (4,4). \n\nBut which path is more efficient? Let's check the distance. From (7,7) to (5,5): Manhattan distance is (7-5) + (7-5) = 4. To (4,4): (7-4)+(7-4)=6. To (9,4): (9-7)+(7-4)=2+3=5. To (9,2): (9-7)+(7-2)=2+5=7. So the closest apple is (5,5) at 4 steps, then (9,4) at 5 steps.\n\nBut (9,4) is on the right edge. To get there from (7,7), moving RIGHT is blocked by the body. So the path would require moving UP to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) (but that's part of the body), which is invalid. So that's not possible. So (9,4) is not reachable directly. \n\nSo the best bet is to go for (5,5). To get there, moving LEFT to (6,7) is a step in that direction. Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But each step needs to check for safety.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,6) then LEFT to (6,6), etc. But that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, is there an apple closer that I missed? The apples listed are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). So (5,5) is the closest in terms of steps.\n\nSo the immediate move should be towards (5,5). So from (7,7), moving LEFT to (6,7) is the first step. That's a safe move. No collision with self or enemy. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,7), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,6) to avoid potential obstacles. But why? Let's check the board state again. The board at (7,6) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't lead towards an apple immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,5). So direction LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The apples are still at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (5,5). The enemy snake is at (4,2) with body [(4,1), (5,1)].\n\nFirst, possible moves from (6,7):\n\n- UP: (6,8). Check if that's safe. The current body parts are [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. (6,8) isn't part of the body. No apple there. Safe.\n\n- DOWN: (6,6). Empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (5,7). Check if occupied. The enemy snake is at (4,2), so (5,7) is clear. Also, no body parts here. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (7,7). That's part of the snake's body (the first segment). So moving RIGHT would collide. Invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to an apple? The closest apples are (5,5) and (4,4). Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,7), moving LEFT to (5,7) would be a step towards (5,5). Then from (5,7), moving DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's two more moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,6) then LEFT to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,8) might allow heading towards the right-side apples, but those are further away. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are on the right edge, but moving right from (6,8) would require passing through (7,8), which is not part of the body now. Wait, the body is [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)]. So (7,8) is empty. So from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8) is safe. Then continue right towards (9,4). But that's a longer path. Maybe not the best option.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. So moving LEFT to (5,7) is a good step. Let's check if that's safe. Yes, (5,7) is empty. Then next move would be DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That path seems viable.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) and then LEFT towards (5,6) and (5,5). Which path is shorter? Both take two moves after the first step. But moving LEFT first might be better as it's a direct approach.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,2). They might be heading towards (4,4) or (2,2). But their current position is (4,2), body at (4,1) and (5,1). So they might be moving up or left. Not sure, but their path doesn't interfere with mine immediately.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT towards (5,7), getting closer to (5,5). That's the most efficient path to an apple.

The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,3) with body parts at [(4,2), (4,1)]. \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (5,7). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,8). Check if this is safe. The current body segments are [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7)], so (5,8) isn't part of the body. The board shows no obstacles here. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (5,6). This position is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,7). Check for collisions. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. No body parts here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,7). That's part of my own body (the first segment). Collision risk. Not safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNext, consider the closest apples. The apple at (5,5) is two moves away if I go DOWN then LEFT. The apple at (4,4) is also nearby. Let's plan a path:\n\n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: From there, moving DOWN to (4,6) and then LEFT to (4,5) would approach (4,4). Alternatively, moving DOWN directly towards (5,5) might be faster.\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Then LEFT to (5,5) would get the apple in two moves. This seems efficient.\n- **UP to (5,8)**: This might lead towards the apples on the right edge (9,4 or 9,2), but that's a longer path.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is the closest. Moving DOWN to (5,6) sets up a direct path to (5,5). However, moving LEFT to (4,7) could also be strategic for reaching (4,4) or (2,2). Need to weigh the options.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,3). If they move towards (4,4), they might take that apple. But since my snake is on the left side, moving towards (4,4) might lead to a collision. Alternatively, securing (5,5) first is safer.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,6) is the best next step. Then LEFT to (5,5) in the following move. This path avoids the enemy and efficiently reaches the apple.\n\nPotential risks: After moving DOWN, check if the enemy snake could block the path. Currently, they are at (4,3) and moving towards (4,4) might not interfere. \n\nFinal decision: Move DOWN to (5,6), setting up for the apple at (5,5).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The body is [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] plus the new segment from eating the apple, so the full body should be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is now at (5,5), and the body segments are the previous head followed by the previous body. So the body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, original body before moving was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. When the head moves DOWN to (5,5), the new body becomes [new head (5,5)] followed by the previous body except the tail doesn't drop because we ate an apple. So the body length increases by one. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So the snake is now 5 segments long.\n\nNow, the current position is (5,5). The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (5,6). But (5,6) is part of the body (second segment). Collision with self. So that's invalid.\n- **DOWN**: (5,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (5,4) is empty. No apples there. But need to check if any enemy snakes are there. The enemy snake #1 is at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their positions are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,4) is clear. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe.\n- **LEFT**: (4,5). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (6,5). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples available: (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). The closest apples are (4,4) and (0,5). Let's see:\n\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move could go DOWN to (4,4) to get that apple. That's two moves away.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move could go LEFT to (4,4) to get the apple. That's also two moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) might lead towards the apples on the right (9,4 or 9,2), but those are further away.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT multiple times would get there, but that's a long path. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves could be towards (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2). The apple at (2,2) is nearby, so they might head there. If they move towards (2,2), they could be competing for that apple. But that's not directly in my path.\n\nSo the best options are to go towards the nearest apples. Either (4,4) or (0,5). (4,4) is closer. Let's plan a path to (4,4). From (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). That would collect the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4). Either way, two moves. Which path is safer?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4). But after moving LEFT, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (since we ate an apple last turn, the length is now 5, so after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments). Wait, no. Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by 1. So previously, the body was [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 4). Then moving DOWN to (5,5) and eating the apple makes the body length 5. So the new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. Then moving LEFT to (4,5) would make the new head (4,5), and the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple this turn). Wait, no. When you move, the tail moves only if you didn't eat an apple. Since the last move was eating an apple, the tail didn't move. So after moving LEFT this turn, the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal body after eating the apple (last move) was [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)] (length 5). Now, when moving LEFT to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7) ] because the tail (7,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. When you move, you add the new head and remove the tail unless you ate an apple. Since this move (current turn) is not eating an apple (unless we move into an apple now), the tail is removed. But in this case, moving LEFT to (4,5) is not an apple. So the body would be [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (tail (7,7) is removed). So the length remains 5. So after moving LEFT, the body is 5 segments. Then next move, if we go DOWN to (4,4), which is an apple, then the tail wouldn't be removed, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)] (length 6). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) this turn. Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would also collect the apple. \n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), the next position is (4,5). Are there any snakes there? The enemy snake is at (3,2), so their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,5) is safe. Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) could lead towards the apples on the right, but they are further. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,4) is on the right edge. If I move RIGHT multiple times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. From (5,5), moving LEFT five times would reach (0,5), but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). Also two moves. \n\nWhich is better? Let's check the board state. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe board shows that at (5,5) is the head '2', and the apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (2,2), (0,5). \n\nSo (4,4) is an apple. So moving towards that is good. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move to (4,4) is DOWN. That's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) now, then LEFT to (4,4). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first allows for more flexibility. Because from (4,5), you can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (3,2), so they are on the lower left. Moving towards (4,4) might bring me closer to their area, but they are at (3,2), which is two steps left and two steps down from (4,4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards the right side apples. But those are further. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT. But (4,4) is an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5) and then DOWN to (4,4). \n\nBoth options are valid. Let's check for any immediate dangers. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT to (4,2). If they move LEFT to (2,2), they can eat the apple there. But that's not directly in my path. \n\nSo either path to (4,4) seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to start heading towards the right side apples. But those are at (9,4) and (9,2). From (6,5), moving RIGHT three times to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4). But that's four moves. Not as efficient. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left edge. Moving LEFT five times from (5,5) would get there, but that's a long path with possible risks. \n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple at (4,4). \n\nNow, choosing between moving LEFT or DOWN this turn. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), then next turn go LEFT to (4,4). \n\nWhich is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger in either direction. \n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake's body is at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So (4,3) is part of their body. So (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). If the enemy snake moves UP to (4,4), they could reach there. But their head is at (3,2), so they can't reach (4,4) in one move. Their possible moves from (3,2) are UP to (3,3), which is part of their body. Wait, their body is [(3,3), (4,3)]. So their head is at (3,2), body at [(3,3), (4,3)]. So if they move UP to (3,3), that's their own body. So they can't do that. So their possible moves are DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2) (apple), or RIGHT to (4,2). \n\nSo they might move LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple there. So (4,4) is safe from them. \n\nTherefore, both paths to (4,4) are safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other options. But that's not as efficient. \n\nSo the best move is either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN to (5,4), the next move to (4,4) is LEFT, which is an apple. That would give a point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4) for the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board, which might have fewer obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would start moving towards the left side, which has another apple at (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to head towards the right side apples. \n\nBut considering efficiency, the apple at (4,4) is the closest. \n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that allows more flexibility. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), then next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT again towards (3,5), etc. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), etc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (6,5) to avoid potential congestion near the left side. \n\nBut I need to prioritize getting apples. \n\nSo the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are equally good, perhaps choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side apples. \n\nWait, but moving LEFT to (4,5) doesn't immediately get me closer to (0,5), but it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) and then LEFT to (4,4) gets the apple in two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then DOWN. \n\nEither way, same number of moves. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is heading towards (4,4), but they are at (3,2), so they can't reach it quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest and most efficient move is to go LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards the apple at (4,4). \n\nWait, no.

For example, after moving to (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) allows for DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5), etc. \n\nSince the apple is at (4,4), moving DOWN first might be more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now and then DOWN is better. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT to (6,5) to explore other apples. \n\nBut the apples on the right are at (9,4) and (9,2). That's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (0,5) is on the left. \n\nBut given the current position, the closest apple is (4,4). \n\nSo the best move is to head towards (4,4). \n\nTherefore, either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nSince both are safe, I'll choose LEFT to start moving towards the left side, which has two apples (4,4 and 2,2, 0,5). \n\nWait, but (2,2) is also an apple.

Wait, no, the problem states that after the last move (LEFT), the snake's position is (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. So the head is at (4,5), and the body follows. The apples available are (9,4), (9,2), (4,4), (0,5), (7,3). \n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (4,5). The directions are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: (4,6). Check if this is safe. The board shows no snakes or walls here. The body segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. (4,6) isn't part of the body. So safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,4). That's an apple! If I move here, I'll grow. Need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,2) with body parts at (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3), which is part of the enemy's body. But moving to (4,4) itself is safe as there's no snake there. So moving DOWN to eat the apple is possible.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5). Check the board. No snakes or obstacles here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5). But (5,5) is part of my own body (the first segment after the head). Collision with self. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, considering strategy. The apple at (4,4) is directly below me. Moving DOWN would let me eat it, grow, and gain a point. That's the most immediate gain. However, after eating, my body will extend, so I need to ensure future moves are safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. The body would be [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. From (4,4), possible moves would be LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) is now part of the body). So UP would be invalid. So next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) might lead towards other apples. The apple at (0,5) is to the far left, but that's several moves away. The apple at (7,3) is to the right and down. \n\nBut the immediate gain is the apple at (4,4). Eating it now is beneficial. So moving DOWN seems optimal. \n\nCheck for any risks: enemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves are UP (3,3) which is their own body, DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2) (apple there), or RIGHT (4,2). They might go for the apple at (2,2), so they're not a direct threat to (4,4). \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best choice. It's safe and gains a point. \n\nNext, after eating, plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

The available apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (7,3), (8,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with body [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from the current head position (4,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (4,5). But (4,5) is part of my own body (the first segment). Collision with self. So UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (4,3). Check the board. The apple at (7,3) is elsewhere. The enemy snake's body includes (3,3), but (4,3) is empty. So this seems safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,4). Check for obstacles. The board shows no snakes here. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,4). Also empty. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNext, consider the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is three steps right and one down from (4,4). The apple at (0,5) is far left. The others are at the edges. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,4), I can start heading towards (7,3). Moving DOWN to (4,3) might get me closer to (7,3) as well. LEFT to (3,4) doesn't directly lead to an apple but could be a safer path.\n\nAlso, need to check enemy snake's position. Their head is at (2,1). Their possible moves could be UP to (2,2) (which is part of their body), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). They might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5), but they're far from my current position. So immediate threat is low.\n\nPrioritize getting apples. Moving RIGHT towards (7,3) seems strategic. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could set up a path towards (7,3) by then moving right. Let's see:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), next move could be RIGHT again to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT three times to (7,3). Either way, similar steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now might be better to avoid potential obstacles. Also, moving RIGHT to (5,4) keeps me away from the enemy's area. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might lead towards the apple at (0,5), but that's a longer path and might risk getting trapped. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The current body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. Moving to (5,4) adds a new head, and the tail will move. Since there's no apple eaten, the tail (6,7) will be removed. So the new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. \n\nWait, no. The snake's body after moving without eating an apple: the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the head moves to (5,4), the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. The tail (6,7) is left, so the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous. So the original body is [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]. When the head moves to (5,4), the new body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. The tail (6,7) is cut off because there's no growth. So the new body is length 5. \n\nThis movement doesn't hit any part of the body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) would have the body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]. Also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, which might offer more flexibility. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to the apple at (7,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (7,3). From (4,3), moving RIGHT three times: (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). That path is clear. \n\nBut moving DOWN now to (4,3) would require moving right three times. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (5,4) and then down to (5,3), then right twice. Either way, similar steps. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,3) is present. If I can reach it before others, that's good. Also, the apple at (8,0) is far, but maybe not worth it. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,4) might not be as beneficial. \n\nI think moving RIGHT towards (7,3) is a good path. So the next move should be RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the current head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) then RIGHT three times. Both paths are viable. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better to avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (2,1), so they might move towards the apple at (9,2) or (0,5). Not a direct threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,3) could be safer as it's away from the enemy's area. \n\nHmm. Both options seem okay. Let's prioritize the apple. Moving RIGHT now starts the journey towards (7,3). So I'll choose RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

So UP is possible.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (6,2). Check if that's safe. The board shows at (6,2) there's no snake or obstacle. So that's safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (5,3). But (5,3) is part of my body. So that's a collision. Can't go LEFT.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (7,3). There's an apple at (7,3). If I move here, I'll eat the apple and grow. That's good. But need to check if the path is safe. (7,3) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. The enemy snake is at (4,0), so they're far away. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apple is at (7,3), which is directly to the RIGHT. Eating that would give a point. So moving RIGHT is the most direct way to get an apple. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,3), the next move would need to avoid the new body segment. After eating, the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still at (5,5). So moving RIGHT again would be possible if there's a path. But first, let's focus on this move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,4) might lead towards the apple at (9,4) but that's further away. Moving DOWN to (6,2) could lead towards the apple at (9,2) but also far. The apple at (8,0) is even further down. The apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body.\n\nSo the best immediate gain is moving RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's a point and growth. \n\nCheck for any possible collisions with enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,0) with body [(3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]. They are on the lower left. Their head is at (4,0), so they might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are far from my current position. So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. That's safe and gains a point.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at (7,3) with the body segments [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The apples are at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (5,0) with body [(4,0), (3,0), (2,0)]. The board shows that my head is at (7,3), and the last move was RIGHT, which probably moved me from (6,3) to (7,3), eating the apple there. Now, after eating, my body has grown, so the next move needs to account for that.\n\nPossible moves from (7,3) are UP (to 7,4), DOWN (to 7,2), LEFT (to 6,3), or RIGHT (to 8,3). Let's check each direction:\n\n1. **UP (7,4)**: Check if this cell is safe. The board state shows that at (7,4), there's nothing mentioned. The enemy snake is far away. My own body segments are [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. (7,4) isn't part of my body. So moving UP is safe unless there's a wall. Since y=4 is within 0-9, it's valid. So UP is possible.\n\n2. **DOWN (7,2)**: Check safety. The board shows (7,2) is empty. No snakes there. Valid move.\n\n3. **LEFT (6,3)**: This is the previous position of the head, which is now part of the body. So moving LEFT would collide with (6,3), which is part of my body. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Check if (8,3) is safe. The board shows an apple at (8,0), but (8,3) isn't listed as having an apple or a snake. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, considering the apples. The closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right edge, (7,9) at the top right, (0,5) on the left, and (8,0) at the bottom right. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), that's moving towards the right edge where apples (9,4) and (9,2) are. Alternatively, moving UP towards (7,4) could lead towards (7,9) but that's a long path. Moving DOWN to (7,2) could head towards (9,2). \n\nBut let's check if there's an apple in the immediate path. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are two steps away from (8,3) and (7,2) respectively. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't get an apple immediately. Moving UP to (7,4) also doesn't. The next apple in that direction would require more steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving towards the apple at (7,9) which is at the top right. From (7,3), moving UP several times would get there, but that's a long path. \n\nAnother consideration is avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy is at (5,0), which is far from my current position. They might be moving towards the apple at (8,0) or (0,5). But they are not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the immediate options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe. \n\nWhich direction is safest and leads towards an apple? Let's think:\n\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving towards the right edge. From there, next moves could be UP to (8,4) towards (9,4) or DOWN to (8,2) towards (9,2). Both are possible. \n\n- **UP (7,4)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,4) or continue UP. \n\n- **DOWN (7,2)**: Then next moves could be RIGHT towards (8,2) or further DOWN. \n\nSince the apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are on the right edge, moving RIGHT now positions me closer to both. However, moving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't immediately get an apple. But it's a step in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) might allow me to then move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4). That's two moves to get the apple. Similarly, moving DOWN to (7,2) and then RIGHT to (8,2), then to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for possible collisions. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), the next move would be to (9,3) if I go RIGHT again, but (9,3) is not an apple. To reach (9,4), I need to go UP from (8,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) and then RIGHT to (8,4), then UP to (9,4). That path seems possible. \n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't box myself in. Let's also check the current body. After moving RIGHT to (8,3), the new body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail is at (5,5), so there's space behind. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (7,2) to approach the apple at (9,2). From (7,2), moving RIGHT twice to (9,2). \n\nBut which path is less risky? Let's think about possible obstacles. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are on the lower left. They might be moving towards (8,0) or (0,5). But their path doesn't intersect mine immediately. \n\nSo, the safest immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple. The apples at (9,4) and (9,2) are both two moves away. Moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows flexibility to go UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN now could set a direction towards those apples. \n\nBut since there's no immediate apple in the current direction, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is a neutral move that keeps options open. \n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP from (7,3) to (7,4), then continue UP towards (7,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now to start heading towards (7,9). But that's six moves up. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to get that apple. That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Also three moves. \n\nHmm. Both paths take the same number of steps. \n\nBut moving RIGHT first might be better because it positions me closer to both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now could start the ascent towards (7,9). \n\nBut (7,9) is quite far. Maybe prioritize the closer apples first. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (8,0) is at the bottom right. If I move DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2), then further DOWN to (7,1), etc., but that's moving away from most apples. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but moving LEFT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the best options are to move towards the right edge apples. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a good step towards (9,4) or (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut which is safer? Let's check the board again. \n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nRow 4 (y=4) has T (my body) at (4,4) and (5,4). The apple at (9,4) is in row 4. \n\nRow 2 (y=2) has an apple at (9,2). \n\nSo moving RIGHT to (8,3) is in row 3. Then, from (8,3), moving UP to (8,4) (row 4) would be safe if there's no obstacle. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) (row 4), which is safe. \n\nBut in both cases, the next move would need to check for body parts. \n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT back to (7,3) because that's the body. So after moving RIGHT, the next options would be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. \n\nSimilarly, moving UP to (7,4) would allow next moves UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. \n\nBut since the goal is to reach the apples, moving RIGHT seems better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP first to start the path upwards. \n\nBut without immediate apple in that direction, perhaps moving RIGHT is better. \n\nAnother point: the apple at (7,9) is at the top right. If I can reach that, it's a high-value target, but it's far. However, moving UP now might not be the most efficient. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) to get that apple. \n\nBut (9,3) is not an apple, so that's an extra step. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). Same number of steps. \n\nSo both paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first gives more flexibility. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might avoid potential collisions. \n\nWait, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), the body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The next move to (8,3) would leave the tail at (5,5), so the body is growing. \n\nBut since I just ate an apple in the last move, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. Wait, when you eat an apple, the snake grows by one segment. So after moving to (7,3) (the apple), the body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] plus the new head. Wait, no: the head moves to (7,3), and the body follows. So the body after eating the apple would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When you move, the head moves forward, and the tail follows unless you ate an apple. \n\nWait, the rules state that if you move onto an apple, you grow. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. \n\nSo after eating the apple at (7,3), the snake's body would be [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nOriginal body before moving: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The head was at (6,3). Then moved RIGHT to (7,3), eating the apple. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. Because when you eat an apple, you add a new head and the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The snake moves: head moves to new position, each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't shorten, so the body grows by one. \n\nSo original length was 6 segments (head + 5 body parts). After eating an apple, the length becomes 7. So the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. If the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body increases by one segment. \n\nSo before the move, the body was [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] (head at (6,3), then the next segments). After moving RIGHT to (7,3) and eating the apple, the new body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]? Wait, that would be adding a new head and keeping the tail. So the tail is now (5,5), but the body segments are the previous ones plus the new head. \n\nWait, perhaps the body after eating is [new head] + previous body without cutting the tail. So the length increases by one. \n\nSo in this case, after moving to (7,3), the body becomes [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is still (5,5), but the body is longer. \n\nTherefore, in the current state, the snake's body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. \n\nSo when considering possible moves, the body includes (7,3) as the head, followed by (6,3), (5,3), etc. \n\nSo moving LEFT to (6,3) would collide with the next body segment. Hence, LEFT is unsafe. \n\nNow, back to the current possible moves. \n\nIf I move UP to (7,4), that's safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, two moves after the first to reach the apple. \n\nBut moving UP now might be better to start the ascent. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (8,3) keeps options open for both UP and DOWN next. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,2) is two moves down from (8,3). So moving RIGHT to (8,3), then DOWN to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nBut that's also possible. \n\nSo moving RIGHT gives flexibility to go either UP or DOWN next. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) allows moving RIGHT towards (9,4). \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (5,0), so they are far away. The main danger is my own body. \n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8,3), the next move can't be LEFT, but can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,3), then RIGHT again to (9,3), which is safe. Then UP to (9,4) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nEither way, it's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then RIGHT to (9,4). \n\nBoth paths are similar. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it positions me closer to both apples (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (7,4) might be safer if there's a potential collision in the right direction. \n\nBut there's no indication of that. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,9) is at the top. If I move UP several times, but that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (8,3), I could move UP to (8,4), then continue UP towards (8,5), etc., but that's a longer path. \n\nGiven the options, moving RIGHT to (8,3) seems like a solid choice to position towards both (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,2) to head towards (9,2). \n\nBut moving DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2) is safe. Then next move RIGHT to (8,2), then RIGHT to (9,2). \n\nThat's two moves after DOWN to reach the apple. \n\nSo comparing the two options: moving RIGHT to (8,3) allows access to both (9,4) and (9,2) in two moves, while moving DOWN to (7,2) focuses on (9,2). \n\nWhich apple is closer? Both are two moves away from their respective paths. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (9,4) is more accessible from (8,3) than (9,2) from (7,2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path to (9,2) is shorter. \n\nBut without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother factor: the apple at (9,4) is in row 4, which is where part of my body is. But that's the tail end. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is in row 2, which is clear. \n\nBut both are viable. \n\nGiven that, perhaps moving RIGHT to (8,3) is the best choice to keep options open. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,4) to start moving towards (9,4). \n\nBut I need to decide based on current safety and potential growth. \n\nSince all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe, the best move is to head towards the nearest apple. \n\nBut which apple is nearest? \n\nThe apple at (9,4) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then UP. \n\nThe apple at (9,2) is two moves away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. \n\nThe apple at (7,9) is six moves up. \n\nThe apple at (8,0) is far down and right. \n\nThe apple at (0,5) is on the left, but blocked. \n\nSo the closest apples are (9,4) and (9,2). \n\nSince moving RIGHT allows me to choose between them next, that's the best option. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (8,3).\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

The body is [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The apples are still at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9).

Let's check each:\n\n1. **UP (8,4)**: Is this safe? The board shows no snakes there. My body segments are [(7,3), (6,3), etc.]. (8,4) isn't part of my body. Valid move.\n\n2. **DOWN (8,2)**: Also safe. No obstacles mentioned. \n\n3. **LEFT (7,3)**: That's part of my body (the first segment after the head). Moving LEFT would collide. Unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9,3)**: Within the board. No apple there, but safe unless another snake is present. The enemy snake is far away. Valid.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest are (9,4) and (9,2). Moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4) gets closer to (9,4). Next move could be RIGHT to (9,4). Moving DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2). Moving RIGHT to (9,3) doesn't get an apple but positions for future moves.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's think:\n\n- **UP to (8,4)**: One step closer to (9,4). Next move RIGHT to (9,4) would eat the apple. That's efficient.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,2)**: Next move RIGHT to (9,2) for the apple. Also efficient.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,3)**: Then UP to (9,4) or DOWN to (9,2). Adds an extra step but keeps options open.\n\nSince both apples are equally reachable in two moves, but moving UP or DOWN now directly targets one. Which apple is safer? The enemy snake is at (6,0), so they might be heading towards (8,0) or (0,5). Not a threat here.\n\nIf I go UP to (8,4), next move RIGHT to (9,4) gets the apple. That's good. Similarly, DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2). Both are viable. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3) allows me to choose between UP or DOWN next. But that adds a step. \n\nSince the goal is to collect apples quickly, moving UP or DOWN now is better. \n\nWhich apple to prioritize? (9,4) is in the same column as my current position if I move UP. (9,2) is two steps down and right. \n\nBut both are equally distant. Maybe choose the one with fewer obstacles. Looking at the board, (9,4) is in row 4, which has some of my body segments (like (4,4), (5,4)), but those are far away. The path to (9,4) from (8,4) is clear. \n\nSimilarly, (9,2) is in row 2, which seems clear. \n\nSince both are safe, perhaps choose the one that's more in line with current direction. Since I moved RIGHT last time, continuing towards the right edge makes sense. \n\nBut to get the apple, moving UP now to (8,4) then RIGHT is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3) might risk getting stuck if there's no apple. \n\nSo the best move is UP to (8,4) to head towards (9,4). \n\nWait, but after moving UP to (8,4), the next move would be RIGHT to (9,4), which is the apple. That's two moves total. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4) is also two moves. \n\nBut moving UP now is more direct. \n\nYes, moving UP to (8,4) is better. \n\nSo the next move should be UP.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The apples are located at (9,4), (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), and (7,9). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7,0) with a body that doesn't seem to be in my immediate path.\n\nFirst, I need to check possible moves from (8,4). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (8,5)**: This is within the 10x10 grid. Checking the board state, there's no immediate obstacle mentioned here. However, looking at the provided board diagram, row 5 has an apple at (0,5) but that's far. The path up from (8,4) to (8,5) seems clear. No body parts or enemy snakes are there. Safe move.\n\n2. **DOWN (8,3)**: This is the previous position of the snake's head. Since the body segments include (8,3), moving down would collide with my own body. That's a death move. Avoid.\n\n3. **LEFT (7,4)**: Checking the board, (7,4) isn't listed as part of my body or the enemy's. The enemy snake is at (7,0), so this position should be safe. Moving left here could be a way to navigate towards the apple at (7,9) but that's quite a distance. However, immediate safety is okay.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9,4)**: This is the position of one of the apples. Moving right here would collect the apple at (9,4), grow the snake, and gain a point. The position (9,4) is within the grid, and there's no mention of another snake or obstacle there. This seems like the optimal move to score immediately.\n\nConsidering the goal is to collect apples and avoid collisions, moving RIGHT to (9,4) is the best choice. It directly gains a point and grows the snake. The other moves either risk collision (DOWN) or don't immediately collect an apple (UP, LEFT). \n\nAdditionally, after collecting (9,4), the next closest apple would be (9,2) or (7,9). Planning ahead, moving towards (9,2) after collecting (9,4) might be strategic, but for the current move, RIGHT is the clear choice.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (9,4) because the last move was RIGHT. The body parts are [(8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]. So the head moved from (8,4) to (9,4) in the last move. Now, the next move needs to decide where to go from (9,4).\n\nLooking at the apples available: (9,2), (0,5), (8,0), (7,9), (1,9). The apple at (9,2) is two steps down from the current position. The apple at (7,9) is up and to the left. The others are further away.\n\nPossible directions from (9,4) are UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1). But since the board is 10x10, x=9 is the rightmost column. So moving RIGHT to x=10 is invalid (out of bounds). So RIGHT is not possible. So available moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n1. **UP (9,5)**: Is there any obstacle? The board state shows at row 5 (y=5) there's an apple at (0,5), but that's not relevant here. The current position is (9,4). Moving up to (9,5) would be a new position. Checking the snake's body: the body segments are [(8,4), (8,3), ...]. So (9,5) isn't part of the body. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,1) with body [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0)], so no conflict here. So UP seems safe.\n\n2. **DOWN (9,3)**: Moving down to (9,3). Check if that's part of the body. The body includes (8,3), (7,3), etc., but (9,3) isn't listed. Also, no enemy snakes there. So DOWN is safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (8,4)**: Moving left to (8,4). But looking at the snake's body, the first segment after the head is (8,4). So moving left would collide with the body. That's a death. So LEFT is not an option.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or DOWN. Now, which is better strategically?\n\nIf I go UP to (9,5), that's moving away from the apple at (9,2). If I go DOWN to (9,3), then next move could go further down to (9,2) to get the apple. So moving DOWN now would set up to collect the apple at (9,2) in the next step. That seems better. Let me check the path:\n\nFrom (9,4) to (9,3) (DOWN), then next move to (9,2) (DOWN again) would collect the apple. But need to make sure that after moving DOWN to (9,3), the next move to (9,2) is possible. However, after moving DOWN to (9,3), the body would be [(9,4), (8,4), (8,3), ...]. So the next move to (9,2) would be safe unless there's an obstacle. The apple at (9,2) is present, so moving there would grow the snake. That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,5) might lead towards other apples, but the closest ones are (7,9) and (1,9). From (9,5), moving left towards (8,5), then up to (8,6), etc., but that's a longer path. The apple at (7,9) is at the top right, so moving up and left could be a way, but it's further away.\n\nSo the best immediate move is DOWN to (9,3), setting up to collect the apple at (9,2) next. That's a quick point gain. Also, need to check if moving DOWN now would cause any immediate collision. The current body after moving to (9,4) is [(8,4), (8,3), ...]. So (9,3) is not part of the body. So yes, safe.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

So LEFT is invalid.\n\nRIGHT is out of bounds, so invalid.\n\nWait, but the possible directions from (9,3) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But RIGHT is invalid. So only DOWN is valid? Because UP and LEFT lead to body collisions.\n\nWait, the snake's body is [(9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. So the head is at (9,3). Moving UP to (9,4) would hit the first body segment. Moving LEFT to (8,3) would hit the third body segment. So only DOWN is possible. But wait, what about moving DOWN to (9,2)? That's an apple. Let me check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nThe row for y=2 (since coordinates start at (0,0) at the bottom) is row 2. The board shows at (9,2) there's an apple (A). So moving DOWN to (9,2) is safe and collects the apple. No enemy snakes are there. So the only valid move is DOWN.
