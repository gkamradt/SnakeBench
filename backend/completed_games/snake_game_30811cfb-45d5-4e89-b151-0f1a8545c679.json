The apples on the board are located at (9,2), (9,4), (5,1), (6,0) and (2,7). Notice that (2,7) is the nearest apple: from our head (5,8) it\u2019s 3 steps left and 1 step down (Manhattan distance 4). Unfortunately, going LEFT immediately isn\u2019t safe because (4,8) is occupied by our own body. The other candidate directions from our current head (5,8) are:\n\n\u2022 UP: Leads to (5,9); however, according to the board, position (5,9) is occupied (a body segment is shown there).\n\n\u2022 RIGHT: Leads to (6,8), a safe square but takes us further from apple (2,7) (its Manhattan distance would be 5).\n\n\u2022 DOWN: Leads to (5,7). This square is free, and after the move, our tail segment at (4,8) would be removed (since we\u2019re not growing), in due course opening up more space. From the new head at (5,7) the target apple at (2,7) would be just 3 steps to the left.\n\nThus, after this careful look, moving DOWN is the safest path that gets us closer to the nearest apple.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."

The apples on the board are located at (9,2), (9,4), (5,1), (6,0) and (2,7). Notice that (2,7) is the nearest apple: from our head (5,8) it\u2019s 3 steps left and 1 step down (Manhattan distance 4). Unfortunately, going LEFT immediately isn\u2019t safe because (4,8) is occupied by our own body. The other candidate directions from our current head (5,8) are:\n\n\u2022 UP: Leads to (5,9); however, according to the board, position (5,9) is occupied (a body segment is shown there).\n\n\u2022 RIGHT: Leads to (6,8), a safe square but takes us further from apple (2,7) (its Manhattan distance would be 5).\n\n\u2022 DOWN: Leads to (5,7). This square is free, and after the move, our tail segment at (4,8) would be removed (since we\u2019re not growing), in due course opening up more space. From the new head at (5,7) the target apple at (2,7) would be just 3 steps to the left.\n\nThus, after this careful look, moving DOWN is the safest path that gets us closer to the nearest apple.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."

That leaves two possible safe moves from (3,0):\n\n\u2022 UP to (3,1): This move is safe (the board shows a dot there) and from (3,1) we\u2019d have a clear route to go left toward column 2. That would set us up to reach apple (2,2) in just a couple moves.\n\n\u2022 RIGHT to (4,0): Although safe, it takes us farther from the (2,2) apple. Plus, moving right risks getting closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory (the enemy snake\u2019s head is at (7,0) along with part of its body near that region).\n\nThus, the optimal path toward the closest apple is to head UP from (3,0) to (3,1) and then plan to shift left in the following moves.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

I'm still close to the apple at (5, 5), and I can see that the enemy snake is still not a threat to me at the moment.
