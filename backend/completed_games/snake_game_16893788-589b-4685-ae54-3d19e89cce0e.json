Since I'm closer to the apples at (7, 1), (8, 1), and (8, 2), I'll focus on those for now.\n\nI think I'll head down towards the apples. If I go down, I'll be at (7, 3), which is still a safe distance from Snake #2. From there, I can decide whether to go left or right to grab an apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully eat an apple, I'll try to position myself to grab another one while keeping an eye on Snake #2's movement.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

Since I'm currently at (9, 5), I can move up (DOWN would take me outside the board), left (LEFT would take me into the path of snake #1), or right (RIGHT would be a good option to collect the apple at (7, 1)).\n\nNow, let's consider the strategy. Moving right would allow me to collect an apple and potentially grow, which is always a good thing. However, it would also bring me closer to snake #1. On the other hand, moving left would keep me further away from snake #1 but would not allow me to collect an apple this turn.\n\nGiven the current situation, I choose to prioritize collecting apples and growing, so I will move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
