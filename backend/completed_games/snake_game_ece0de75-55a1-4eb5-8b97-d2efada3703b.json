Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (1,3). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (8,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,8), (6,2), (8,8), (1,5), and (0,8).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out. The one at (1,8) is near the top left, (6,2) is somewhere in the middle, (8,8) is top right, (1,5) is a bit below the top left, and (0,8) is top left corner. My snake is at (1,3), which is in the lower left part of the board.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The closest apple is at (1,5), which is directly above me. That's only two moves up. The other apples are further away. But I should also consider the enemy snake's position. It's at (8,3), which is on the same row as me but on the opposite side. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should be cautious.\n\nIf I move up to (1,4), I can check if that's safe. Wait, but moving up from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that a valid move? Let me check the rules. I can't move into a wall, another snake, or my own body. My body isn't shown here, but since I'm just starting, I don't have a long body yet. The enemy snake is at (8,3), so that's not in my path.\n\nSo moving up seems safe. If I go to (1,4), then next move I can go to (1,5) and eat that apple, gaining a point. That seems like a good plan. Alternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,8), but that's quite a distance. It would require moving left and then up, but I'm already at (1,3). Maybe that's too far, and the other apple is closer.\n\nAnother option is to go for (6,2), but that's also a bit of a journey. I think focusing on the closest apple is better for now. So, moving up to (1,4) is the first step. Then, I can proceed to (1,5) and eat the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving up is the best direction. Let me visualize the board. From (1,3), moving up would take me to (1,4), which is empty. Then (1,5) is also empty. So yes, that's a safe path. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake since it's far away.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move up towards the apple at (1,5). That way, I can eat it quickly and gain a point without risking collision with the enemy or walls.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move UP towards the closest apple at (1,5).

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (1,3). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (8,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,8), (6,2), (8,8), (1,5), and (0,8).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out. The one at (1,8) is near the top left, (6,2) is somewhere in the middle, (8,8) is top right, (1,5) is a bit below the top left, and (0,8) is top left corner. My snake is at (1,3), which is in the lower left part of the board.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The closest apple is at (1,5), which is directly above me. That's only two moves up. The other apples are further away. But I should also consider the enemy snake's position. It's at (8,3), which is on the same row as me but on the opposite side. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should be cautious.\n\nIf I move up to (1,4), I can check if that's safe. Wait, but moving up from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that a valid move? Let me check the rules. I can't move into a wall, another snake, or my own body. My body isn't shown here, but since I'm just starting, I don't have a long body yet. The enemy snake is at (8,3), so that's not in my path.\n\nSo moving up seems safe. If I go to (1,4), then next move I can go to (1,5) and eat that apple, gaining a point. That seems like a good plan. Alternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,8), but that's quite a distance. It would require moving left and then up, but I'm already at (1,3). Maybe that's too far, and the other apple is closer.\n\nAnother option is to go for (6,2), but that's also a bit of a journey. I think focusing on the closest apple is better for now. So, moving up to (1,4) is the first step. Then, I can proceed to (1,5) and eat the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving up is the best direction. Let me visualize the board. From (1,3), moving up would take me to (1,4), which is empty. Then (1,5) is also empty. So yes, that's a safe path. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake since it's far away.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move up towards the apple at (1,5). That way, I can eat it quickly and gain a point without risking collision with the enemy or walls.\n\n**UP**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (1,3). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (8,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,8), (6,2), (8,8), (1,5), and (0,8).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out. The one at (1,8) is near the top left, (6,2) is somewhere in the middle, (8,8) is top right, (1,5) is a bit below the top left, and (0,8) is top left corner. My snake is at (1,3), which is in the lower left part of the board.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The closest apple is at (1,5), which is directly above me. That's only two moves up. The other apples are further away. But I should also consider the enemy snake's position. It's at (8,3), which is on the same row as me but on the opposite side. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should be cautious.\n\nIf I move up to (1,4), I can check if that's safe. Wait, but moving up from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that a valid move? Let me check the rules. I can't move into a wall, another snake, or my own body. My body isn't shown here, but since I'm just starting, I don't have a long body yet. The enemy snake is at (8,3), so that's not in my path.\n\nSo moving up seems safe. If I go to (1,4), then next move I can go to (1,5) and eat that apple, gaining a point. That seems like a good plan. Alternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,8), but that's quite a distance. It would require moving left and then up, but I'm already at (1,3). Maybe that's too far, and the other apple is closer.\n\nAnother option is to go for (6,2), but that's also a bit of a journey. I think focusing on the closest apple is better for now. So, moving up to (1,4) is the first step. Then, I can proceed to (1,5) and eat the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving up is the best direction. Let me visualize the board. From (1,3), moving up would take me to (1,4), which is empty. Then (1,5) is also empty. So yes, that's a safe path. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake since it's far away.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move up towards the apple at (1,5). That way, I can eat it quickly and gain a point without risking collision with the enemy or walls.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move UP towards the closest apple at (1,5). This path is safe and allows me to eat the apple quickly.\n\n**UP**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (1,3). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (8,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,8), (6,2), (8,8), (1,5), and (0,8).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out. The one at (1,8) is near the top left, (6,2) is somewhere in the middle, (8,8) is top right, (1,5) is a bit below the top left, and (0,8) is top left corner. My snake is at (1,3), which is in the lower left part of the board.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The closest apple is at (1,5), which is directly above me. That's only two moves up. The other apples are further away. But I should also consider the enemy snake's position. It's at (8,3), which is on the same row as me but on the opposite side. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should be cautious.\n\nIf I move up to (1,4), I can check if that's safe. Wait, but moving up from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that a valid move? Let me check the rules. I can't move into a wall, another snake, or my own body. My body isn't shown here, but since I'm just starting, I don't have a long body yet. The enemy snake is at (8,3), so that's not in my path.\n\nSo moving up seems safe. If I go to (1,4), then next move I can go to (1,5) and eat that apple, gaining a point. That seems like a good plan. Alternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,8), but that's quite a distance. It would require moving left and then up, but I'm already at (1,3). Maybe that's too far, and the other apple is closer.\n\nAnother option is to go for (6,2), but that's also a bit of a journey. I think focusing on the closest apple is better for now. So, moving up to (1,4) is the first step. Then, I can proceed to (1,5) and eat the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving up is the best direction. Let me visualize the board. From (1,3), moving up would take me to (1,4), which is empty. Then (1,5) is also empty. So yes, that's a safe path. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake since it's far away.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move up towards the apple at (1,5). That way, I can eat it quickly and gain a point without risking collision with the enemy or walls.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move UP towards the closest apple at (1,5).

The enemy snake is at (8,3) with no body, so it's not blocking me right now.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (1,5), which is directly above me. That's only two moves up. If I move up, I can reach it quickly. The other apples are further away, so focusing on the closest one makes sense.\n\nI should check if moving up is safe. From (1,3), moving up takes me to (1,4), which is empty. Then to (1,5), also empty. No walls, snakes, or my own body in the way.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, I'm snake #1, and I'm currently at position (1,8). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The apples are located at (6,2), (8,8), (0,8), (4,2), and (4,7). There's also an enemy snake at (7,5) with no body, so it's not blocking anything right now.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the closest apple to me is at (0,8). That's directly to the left of my current position. If I move left, I can reach it quickly. Moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8), which is an apple. That seems like a good move because it's the closest and I can gain a point without much hassle.\n\nI should also check if moving left is safe. Since the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is quite far from me, there's no immediate threat. Also, moving left doesn't take me into any walls or my own body, as I don't have a long body to collide with.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. For example, (4,2) and (6,2) are lower on the board, but they're further away. Similarly, (8,8) is to the right and up, but that's a longer distance. (4,7) is also somewhere in the middle. Since I'm at (1,8), moving left to (0,8) is the most straightforward and quickest way to get an apple.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After eating the apple at (0,8), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head in a different direction. But for now, focusing on the closest apple makes sense.\n\nSo, moving left to (0,8) seems like the best move. It's safe, gets me a point, and doesn't put me in any danger. I don't see any reason to wait or move elsewhere.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (1,3). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (8,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,8), (6,2), (8,8), (1,5), and (0,8).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out. The one at (1,8) is near the top left, (6,2) is somewhere in the middle, (8,8) is top right, (1,5) is a bit below the top left, and (0,8) is top left corner. My snake is at (1,3), which is in the lower left part of the board.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The closest apple is at (1,5), which is directly above me. That's only two moves up. The other apples are further away. But I should also consider the enemy snake's position. It's at (8,3), which is on the same row as me but on the opposite side. Since its body is empty, it's not a threat right now, but I should be cautious.\n\nIf I move up to (1,4), I can check if that's safe. Wait, but moving up from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that a valid move? Let me check the rules. I can't move into a wall, another snake, or my own body. My body isn't shown here, but since I'm just starting, I don't have a long body yet. The enemy snake is at (8,3), so that's not in my path.\n\nSo moving up seems safe. If I go to (1,4), then next move I can go to (1,5) and eat that apple, gaining a point. That seems like a good plan. Alternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,8), but that's quite a distance. It would require moving left and then up, but I'm already at (1,3). Maybe that's too far, and the other apple is closer.\n\nAnother option is to go for (6,2), but that's also a bit of a journey. I think focusing on the closest apple is better for now. So, moving up to (1,4) is the first step. Then, I can proceed to (1,5) and eat the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving up is the best direction. Let me visualize the board. From (1,3), moving up would take me to (1,4), which is empty. Then (1,5) is also empty. So yes, that's a safe path. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake since it's far away.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move up towards the apple at (1,5). That way, I can eat it quickly and gain a point without risking collision with the enemy or walls.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move UP towards the closest apple at (1,5). This path is safe and allows me to eat the apple quickly.\n\n**UP**"

Alternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (0,8), but that's quite a distance. It would require moving left and then up, but I'm already at (1,3). Maybe that's too far, and the other apple is closer.\n\nAnother option is to go for (6,2), but that's also a bit of a journey. I think focusing on the closest apple is better for now. So, moving up to (1,4) is the first step. Then, I can proceed to (1,5) and eat the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving up is the best direction. Let me visualize the board. From (1,3), moving up would take me to (1,4), which is empty. Then (1,5) is also empty. So yes, that's a safe path. I don't see any immediate threats from the enemy snake since it's far away.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move up towards the apple at (1,5). That way, I can eat it quickly and gain a point without risking collision with the enemy or walls.\n\n**UP**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, I'm snake #1, and I'm currently at position (1,8). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The apples are located at (6,2), (8,8), (0,8), (4,2), and (4,7). There's also an enemy snake at (7,5) with no body, so it's not blocking anything right now.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the closest apple to me is at (0,8). That's directly to the left of my current position. If I move left, I can reach it quickly. Moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8), which is an apple. That seems like a good move because it's the closest and I can gain a point without much hassle.\n\nI should also check if moving left is safe. Since the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is quite far from me, there's no immediate threat. Also, moving left doesn't take me into any walls or my own body, as I don't have a long body to collide with.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. For example, (4,2) and (6,2) are lower on the board, but they're further away. Similarly, (8,8) is to the right and up, but that's a longer distance. (4,7) is also somewhere in the middle. Since I'm at (1,8), moving left to (0,8) is the most straightforward and quickest way to get an apple.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After eating the apple at (0,8), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head in a different direction. But for now, focusing on the closest apple makes sense.\n\nSo, moving left to (0,8) seems like the best move. It's safe, gets me a point, and doesn't put me in any danger. I don't see any reason to wait or move elsewhere.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, I'm snake #1, and I'm currently at position (1,8). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The apples are located at (6,2), (8,8), (0,8), (4,2), and (4,7). There's also an enemy snake at (7,5) with no body, so it's not blocking anything right now.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the closest apple to me is at (0,8). That's directly to the left of my current position. If I move left, I can reach it quickly. Moving left from (1,8) would take me to (0,8), which is an apple. That seems like a good move because it's the closest and I can gain a point without much hassle.\n\nI should also check if moving left is safe. Since the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is quite far from me, there's no immediate threat. Also, moving left doesn't take me into any walls or my own body, as I don't have a long body to collide with.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. For example, (4,2) and (6,2) are lower on the board, but they're further away. Similarly, (8,8) is to the right and up, but that's a longer distance. (4,7) is also somewhere in the middle. Since I'm at (1,8), moving left to (0,8) is the most straightforward and quickest way to get an apple.\n\nI should also think about future moves. After eating the apple at (0,8), I can decide whether to go for another nearby apple or head in a different direction. But for now, focusing on the closest apple makes sense.\n\nSo, moving left to (0,8) seems like the best move.
