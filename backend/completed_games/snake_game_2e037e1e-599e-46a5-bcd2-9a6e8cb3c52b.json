We should keep an eye on Snake #1's movement and be prepared to change direction if necessary.\n\nSince we're already at the same y-coordinate as the apple at (1, 9) is not in our immediate path, we can move right to get closer to that apple is not possible, but we can move right to get closer to the apple at (8, 0) or move up to get closer to the apple at (1, 9). However, we should also consider the fact that Snake #1 is at position (5, 8) and has a body part at (6, 8), which means it might be planning to move left to (5, 8) or stay at (6, 8). We should be cautious and avoid a potential collision.\n\nConsidering the positions of the other apples, we can also think about moving down to (4, 7) and then left to (3, 7) to get closer to the apple at (2, 0) or (8, 0), but this would require a few more moves and might not be the most efficient route.\n\nFor now, let's focus on getting closer to the apple at (8, 0). We'll move right and see how Snake #1 reacts.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on Snake #1's movement and be prepared to change direction if necessary. Also, consider the positions of the other apples and plan a route to the next one.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
