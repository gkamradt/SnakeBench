There are no immediate walls or enemy snakes on the direct path.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- Continue towards the apple at (5, 5).\n- Keep an eye on enemy snake #2 but concentrate on path optimization for apple acquisition.\n- Reassess the situation and apple priorities after moving towards (5, 5).\n\n**Next Move Decision:** RIGHT"

It\u2019s highly unlikely for a head-to-head collision to occur with Snake #1 as it is positioned far from our current position and there are no apples in its vicinity that it needs to get to. \n\nSo, my next move: LEFT\n\nFor subsequent turns, I need to continue aiming for the apple at (5, 5) while being mindful of the wall on the left. Once I have collected the apple at (5, 5) my next target would be the apple at (0, 8). I need to keep monitoring Snake #1 and its direction, especially when it starts moving towards the top of the board.\n\n--End of your next move information.--"
