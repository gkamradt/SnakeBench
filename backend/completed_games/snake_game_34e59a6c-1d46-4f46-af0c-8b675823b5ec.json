However, before moving, I need to ensure it's safe to do so.\n\nFirst, let's check if there's a wall in the way. Since I'm currently at (5, 7), moving up (5, 6) will take me out of the board, so that's not an option. Moving down (5, 8) would be going backwards, which is not allowed. Moving left (4, 7) would take me closer to the apple at (6, 3), which I've already eaten. Moving right (6, 7) would take me away from the apple at (8, 9), so that's not ideal.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other snakes in the way. The only other snake is Snake #1, which is at (8, 2). If I move right (6, 7), I would be moving towards Snake #1, which could potentially lead to a collision.\n\nGiven these considerations, the safest move would be to move left (4, 7). This move will take me away from the apple at (8, 9), but it's the safest option for now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving left (4, 7), I will wait for a moment to see if Snake #1 moves closer or if it's safe to move towards the apple at (8, 9). If it's safe, I will move right (5, 7) to approach the apple.\n\nEnd of response: LEFT (4, 7) - This move will take me away from the apple at (8, 9) for now, ensuring safety from collisions."

I'll try to avoid Snake #2 for now and focus on collecting apples.\n\nTo get to the apple at (8, 7), I need to move up again.
