It's a safe move and it keeps me away from the enemy snake.\n- **LEFT (3, 7)**: This doesn't take me closer to any apples.\n- **RIGHT (5, 7)**: Also a neutral move that doesn\u2019t bring me closer to an apple, but it\u2019s still a safe move. It could be useful in case I plan to go towards (8, 5) later.\n\n### Optimal Strategy:\n1. Focus on getting closer to an apple.\n2. Prioritize the nearest apples to avoid unnecessary risks.\n3. Stay clear of the board edges and enemy snake's position for now.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that moving DOWN from (4, 7) to (4, 6) takes me a step closer to the apples at (2, 5) and (8, 5), and considering it's a safe move, that's the direction I'll choose.\n\n---\n\n### Next Move:\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (6,9). There are apples at (7,1), (2,1), (8,5), (0,8), and (2,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,7), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are towards the top. My position at (6,9) is towards the top-middle of the board.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . 2 . . .\n\nRow 8: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . A . . . . . . A\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . A . . . . A . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, from this, I can see that:\n\n- At row 9, column 6, there's my head (2).\n\n- At row 8, column 0, there's an apple (A).\n\n- At row 7, column 4, there's enemy snake 1 (1).\n\n- At row 5, columns 2 and 9, there are apples.\n\n- At row 1, columns 2 and 7, there are apples.\n\n- At row 0, nothing.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which apple to go for. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize which one to eat first to maximize my score while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into walls or myself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions relative to my current location.\n\nI'm at (6,9). Let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (7,1): |7-6| + |1-9| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\n- (2,1): |2-6| + |1-9| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\n- (8,5): |8-6| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (0,8): |0-6| + |8-9| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (2,5): |2-6| + |5-9| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,5) with a distance of 6, followed by (0,8) at 7, then (2,5) at 8, (7,1) at 9, and (2,1) at 12.\n\nBut distance isn't the only factor. I need to consider the path to each apple and whether there are obstacles in the way, like the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (4,7). I need to make sure not to run into it. Also, since it's probably moving, I need to anticipate its movement.\n\nWait, but I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or its body parts. It just says its position is (4,7) with no body parts listed. Maybe it's just the head, so it's smaller than me.\n\nI need to consider that snakes can grow by eating apples, so maybe it's also trying to eat apples.\n\nBut for now, let's assume it's just the head at (4,7), and it's not moving yet, or I don't know its direction.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safest approach is to go for the apple that's farthest from the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (7,1): that's bottom-middle, quite far from the enemy.\n\n- (2,1): also bottom-middle, again far.\n\n- (8,5): middle-right.\n\n- (0,8): top-right corner.\n\n- (2,5): middle-left.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,7), so apples at (7,1) and (2,1) are quite far vertically.\n\nBut considering my position at (6,9), moving to (7,1) would require moving down significantly, and similarly for (2,1). Moving to (8,5) would involve moving right and down a bit, to (0,8) left and down, and to (2,5) left and down.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (8,5).\n\nFrom (6,9) to (8,5):\n\n- Move right to (7,9)\n\n- Move right to (8,9)\n\n- Move down to (8,8)\n\n- Move down to (8,7)\n\n- Move down to (8,6)\n\n- Move down to (8,5)\n\nThat's a distance of 6 moves.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Looking at the board, between (6,9) and (8,5), there doesn't seem to be any immediate obstacles. The enemy is at (4,7), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nWait, but if I move down and right, I might cross paths with the enemy if it's moving up or right.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (0,8), which is left and down.\n\nFrom (6,9) to (0,8):\n\n- Move left to (5,9)\n\n- Move left to (4,9)\n\n- Move left to (3,9)\n\n- Move left to (2,9)\n\n- Move left to (1,9)\n\n- Move left to (0,9)\n\n- Move down to (0,8)\n\nThat's 6 moves to the left and one down, total of 7 moves.\n\nAgain, I need to consider if the enemy might be in my way. The enemy is at (4,7), which is below and to the left of me.\n\nIf I move left, I might run into the enemy if it's moving up.\n\nAlternatively, going for the apple at (2,5):\n\nFrom (6,9) to (2,5):\n\n- Move left to (5,9)\n\n- Move left to (4,9)\n\n- Move left to (3,9)\n\n- Move left to (2,9)\n\n- Move down to (2,8)\n\n- Move down to (2,7)\n\n- Move down to (2,6)\n\n- Move down to (2,5)\n\nThat's 4 left and 4 down, total of 8 moves.\n\nAgain, potential for running into the enemy at (4,7).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which apple is closest and least likely to have the enemy intercept me.\n\nThe apple at (8,5) seems promising because it's to the right, and the enemy is to the left and below me.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible movements.\n\nIf the enemy is at (4,7), and assuming it's trying to reach one of the apples, perhaps it would go for the apple at (2,5), which is closer to it.\n\nFrom (4,7) to (2,5):\n\n- Move left to (3,7)\n\n- Move left to (2,7)\n\n- Move down to (2,6)\n\n- Move down to (2,5)\n\nThat's 2 left and 2 down, total of 4 moves.\n\nAlternatively, it could go for the apple at (7,1), which is farther, or (2,1), which is also fairly far.\n\nBut given its current position, (2,5) seems the closest.\n\nSo, if I go for (8,5), and the enemy goes for (2,5), we're moving in opposite directions, so less chance of collision.\n\nThat seems safer.\n\nAlso, by moving right, I'm moving away from the enemy, which is a good strategy to avoid confrontation.\n\nAdditionally, by going for (8,5), I might be able to pick up another apple at (8,5), and perhaps position myself to go for (0,8) next, or (7,1), depending on how the game progresses.\n\nWait, but (8,5) is the only apple in that general direction. The others are more to the left and down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (0,8) first, as it's the top-left corner, and the enemy is in the middle.\n\nFrom (6,9) to (0,8):\n\n- Move left to (5,9)\n\n- Move left to (4,9)\n\n- Move left to (3,9)\n\n- Move left to (2,9)\n\n- Move left to (1,9)\n\n- Move left to (0,9)\n\n- Move down to (0,8)\n\nThat's 6 left and 1 down.\n\nBut the enemy is at (4,7), so when I'm moving left, I might cross its path if it's moving up.\n\nAlternatively"
