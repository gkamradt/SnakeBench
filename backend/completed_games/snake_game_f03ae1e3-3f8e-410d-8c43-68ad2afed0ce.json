However, enemy snake #2 is close by at (4, 8), just one square diagonally down and to the left. If I go DOWN, there's a risk the enemy snake could block me.\n\nLooking at the other apples, (6, 8) is relatively close too, but going RIGHT then UP would put me adjacent to the enemy snake which is risky. The apple at (2, 1) is further away but has a safer path.\n\nStrategy for next turns: Stay away from the edges and the enemy snake to avoid getting trapped. Prioritize safer apples even if further away. Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nFor this turn, I'll go the safer route and avoid engaging with the enemy snake this early.\n\nMy move: DOWN"

There's also an apple at (5, 6) which is two steps down and one step to the right. However, going down would put me in a position where I'd have to navigate around the enemy snake at (5, 9).\n\nConsidering the board state, I think my best option is to go for the apple at (6, 8) since it's the closest and doesn't require me to navigate around the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (6, 8), I'll reassess the board state and consider going for the apple at (5, 6) or trying to get to the top-right corner where there's an apple at (9, 6).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
