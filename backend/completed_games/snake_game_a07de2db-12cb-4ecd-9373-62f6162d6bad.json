Direct path to apple is clear\n2. Moving RIGHT will bring me closer to the (7, 2) apple\n3. Open board provides good mobility\n4. No immediate risks of collision\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Clear path to apple\n- No obstacles blocking movement\n- Plenty of board space for maneuvering\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- Continue tracking (7, 2) apple\n- Be prepared to adjust if unexpected obstacles appear\n- Maintain flexible movement options\n\nThinking out loud: The RIGHT move continues to be the most logical and direct path to the nearest apple.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
