However, moving UP twice also puts me nearer to the enemy snake, depending on its movements.\n- Moving LEFT twice to head toward (2, 3) then UP twice to (2, 5) is a strategy that gets me an apple while keeping some distance from the enemy, although it has the downside of being slightly longer.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\n- Assuming I choose to aim for the apple at (2,5), moving UP first keeps open the most options, letting me adapt based on the changing positions, and direct towards the apple in subsequent moves.\n\nDecided Move: UP."

Also considering the enemy's potential movements, a vertical approach (UP/DOWN) might be risky if Snake #2 moves towards the central area.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\n- After moving LEFT this turn, I'll evaluate the need to move LEFT again or adjust direction based on the new position of the enemy snake and potential new apples or game developments.\n\nDecided Move: LEFT."

If still safe, moving UP to reach and consume the apple at (2, 5) will be the subsequent action.

The apple at (0, 3) is in a straightforward path downwards which simplifies navigation and reduces immediate risk from the enemy snake.\n- The enemy snake #2 is located far away towards the top right of the board (4, 9).
