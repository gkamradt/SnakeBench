My path to (9, 5) is (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (6, 7) -> (5, 7) -> ... (9, 5).  This seems clear.\n\n(4, 7) is also relatively close, but the path to (9,5) has fewer potential collisions.\n\nMy best option is to move DOWN, towards (9, 5).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue prioritizing the closest apple, considering enemy positions and avoiding collisions.
