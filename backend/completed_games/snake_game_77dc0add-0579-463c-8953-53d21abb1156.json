Additionally, if the enemy snake decides to follow me, moving up will also provide me with the opportunity to move to the right and come down towards the apple, while the enemy will be forced to go around. \n\nAnother thing to notice about going UP is that it also provides me an opportunity to go for the apple at (6, 2) in case the enemy snake decides to go for the apple at (7, 5). This way, I will still have an opportunity to grow even if I don't get the apple at (7, 5).\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is still very minimalistic without a body, which makes my snake less vulnerable to a trap. Despite this apparent safety, it is not wise to underestimate the enemy snake. I need to be vigilant about its movements and adjust the course if necessary. \n\nDirection: UP.\nRationale: As mentioned above, moving UP keeps me away from the enemy snake, provides a clear path to the nearest apple and gives me an alternate path to another apple. It is the safest direction to continue moving towards at the moment. \n\nStrategy for the next turn: I will keep a close eye on snake #2's movements. If it keeps following me, but still stays on the lower side, I will start moving RIGHT. If it moves UP and tries to give me a fight for the apple, I'll keep moving UP until it's safe to change directions.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

I see that there are apples at (7, 5), (6, 2), (8, 4), (1, 0), and (3, 2). I also see that there's an enemy snake at (8, 9) with a body at [], but I don't think I'll run into it since it's at the top right corner of the board.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to get closer to one of the apples. I think I'll head towards the apple at (7, 5) since it's relatively close to my current position.\n\nI'll think out loud: \"Hmm, I could move down to (6, 6) and then move right to (7, 6) and then down to (7, 5) to get to the apple. That seems like a good plan.\"\n\nMy decided next move is: DOWN"
