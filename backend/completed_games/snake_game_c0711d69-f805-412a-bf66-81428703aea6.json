Safe.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apples and safety:\n\nThe apples are at (7, 2), (5, 0), (8, 1), (6, 4), (1, 0).\n(7, 2) is down and left.\n(5, 0) is down and left.\n(8, 1) is down.\n(6, 4) is down and left.\n(1, 0) is down and left.\n\nMoving right leads to the edge.\nMoving up is safe.\nMoving down is safe.\n\nLet's consider moving down towards the apple at (8,1).\n\nNext turn: If the apple at (8,1) is still there, try to grab it. Otherwise, start moving towards the group of apples near (1,0).\n\nDOWN"
