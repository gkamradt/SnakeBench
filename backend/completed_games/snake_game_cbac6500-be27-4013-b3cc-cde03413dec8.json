I should avoid this move as it puts me in direct line with the enemy snake.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (1, 2))**: This space is empty, moving down would be a safe option and is away from the enemy while still keeping options for future moves.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (0, 3))**: This space is empty, and moving left would keep me close to the edge of the board, allowing potential moves downwards towards the apples at (0, 0).\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (2, 3))**: Moving right means returning to my previous position, which is not strategic.\n\n### Strategic Insight:\nMoving DOWN to (1, 2) seems like the best and safest option. This keeps my snake further away from the enemy snake, avoids confrontation, and maintains options to maneuver towards other apples in subsequent moves.

However, I need to consider the potential movements of the enemy snake and ensure I don't get trapped or run into it.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (1, 3) with its body at [(2, 3), (3, 3)]. It might continue moving towards the apple at (0, 0) or change its direction to target the apple at (1, 1). If it moves LEFT, it could potentially block my path to the apple at (1, 8).\n\nTo reach the apple at (1, 8), I have two options:\n\n1. Continue moving UP to (1, 7) and then to (1, 8) in the next turn. This path is straightforward and keeps me close to the left wall, reducing the risk of running into the enemy snake.\n\n2. Move RIGHT to (2, 6) and then move UP in the next turn, approaching the apple from the right side. This path would allow me to keep some distance from the wall but might put me at a higher risk of encountering the enemy snake if it decides to move towards the center of the board.\n\nConsidering the current situation, continuing to move UP seems to be the safest and most efficient choice. It will allow me to reach the apple at (1, 8) in the next turn while minimizing the risk of running into the enemy snake or getting trapped.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP, move UP one more time to reach the apple at (1, 8). Once I have eaten the apple, reassess the situation and decide on the next target based on the enemy snake's position and the remaining apples on the board. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movements and be prepared to adjust my strategy if it starts to approach me or block my path to the remaining apples.\n\nUP"

Not immediately useful but still an option.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (4, 2)):**\n   - This space is empty as well. Similar to the previous decision.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (3, 3)):**\n   - This space is empty. Continuing in this direction is backward as it does not further my objective of reaching an apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (5, 3)):**\n   - This takes me back to my previous position; not a good move.\n\n### Strategy Evaluation:\nIn light of my immediate goal of reaching an apple, I need to orient my movement towards increasing my proximity to (1, 3), which is the closest apple. I have noted that apples are located primarily in the first column, thus moving in a way that sets me up to the left would be most beneficial in the long term.\n\n### Best Course of Action:\nTo achieve my goal, I should move **LEFT to (3, 3)**.

Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movements and be prepared to change course if it starts moving towards the same apple. If the path to (8, 5) becomes blocked or too risky, consider switching the target to the apple at (0, 0). Prioritize collecting apples safely while avoiding confrontation with the enemy snake. Stay aware of the board state and adjust the strategy as needed to maximize points and survive.\n\nRIGHT"

The space above me (3, 7) is occupied by this enemy.\n\n### Now What?\n1. Moving UP to (3, 7) would result in a collision with the enemy snake.\n2. **Moving DOWN (to (3, 5))** would direct me back to my last position which is invalid and not allowable.\n3. **Moving LEFT (to (2, 6))** is clear; however, it leaves me farther from the apples that I want to pursue later.\n4. **Moving RIGHT (to (4, 6))** is also clear: this allows me to position myself closer to the right side of the board which has an apple at (8, 5).\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\nSince I am already in a position where I can\u2019t move up or down without running into something, I should make a move that positions me for future opportunities to collect apples without putting myself in danger. \n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 6) not only keeps my snake safe from collisions but also facilitates access to areas where more apples could be. \n\n### Conclusion:\nI will move RIGHT to (4, 6).\n\nDecided Next Move: **RIGHT**."

The enemy snake has moved to (3, 7) with its body at [(3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)], which means it is also heading towards the apple at (8, 5).\n\nGiven the current situation, I have two potential strategies:\n\n1. Continue moving RIGHT towards the apple at (8, 5) and hope to reach it before the enemy snake. This could be risky if the enemy snake moves faster or cuts me off.\n\n2. Change my target to the apple at (0, 0) and start moving DOWN. This would allow me to avoid direct competition with the enemy snake and potentially score points safely.\n\nConsidering the risk of confrontation with the enemy snake and the possibility of being blocked, I think it's wise to change my strategy and go for the apple at (0, 0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Start moving DOWN towards the apple at (0, 0). Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements, but focus on reaching the bottom-left corner safely. If the path remains clear, continue moving DOWN in the next turns until I reach the apple. Adjust the strategy if the enemy snake starts moving towards (0, 0) as well.\n\nDOWN"

There is a chance that the enemy snake might cut me off if it moves LEFT and then DOWN, blocking my path to the apple.\n\nDespite these risks, I believe that moving DOWN is still the best option, as it allows me to make progress towards the apple at (0, 0) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (0, 0). Monitor the enemy snake's movements closely. If it starts moving towards the apple or tries to cut me off, be prepared to adjust my strategy.
