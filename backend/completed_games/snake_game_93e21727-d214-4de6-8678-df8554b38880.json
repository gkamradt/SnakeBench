Given the current board state, there are three apples within reach without having to navigate around the enemy snake or the walls. The closest apple to our snake is at (4, 3), which is directly to the right of our current position.\n\nTo plan our next moves, we should consider the positions of the other apples and potential paths to collect them after picking up the nearest one. We should also be aware of the enemy snake's position, although it is currently not in our immediate path.\n\nHere's a strategy to consider:\n1. Move right to collect the apple at (4, 3).\n2. After collecting that apple, we will be at (4, 3) facing right. We should then turn up towards the apple at (5, 7).\n3. After collecting the apple at (5, 7), we should move left to (4, 7), then down to (4, 6), collecting the apple at (4, 6) if it respawns there after being eaten.\n4. From (4, 6), we can move left to collect the apple at (1, 0), ensuring we don't run into the enemy snake at (9, 8) by taking a path that keeps us at a safe distance.\n\nFollowing this strategy, our next move should be to the right to collect the nearest apple.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
