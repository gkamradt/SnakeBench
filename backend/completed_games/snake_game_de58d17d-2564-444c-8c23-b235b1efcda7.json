The left move is not possible because of the enemy.\n2. The right is off the board.\n3. The down move is off the board as well.\n4. The only viable option is to move UP.\n\nBy moving UP to (9, 1), I maintain my safety without any penalties. While this doesn\u2019t get me an apple, it allows me to set up for future moves without immediate danger. \n\n### Next move:\nI will move UP."

However, I also need to be careful about the other snakes, especially Snake #1 at (9, 0).\n\nMy current position is at the top right corner of the board, and I need to move towards the center to increase my chances of finding more apples. I also need to avoid running into the wall or the other snakes.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the center of the board, trying to find a good position to grow and gain more points.\n\nConsidering my options, I think I'll move down to (8, 1) to get closer to the center of the board and to avoid running into Snake #1. This move also gives me a chance to grow and gain more points if I'm lucky.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
