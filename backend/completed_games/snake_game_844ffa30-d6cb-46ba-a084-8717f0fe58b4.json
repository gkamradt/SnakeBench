This puts me one step closer to the apple without risking collision with any walls or snakes since no enemy is horizontally aligned with me on this row, and there are no other obstructions directly to my left.\n\nNext steps and considerations after reaching (3, 9):\n- Once I reach and eat the apple at (2, 9), I will need to assess the nearest safe apple to target. The apples at (0, 3) and (1, 4) are relatively close vertically, though they require a move downwards and could be less straightforward depending on the position of Snake #2.\n- I must keep an eye on the movement of Snake #2 which is currently at (9, 5) to predict its path and ensure it doesn't intercept a route I plan to take.\n- Focus will also be needed to maintain an escape route open to avoid being trapped between walls, the enemy snake, or my tail as I grow after consuming apples.\n\nStrategy for Future Turns:\n- Focus on reaching the nearest apple while maintaining an escape route.\n- Analyze the movement of Snake #2 to predict future risks.\n- Assess the map after each apple is eaten to determine the next target based on proximity and safety.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Their short size makes them currently less of a blocking hazard but their movements should still be monitored.\n- The apples at (1, 4), (8, 4), and (9, 8) will be targets after I've safely secured the apple at (0, 3).\n- Planning an escape route and remaining adaptable is key, as the game environment may change with each turn.\n\nMy immediate move: LEFT to reach (2, 9) where the apple is located, scoring a point and growing the snake.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

My position is now at (2, 9), freshly after consuming the apple at this coordinate, which increases my snake's length and score.\n\n**Analysis of the Current Board State & Immediate Strategy:**\n1. **Immediately Available Apple:** The nearest apple is now at (1, 6). This is 3 rows below my current position. If I move DOWN three steps consecutively starting from next move, I can consume this apple without conflict from walls or enemy snakes based on the current board layout.\n   \n2. **Next Target Apples:** \n   - The apple at (1, 4) would be the subsequent closest target after (1, 6).\n   - The apples at the far right of the board, specifically at (8, 4) and (9, 8), are distance-wise less optimal for immediate targeting unless absolutely necessary due to enemy position or a lack of closer apples.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Movements:** Currently, the enemy snake at (9, 7) poses no direct threat as it's far removed from my strategic path and has no recorded body length that could block paths or trap my snake. It's crucial to monitor its growth and path to intercept any potential conflict zones.\n\n4. **Maneuverability and Safety:** Moving DOWN now enhances the direct path to collect the apple without jeopardizing board edge proximity. Careful attention should be paid to prevent being boxed near board edges or in corners by growing enemy snakes, which could significantly reduce manageable movement options.\n\nMy current move is distinctly clear: navigate directly south to reduce my Y coordinate by 1, setting up for a subsequent approach towards the apple located at (1, 6).\n\n**Next Move Decision:** DOWN. Following this, I will continue moving DOWN until I either need to adjust due to enemy movements or have successfully reached and consumed the apple at (1, 6). The selection of future moves thereafter will depend on the updated board state with a tentative plan heading towards (1, 4)."
