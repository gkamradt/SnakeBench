This route avoids the enemy snake and any walls.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (7, 2), I will be at (7, 2), and I should then consider moving down to (7, 1) to position myself to collect the apple at (8, 0) on the next move by going right to (8, 1). This strategy keeps me clear of the enemy snake and potential self-collision.\n\nTherefore, my immediate plan is to move up to (4, 3), then right to (4, 4), and then up twice to (7, 2). After collecting that apple, I will move down to (7, 1) and then right to (8, 1) to collect the next apple.\n\nNext move: UP to (4, 3)."

The closest apple to pursue next is approximately down the x-axis toward (5, 0).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves from (5, 6):\n1. **UP to (5, 7)**: Again, this would be backtracking, which I cannot do.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 5)**: This will revert my progress toward the target apple.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 6)**: Safe and avoids any immediate conflicts but drifts me horizontally away from the target.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 6)**: This position also doesn\u2019t lead directly toward the apple but remains safe.\n\nGiven that I cannot backtrack for this turn, and moving horizontally (LEFT or RIGHT) doesn't strategically move toward my goals, my only productive moves are downwards or staying put.\n\n### Defensive Strategy:\nCurrently, my best play appears to be **DOWN to (5, 5)** once again, allowing me to reposition for upcoming moves toward (5, 0). I need to keep focused on the potential apple collections and avoid any aggression from enemy snakes.\n\nIn summary, while moving down to (5, 5) again feels less advanced, it allows for a more strategic positioning for the next turn to collect towards (5, 0) efficiently. \n\n**Decided Next Move**: DOWN"
