I can't move towards it directly because it's to the left. The apple at (0, 1) is still to the left, but I can't reach it yet because I'm currently above it. The apple at (9, 6) is too far away and moving towards it would take too many turns. The apple at (8, 8) is still blocked by another snake.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3, 4) is not a direct threat as it doesn't seem to be moving towards me. However, I should still be careful not to collide with it.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I should continue moving towards the apple at (2, 0) while avoiding the enemy snake at (3, 4). I can do this by moving left, which will bring me closer to the apple while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
