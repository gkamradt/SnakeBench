This move is safe, maximizes the immediate reward, and sets up a path to the next apple.\n\nStrategically, after collecting this apple, my next move should be planned to optimize the path towards (1, 7) while considering the elongation of my snake body and continued safe navigation. Depending on the situation next turn, a move LEFT could be considered to approach the other apple.\n\n**Next Move**: DOWN to move to (2, 6) and collect the apple."
