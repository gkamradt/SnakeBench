To do this, I will need to move left and then up. However, I must ensure that the enemy snake does not pose a threat by moving left towards me. I will need to observe its next move before committing to this strategy. If it moves left or up, I can safely move left on my next turn. If it moves down or right, I may need to reconsider my approach to avoid a collision.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Observe the enemy snake's move and aim to move towards the apple at (1, 5), potentially moving left first if it is safe to do so."

However, moving down again would not be safe because it would put me in a position where I could potentially run into the enemy snake, which is currently at (5, 1) and could move down on its next turn.\n\nTherefore, I should avoid moving down and instead consider moving up to create distance from the enemy snake and to align myself with the apple at (1, 5) for future moves. Moving left or right is not advisable at the moment because it does not bring me closer to any apples and could potentially put me in a dangerous position if the enemy snake moves horizontally.\n\nSo, the best move at this point is to move up, which will put me at (3, 3).

To do this, I will need to move left and then up. However, I must ensure that the enemy snake does not pose a threat by moving left towards me. I will need to observe its next move before committing to this strategy. If it moves left or up, I can safely move left on my next turn. If it moves down or right, I may need to reconsider my approach to avoid a collision.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Observe the enemy snake's move and aim to move towards the apple at (1, 5), potentially moving left first if it is safe to do so."

Given the current positions of the apples and the enemy snake, the closest apple to me is at (3, 2), which is directly below my current position at (3, 5). \n\nMoving down (DECREASING y coordinate) to collect this apple seems to be the best immediate strategy. It does not put me in danger of hitting the enemy snake, as snake #2 is currently at (4, 1) and moving vertically downwards does not cross its path. It also does not put me at risk of hitting the wall, as the wall is at y=0 and my current y coordinate is 5, so I have enough space to move down safely.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 2), I will need to consider my next move carefully. I should avoid moving directly left or right after collecting this apple, as it would put me on a collision course with the enemy snake at its current trajectory. Instead, I should look to move upwards after collecting the apple to put some distance between myself and the enemy snake, and to position myself for the next move.\n\nTherefore, my next move is DOWN to collect the apple at (3, 2), and my strategy for the subsequent move will be to go UP to ensure I am not on a collision course with the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

It also prevents me from getting too close to the bottom wall, which would limit my future movements.\n\nBy moving up and then planning to move right, I will be aligning myself with the apples at (7, 7), (7, 2), and (8, 2), setting up a direct path to collect them after I consume the apple at (7, 7).

The apple at (7, 7) is within reach, and I should aim to collect it without putting myself in danger.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position at (6, 6), it is two moves away from me if it decides to move up or left. Therefore, I need to be cautious not to move into a position where I could be intercepted by the enemy snake on its next move.\n\nThe apples at (8, 2), (8, 0), and (1, 5) are further away, but I should plan a route that allows me to collect them after securing the closer ones. The apple at (2, 6) is also within reach after I collect the one at (7, 7).\n\nGiven these considerations, my next move should be:\n\nRIGHT to (7, 7) to collect the apple. This move is safe as it does not put me in immediate danger of colliding with the enemy snake or the walls. After collecting this apple, I will have to reassess the board to determine my next move, which will likely be UP to (6, 7) to continue moving towards the next apple while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (7, 7), I will move UP to (6, 7) to avoid the enemy snake and position myself to collect the next apple. I will need to keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adjust my strategy to collect the remaining apples while avoiding a collision. My priority will be to collect the apples in a safe and efficient manner."
