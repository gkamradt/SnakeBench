Additionally, moving right will also give me more options to move up or down in the future, whereas moving left might limit my options.\n\nMy strategy for next turn will be to try to get to the apple at (5, 2) and then reassess the situation.\n\nMy decided next move is: RIGHT."

The only potential threat is if the snake moves into a position where it could collide with itself or the walls.\n- **Closest Apples**: The closest apples are at (2, 1) and (1, 8). Moving towards these apples would be beneficial.\n- **Strategy**: Since the snake is currently at the top-right corner, moving towards the bottom-left corner (where the apples are) is the most efficient path.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n- **UP**: Moves to (8, 9)\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (9, 8)\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (0, 9) - This would be out of bounds.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (9, 10) - This would be out of bounds.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best move is to move UP, as it brings the snake closer to the apples and does not risk going out of bounds.\n\n**End of thought process.**\n\n**Decided next move: UP**"
