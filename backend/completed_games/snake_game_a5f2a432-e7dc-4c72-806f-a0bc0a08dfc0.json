The closest apple to me is at (7, 3), which is relatively close, but I also see a potential threat from snake #1, which is at (5, 2).\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the closest apple, which is at (7, 3), while keeping an eye on snake #1. I'll try to position myself in a way that I can potentially eat the apple and avoid any potential conflicts with snake #1.\n\nThinking out loud, I'm considering moving right to get closer to the apple at (7, 3). I'll try to move in a way that I can potentially eat the apple and then reassess the situation.\n\nMy decided next move: RIGHT."
