None of these apples are directly adjacent to my current position, so I need to think about how to get to them.\n\nSince I'm in the middle of the board, I have a relatively safe position. I don't have any immediate threats from other snakes, and I'm not in danger of running into myself.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to get closer to the apples. I'll aim to move towards the one at (4, 4), which is relatively close to my current position.\n\nTo get to (4, 4), I need to move right. \n\nMy decided next move is: RIGHT."
