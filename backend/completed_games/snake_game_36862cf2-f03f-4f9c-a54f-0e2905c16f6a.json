Moving here increases the risk of a collision, especially if the enemy moves strategically.\n   - **Opportunity:** Proximity to the enemy could be leveraged for strategic positioning, but it's a higher-risk move.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Prioritize Apple Collection:** The closest apple at (5, 0) is within reachable distance. Collecting it not only grants a point but also allows your snake to grow longer, providing more flexibility in future moves.\n- **Avoiding Collisions:** Moving further away from enemy snakes reduces the risk of unintended collisions. However, proximity to enemies near high-value targets (like apples) can be advantageous if navigated carefully.\n- **Path Planning:** Ensure that after collecting an apple, you have multiple escape routes to avoid getting cornered by enemy snakes or walls.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (4, 0) is the safest and most strategic option.

Moving here would result in a collision with yourself.\n   - **Conclusion:** **Unsafe.**\n\n4. **DOWN to (5, -1):**\n   - **Risk:** This move would take the snake outside the board boundaries, resulting in a collision with the wall.\n   - **Conclusion:** **Unsafe.**\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Apple Collection:** Both UP and RIGHT moves position the snake favorably to collect nearby apples, which are crucial for gaining points and increasing snake length.\n- **Avoiding Collisions:** Both directions are currently safe, but it's essential to plan subsequent moves to prevent getting trapped by walls or enemy snakes.\n- **Navigational Flexibility:** Moving UP offers more vertical flexibility, while moving RIGHT offers horizontal progression towards multiple apples.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth **UP** to (5, 1) and **RIGHT** to (6, 0) are safe and strategically sound moves. However, moving **RIGHT** positions the snake closer to multiple apples and opens pathways towards higher concentration areas of apples, making it slightly more advantageous in the current scenario.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

However, moving **RIGHT** positions the snake closer to multiple apples and opens pathways towards higher concentration areas of apples, making it slightly more advantageous in the current scenario.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

Moving here increases the risk of a collision, especially if the enemy moves strategically.\n   - **Opportunity:** Proximity to the enemy could be leveraged for strategic positioning, but it's a higher-risk move.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Prioritize Apple Collection:** The closest apple at (5, 0) is within reachable distance. Collecting it not only grants a point but also allows your snake to grow longer, providing more flexibility in future moves.\n- **Avoiding Collisions:** Moving further away from enemy snakes reduces the risk of unintended collisions. However, proximity to enemies near high-value targets (like apples) can be advantageous if navigated carefully.\n- **Path Planning:** Ensure that after collecting an apple, you have multiple escape routes to avoid getting cornered by enemy snakes or walls.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (4, 0) is the safest and most strategic option. It sets you on the path to collect the nearest apple while minimizing immediate collision risks.\n\n**Next Move:** DOWN"
