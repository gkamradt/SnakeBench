Not allowed.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (3, 7)):**\n   - This will take me back to my previous position. Reversing is not beneficial, and I'd lose my turn. Not allowed.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (2, 8)):**\n   - This move places me away from available apples and directly does not have any apple. It also places me in line towards the enemy snake\u2019s y-coordinate.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (4, 8)):**\n   - This move positions me one coordinate to the right. Although it does not bring me closer to any apple directly, it opens up opportunities to move down toward (4, 3) on subsequent turns. Importantly, it keeps my options open while distancing from the enemy\u2019s value.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince moving UP is out of bounds (dead), moving DOWN is not strategic (reversing), and moving LEFT brings potential risk, my best option is to move RIGHT (to (4, 8)). From this position, next turns will present more viable opportunities to approach the apples while keeping away from the enemy.\n\nThus, my selected move is: **RIGHT**."

The enemy snake is at (2, 3), so I need to avoid moving down, as it would bring me closer to it (in y coordinates).\n3.

Alternatively, moving down (to (2, 6)) will yield no immediate benefits and puts me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nConsidering the above, my best option seems to be moving **RIGHT** to (3, 7), as this keeps me engaged with the board and maintains my distance from the enemy snake while also positioning me towards potential future moves towards collecting apples.\n\n**Proposed Move:**\nDirection: RIGHT"
