However, since it has no body, it can only block rather than form any closing shapes.\n3. **Potential Threats**: There's a direct path still available. Snake #2's current location (5, 7) does pose a potential block if it decides to obstruct access to (3, 7).\n4. **Future Strategy Needs**: I should consider the possibility of an intercept if Snake #2 moves down intending for one of the scattered apples. I must be prepared to adjust or even confront if necessary, perhaps repurposing strategy to head for reachable apples on my planned route.\n\n### Next Step Plan:\n\n1. I will continue moving **LEFT** from (6, 7) to (5, 7).

Monitor the enemy's position and potential future movements.\n3. **Safety Margin**: Maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake but also consider future moves to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Current Board State Analysis:\n- **Apple at (5, 3)**: Already in the line of sight and moving towards,hand the snake remains a direct path upwards.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Positioned at (6, 8) with the body, so any movement to avoid being susceptible to get in contact.\n- Board constraints with coordinates will always be the main thing\n\n### Bookkeeping:\n- **Closest Apple**: Still at (5, 3)\n- Apple is one step away, relative safest considering our previous steps\n\nNext Move is still to move upwards to the closest apple:\n\n### Next Move:\nUP"
