If I move UP, I could reach the apple in 3 moves but I would be keeping a safe distance from the snake. \n\nI am deciding to move UP since in 3 moves I can reach the apple at (1, 8) and also if the enemy snake decides to go for the apple at (7, 2) or (7, 3), I would have a clear path to the apple at (1, 8) without the risk of running into the enemy snake.  \n\nDecided next move: UP."

If it chooses to head upwards, there are no apples in that direction which would cause it to lose valuable time. \n\nGiven my current position and the position of the enemy snake, I believe that continuing to move UP is the best decision as it gets me closer to the apple at (1, 8). I also won't be in any immediate danger from the enemy snake as there seems plenty of space between us. If the enemy snake decides to move towards the apples on right, on next turn I could consider moving left to grab the apple at (1, 8). \n\nDecided next move: UP."

The presented board configuration has apples at places (7, 2), (1, 8), (7, 3), (0, 8), and (0, 0). The opposing snake's last known position was (7, 4), and since their previous trajectory is unavailable, they could potentially be at (7, 5) if it moved UP, (6, 4) if it moved LEFT, (8, 4) if it moved RIGHT, or (7, 3) if it moved DOWN. \n\nGiven the current position, I could only move LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN accordingly avoiding collision with the wall. The nearest apple(rated by shortest Manhattan distance) to my current position is at (1, 8) and it is 2 steps away. However, as my move options are narrowed due to my position on the board, I will have to turn LEFT or RIGHT first before heading down to the apple. \n\nAs for the enemy snake, they might go DOWN to consume apples at (7, 3) and (7, 2), providing they don't collide with the wall or go for the apple at (0, 8) if they move LEFT.\n\nA beneficial move for me would be to go LEFT to avoid any potential collision with the enemy snake and get closer to the apple at (1, 8). Once I reach a safer position, I can proceed downwards to consume the apple(s). By doing this, the opponent snake might be driven to go to a farther location to find the next apple reducing its score gaining speed. \n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

As my current position is far from the enemy snake, I will focus on consuming the apples closest to me.\n\nMy strategy for the next move: As I am in a position where movement is not needed to gain a point, the recommended move would be to consume the apple at my location.
