However, the enemy snake's path to the apple on the left is still longer than mine, making this unlikely. Also, it would also be strategically suboptimal for it to move away from the apple at (5, 7).\n\nWith all this in mind, moving down or right doesn't get me any closer to the apples and endangers me by potentially being in line with the enemy snake's path. Moving up doesn't make much sense, logically, as there are no apples there, just the enemy snake.\n\nFor my strategy for the next turn, I will evaluate the positions of both the apples and the enemy snake. If I manage to consume the apple at (1, 4), which is likely, I will consider two scenarios:\n\n 1) If the enemy snake has moved left, I will move up to consume the next apple at (1, 5).\n 2) If the enemy snake has moved down, I will move left towards the apple at (0, 7).\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT."
