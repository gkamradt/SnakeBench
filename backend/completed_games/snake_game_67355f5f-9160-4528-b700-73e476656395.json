There are no nearby threats that necessitate defensive play, allowing for an offensive strategy to maximize growth.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

My snake is currently at (7, 5) and based on my last analysis and the subsequent apple positions as well as the positions of the enemy snake, I need to make a calculated move.\n\n### Current Board Situation\n- **Position of Snake #1 (Me)**: (7, 5)\n- **Immediate Apple Target**: (7, 8) directly above\n- **Enemy Snake Position**: (4, 8) with its body at (4, 7)\n\n### Possible Moves\n1. **UP (7, 6)**: Already occupied by myself (not valid).\n2. **DOWN (7, 4)**: While valid, it moves away from the apple.\n3. **LEFT (6, 5)**: A safe move, but it does not progress toward the apple.\n4. **RIGHT (8, 5)**: Also a safe move but again does not bring me closer to the apple.\n\n### Apple Strategy\nThe important goal is to move toward the apple located at (7, 8). Since UP is occupied and the other options do not immediately help in reaching the apple, I have only the option to move horizontally. \n\n### Option Evaluation\n- **Moving LEFT to (6, 5)**: Safe, but effectively puts me further away from any apple, which could escalate into a potential issue as turns progress.\n- **Moving RIGHT to (8, 5)**: This move is preferable since it allows me to avoid being backed too far away from the apple at (7, 8) directly above.\n\n### Immediate Coordination\nSince the left move is essentially a distraction from my main goal of reaching the apple, I shall choose to move RIGHT to (8, 5) instead.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT."
