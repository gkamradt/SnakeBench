Here's a quick look:\n- The nearest apple to your snake is currently at (0, 1). It\u2019s directly below you along the y-axis.\n- Other apples are positioned at (2, 4), (6, 1), (8, 3), and (8, 7), which are more toward the right side and farther from your current position.\n\nYour primary objectives should be:\n1. Avoid hitting walls and the enemy snake.\n2. Acquire the closest apple.\n3. Make a path for future apple acquisitions.\n\nSince moving UP or LEFT isn't beneficial (moving UP you will move off the board and LEFT does not change row), and moving RIGHT does not get you nearer to any immediate apple and potentially takes you into longer paths which might be riskier initially. \n\nThus, considering that Snake #2 is far away from you, staying away from it and focusing on gathering apples is a good tactic at this moment.\n\nObserving the board and paths, your best move now is:\n- DOWN, to move toward the apple at (0, 1). This move is direct and secure, ensuring food collection and avoiding any immediate threats.\n\n**Next Move:** DOWN"

Moving right to this apple would immediately make us grow and give us points without requiring us to change our direction drastically. After taking this apple, we can go down to (8, 3) and then to (6, 1). This way, we can secure three apples quickly.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n\nAfter taking the apple at (8, 7), I will go straight down to (8, 3), then move left to (6, 1) to secure the next two apples quickly.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
