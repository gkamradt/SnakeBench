To get there, I should shift my snake to the LEFT towards the apple on my current plane then maneuver upward. However, a move to the LEFT will decrease my x-coordinate leading my snake straight to the grid wall. This would be against the rules as it would result in failure due to a collision with the wall.\n\nGiven the position of the enemy snake #2, it is doubtful that it could reach the apple at (3, 9) before my snake if I move UP then to the LEFT. Since the snake #2 is closer to the apples on the bottom row at (0, 1), (5, 1), and (8, 1), it is more likely to go for one of those instead due to their proximity.\n\nSo my plan instead is to first move UP to increase my y-coordinate from 9 to 10. Then I can easily navigate my snake to the LEFT to attain the apple at (3, 9). \nMoving UP will not bring me into potential conflict with the enemy snake, and the snake can't move backwards into me. \n\nNext move: UP."
