However, it also slightly increases the risk of encountering Snake #2 which is at (7, 7).\n- **DOWN (to 1, 5)**: This move goes further away from any apples and is not strategically beneficial right now.\n- **LEFT (to 0, 6)**: This move brings me closer to the apple at (0, 9), but would involve moving several spaces up afterward.

Moves away from apples and the potential strategic advantage on the right. \n\n4. **RIGHT (to 5, 7)**\n   - Advances towards the apple at (6, 2) on the lower side, and also maintains the path towards (5, 9). \n   - It\u2019s crucial to remain alert for any defensive maneuvers if Snake #2 makes aggressive advances toward shared targets.\n\n### Strategic Rationale\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 7) positions me such that I can dynamically decide if approaching the apple at (6, 2) is viable or pivot upwards later if it's clear.\n- Snake #2\u2019s movement is key. If it maintains upward or rightward trajectory, this minimizes interference with my plans.\n\n### Strategic Plan for Next Turn\n- Observe Snake #2's direction closely. If it heads to its right or retreats, capitalize on the apple at (5, 9).\n- If moving aggressively forward, reconsider plans around (6, 2) to avoid conflict.\n- Keep in mind possible paths that afford safe retreat or flexible shifts based on the immediate next move of the opponent.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"
