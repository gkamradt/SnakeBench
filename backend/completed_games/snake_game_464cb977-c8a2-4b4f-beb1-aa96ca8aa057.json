            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1, currently at (7,6). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, (7,6) is somewhere in the upper middle part of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them:\n- (5,7)\n- (1,7)\n- (4,0)\n- (2,6)\n- (5,3)\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. Let me plot these positions mentally.\n\nStarting with the apple at (5,7). That's to the left and up from my current position. From (7,6), moving left would decrease my x-coordinate. So, to get to (5,7), I'd need to move left twice and up once. But I have to check if that's the best option.\n\nNext, (1,7) is further left and at the same y-coordinate. That would require moving left six times and up once. That seems like a longer path, so maybe not the best immediate target.\n\nThen there's (4,0), which is way down at the bottom. From (7,6), that's moving down six times and left three times. That's a long way, probably not the best next move.\n\nThe apple at (2,6) is directly to the left of me. From (7,6), moving left five times would get me there. That's a straight line, so that's a possible target.\n\nLastly, (5,3) is below and to the left. From (7,6), moving left twice and down three times. That's a medium distance.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (4,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it. Since my current position is (7,6), and the enemy is at (4,4), there's some space between us, but I should be cautious about moving towards areas where we might cross paths.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apples are spread out. The one at (5,7) is close in terms of y-coordinate but requires moving left. The one at (2,6) is directly left, which is a straight path. The one at (5,3) is a bit further but might be a good target after getting the closer ones.\n\nI also need to consider the direction I was moving last. The last move info says direction was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about continuity.\n\nThinking about the possible moves from (7,6):\n- Up would take me to (7,7), which is an empty space.\n- Down would take me to (7,5), also empty.\n- Left to (6,6), which is empty.\n- Right to (8,6), which is empty.\n\nSo, all directions are possible, but I need to choose the one that leads me towards an apple without risking collision.\n\nIf I go up to (7,7), that's one step towards (5,7). But I'm not sure if that's the best path because it's two steps left and one up. Alternatively, moving left to (6,6) would start me towards (2,6), which is a straight line.\n\nWait, but (2,6) is directly left, so moving left from (7,6) would be the most straightforward path. That apple is at (2,6), so moving left five times would get me there. But I have to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I might collide with myself or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (7,6) to (2,6) is clear because there are no apples or snakes in between. So, moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,7) would take me towards (5,7), but that's a diagonal move. Since I can only move in one direction each turn, I'd have to move left twice and up once, but that might take more steps.\n\nConsidering the points, each apple is worth one point, so getting the closest one first makes sense. The apple at (2,6) is directly left, so that's the closest. Therefore, moving left towards it would be the best immediate move.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to hit any part of my own body. Since my body is not mentioned, I assume it's just the head at (7,6), so moving left is safe.\n\nSo, the strategy is to move left towards (2,6) to collect that apple first, then proceed to collect others. This way, I can maximize my points without risking collision.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT towards the apple at (2,6), which is the closest and most straightforward target. This path is clear and avoids collisions with the enemy snake and walls.\n\n**LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1, currently at (7,6). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, (7,6) is somewhere in the upper middle part of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them:\n- (5,7)\n- (1,7)\n- (4,0)\n- (2,6)\n- (5,3)\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. Let me plot these positions mentally.\n\nStarting with the apple at (5,7). That's to the left and up from my current position. From (7,6), moving left would decrease my x-coordinate. So, to get to (5,7), I'd need to move left twice and up once. But I have to check if that's the best option.\n\nNext, (1,7) is further left and at the same y-coordinate. That would require moving left six times and up once. That seems like a longer path, so maybe not the best immediate target.\n\nThen there's (4,0), which is way down at the bottom. From (7,6), that's moving down six times and left three times. That's a long way, probably not the best next move.\n\nThe apple at (2,6) is directly to the left of me. From (7,6), moving left five times would get me there. That's a straight line, so that's a possible target.\n\nLastly, (5,3) is below and to the left. From (7,6), moving left twice and down three times. That's a medium distance.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (4,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it. Since my current position is (7,6), and the enemy is at (4,4), there's some space between us, but I should be cautious about moving towards areas where we might cross paths.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apples are spread out. The one at (5,7) is close in terms of y-coordinate but requires moving left. The one at (2,6) is directly left, which is a straight path. The one at (5,3) is a bit further but might be a good target after getting the closer ones.\n\nI also need to consider the direction I was moving last. The last move info says direction was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about continuity.\n\nThinking about the possible moves from (7,6):\n- Up would take me to (7,7), which is an empty space.\n- Down would take me to (7,5), also empty.\n- Left to (6,6), which is empty.\n- Right to (8,6), which is empty.\n\nSo, all directions are possible, but I need to choose the one that leads me towards an apple without risking collision.\n\nIf I go up to (7,7), that's one step towards (5,7). But I'm not sure if that's the best path because it's two steps left and one up. Alternatively, moving left to (6,6) would start me towards (2,6), which is a straight line.\n\nWait, but (2,6) is directly left, so moving left from (7,6) would be the most straightforward path. That apple is at (2,6), so moving left five times would get me there. But I have to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I might collide with myself or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (7,6) to (2,6) is clear because there are no apples or snakes in between. So, moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,7) would take me towards (5,7), but that's a diagonal move. Since I can only move in one direction each turn, I'd have to move left twice and up once, but that might take more steps.\n\nConsidering the points, each apple is worth one point, so getting the closest one first makes sense. The apple at (2,6) is directly left, so that's the closest. Therefore, moving left seems like the best immediate move.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to hit any part of my own body. Since my body is not mentioned, I assume it's just the head at (7,6), so moving left is safe.\n\nSo, the strategy is to move left towards (2,6) to collect that apple first, then proceed to collect others.

From (7,6), moving left twice and down three times. That's a medium distance.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (4,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it. Since my current position is (7,6), and the enemy is at (4,4), there's some space between us, but I should be cautious about moving towards areas where we might cross paths.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apples are spread out. The one at (5,7) is close in terms of y-coordinate but requires moving left. The one at (2,6) is directly left, which is a straight path. The one at (5,3) is a bit further but might be a good target after getting the closer ones.\n\nI also need to consider the direction I was moving last. The last move info says direction was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about continuity.\n\nThinking about the possible moves from (7,6):\n- Up would take me to (7,7), which is an empty space.\n- Down would take me to (7,5), also empty.\n- Left to (6,6), which is empty.\n- Right to (8,6), which is empty.\n\nSo, all directions are possible, but I need to choose the one that leads me towards an apple without risking collision.\n\nIf I go up to (7,7), that's one step towards (5,7). But I'm not sure if that's the best path because it's two steps left and one up. Alternatively, moving left to (6,6) would start me towards (2,6), which is a straight line.\n\nWait, but (2,6) is directly left, so moving left from (7,6) would be the most straightforward path. That apple is at (2,6), so moving left five times would get me there. But I have to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I might collide with myself or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (7,6) to (2,6) is clear because there are no apples or snakes in between. So, moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,7) would take me towards (5,7), but that's a diagonal move. Since I can only move in one direction each turn, I'd have to move left twice and up once, but that might take more steps.\n\nConsidering the points, each apple is worth one point, so getting the closest one first makes sense. The apple at (2,6) is directly left, so that's the closest. Therefore, moving left seems like the best immediate move.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to hit any part of my own body. Since my body is not mentioned, I assume it's just the head at (7,6), so moving left is safe.\n\nSo, the strategy is to move left towards (2,6) to collect that apple first, then proceed to collect others. This way, I can maximize my points without risking collision.\n\n**LEFT**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move for my snake is to move LEFT towards the apple at (2,6), which is the closest and most straightforward target.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is ID 1, currently at (7,6). The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, (7,6) is somewhere in the upper middle part of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them:\n- (5,7)\n- (1,7)\n- (4,0)\n- (2,6)\n- (5,3)\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. Let me plot these positions mentally.\n\nStarting with the apple at (5,7). That's to the left and up from my current position. From (7,6), moving left would decrease my x-coordinate. So, to get to (5,7), I'd need to move left twice and up once. But I have to check if that's the best option.\n\nNext, (1,7) is further left and at the same y-coordinate. That would require moving left six times and up once. That seems like a longer path, so maybe not the best immediate target.\n\nThen there's (4,0), which is way down at the bottom. From (7,6), that's moving down six times and left three times. That's a long way, probably not the best next move.\n\nThe apple at (2,6) is directly to the left of me. From (7,6), moving left five times would get me there. That's a straight line, so that's a possible target.\n\nLastly, (5,3) is below and to the left. From (7,6), moving left twice and down three times. That's a medium distance.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. Snake #2 is at (4,4) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. I need to make sure I don't run into it. Since my current position is (7,6), and the enemy is at (4,4), there's some space between us, but I should be cautious about moving towards areas where we might cross paths.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apples are spread out. The one at (5,7) is close in terms of y-coordinate but requires moving left. The one at (2,6) is directly left, which is a straight path. The one at (5,3) is a bit further but might be a good target after getting the closer ones.\n\nI also need to consider the direction I was moving last. The last move info says direction was None, so I can choose any direction without worrying about continuity.\n\nThinking about the possible moves from (7,6):\n- Up would take me to (7,7), which is an empty space.\n- Down would take me to (7,5), also empty.\n- Left to (6,6), which is empty.\n- Right to (8,6), which is empty.\n\nSo, all directions are possible, but I need to choose the one that leads me towards an apple without risking collision.\n\nIf I go up to (7,7), that's one step towards (5,7). But I'm not sure if that's the best path because it's two steps left and one up. Alternatively, moving left to (6,6) would start me towards (2,6), which is a straight line.\n\nWait, but (2,6) is directly left, so moving left from (7,6) would be the most straightforward path. That apple is at (2,6), so moving left five times would get me there. But I have to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I might collide with myself or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (7,6) to (2,6) is clear because there are no apples or snakes in between. So, moving left seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,7) would take me towards (5,7), but that's a diagonal move. Since I can only move in one direction each turn, I'd have to move left twice and up once, but that might take more steps.\n\nConsidering the points, each apple is worth one point, so getting the closest one first makes sense. The apple at (2,6) is directly left, so that's the closest. Therefore, moving left towards it would be the best immediate move.\n\nI should also check if moving left would cause me to hit any part of my own body. Since my body is not mentioned, I assume it's just the head at (7,6), so moving left is safe.\n\nSo, the strategy is to move left towards (2,6) to collect that apple first, then proceed to collect others. This way, I can maximize my points without risking collision.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT towards the apple at (2,6), which is the closest and most straightforward target. This path is clear and avoids collisions with the enemy snake and walls.\n\n**LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is a 10x10 grid, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is currently at (2,6), which is somewhere in the middle-left area. The enemy snake is at (9,4), which is near the top right corner, and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's just its head there.\n\nThere are five apples on the board:\n- (5,7): That's near the top middle.\n- (1,7): Also near the top but more to the left.\n- (4,0): That's at the bottom, a bit to the right.\n- (5,3): Mid-left area.\n- (4,7): Top middle-right.\n\nMy snake is at (2,6), so I need to decide which direction to move next. The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Let me evaluate each option.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (2,6), I'll go to (1,6). Is there an apple there? Looking at the list, no, there's an apple at (1,7), which is one row up. So moving left doesn't get me an apple immediately, but it might help me get closer to one.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,6), that's also not an apple. The closest apple to the right is (5,3), which is a bit further down and to the right.\n\nMoving UP from (2,6) takes me to (2,7). There's an apple at (1,7) and (5,7) on that row. So moving up could potentially get me closer to an apple, but I'm not on an apple yet.\n\nMoving DOWN from (2,6) takes me to (2,5). That's not an apple either. The closest apple below is (4,0), which is much further down.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (9,4), I need to make sure I don't get too close to it. Since it's at (9,4), which is near the top right, and I'm at (2,6), moving towards the top left or right might bring me closer, but I don't think it's an immediate threat.\n\nI also need to think about the path my snake will take in the future. If I move towards an apple, I should consider whether the path is clear and whether I can reach it without running into walls or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the apples, the one at (1,7) is only two moves up from my current position if I move up twice. The apple at (5,7) is further to the right. The apple at (4,0) is quite far down. The apple at (5,3) is to the right and down a bit.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,7), I can then move LEFT to (1,7) to get that apple. That seems like a good strategy because it's close. Alternatively, if I move RIGHT and then UP, I could go for (5,7), but that's a longer path.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy snake moving. Since it's at (9,4), it might be trying to get to an apple or block me, but without knowing its next move, I should focus on the safest path towards an apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the size of my snake. If I'm just the head at (2,6), I don't have a body to worry about, so I can move more freely. But if I grow, I'll have to be careful not to hit myself.\n\nSo, weighing the options, moving UP to (2,7) seems like a good first step because it gets me closer to the apple at (1,7) and (5,7). From there, I can decide whether to go left or right depending on which apple is more accessible.\n\nI should also make sure that moving UP doesn't put me in a position where the enemy snake could block me. Since the enemy is at (9,4), it's not directly in my path, so moving UP is safe.\n\nIn summary, moving UP will position me closer to two apples and allow me to choose the best path forward without immediate threats.\n</think>\n\n**UP**\n\n**Strategy:** Move towards the closest apple at (1,7) by first moving up to (2,7), then left to (1,7) to collect the apple."
