This path minimizes travel time while keeping risk low.\n   - After capturing the apple at (3, 8), reassess opportunities to pursue other nearby apples, specifically (5, 8) which lies directly in line, providing another quick point potential.\n\n4. **Monitoring:**\n   - Keep an eye on Snake #2\u2019s movements in case the situation changes.
