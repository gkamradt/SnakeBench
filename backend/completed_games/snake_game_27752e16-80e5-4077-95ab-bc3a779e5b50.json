The closest apple is at (7, 5), and our current position is (2, 9). A potential strategy could be to move LEFT to (2, 8) and then DOWN to (2, 5) to reach the apple. This will help us grow and potentially put us in a better position to collect more apples. As for the enemy snake (Snake #1), it's currently not an immediate threat. Our next move should be LEFT.\n\nResponse: LEFT (Direction: LEFT)"
