I also see that there are several apples within my reach, including the one at (8, 3) and (4, 9).\n\nMy current position is quite far from the other snake, which is at (1, 4). I don't see any immediate threats from it.\n\nConsidering my options, I think I'll move towards the apple at (8, 3) to gain some points and get closer to the center of the board. This will also give me more space to maneuver and potentially allow me to avoid other snakes.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards the apple at (8, 3) and see if I can find any other opportunities to collect apples or avoid other snakes.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
