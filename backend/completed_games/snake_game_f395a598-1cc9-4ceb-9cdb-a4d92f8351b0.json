There's an apple at (5, 5) directly above. This move is beneficial since you're heading towards another apple and avoiding collisions with the enemy.\n   \n2. **DOWN to (6, 5)**: \n   - This would be moving away from the apples and near walls; therefore, it's strategically less effective.\n   \n3. **LEFT to (7, 3)**:\n   - This position doesn't provide any immediate gains and puts you horizontally aligned with walls with future limited options.\n   \n4. **RIGHT to (9, 5)**: \n   - This is moving towards the edge of the board (which is bad) without gaining an apple or strategic advantage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP to (8, 5) keeps you safe and strategically positions you better towards the apple at (5, 5) on the next turn while avoiding both walls and the enemy snake. \n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn:\nPlan to move towards the remaining apples while monitoring the enemy's movements closely.

My snake occupies the space at (7, 4) and has an additional segment likely trailing behind it. I need to consider the following options:\n\n1. **Remaining Apples**:\n   - The apples at positions (4, 2) and (2, 4) are further down in the y-axis, while (5, 5) is above. \n   - My current conditions allow immediate movement to collect further apples in my future moves.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - The enemy snake is positioned at (1, 5) with no nearby body segments that pose a threat in terms of collision. \n   \n3. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **UP to (8, 5)**: Here, I would be one space above while inching closer to the apple at (5, 5), which is a consideration moving forward.\n   - **DOWN to (8, 3)**: No immediate gain and moving vertically away from apples and in the direction of a wall.\n   - **LEFT to (7, 4)**: If I interpret that trailing further means massing the fruit, this creates no advantage here as I gain nothing immediate.\n   - **RIGHT to (9, 4)**: Again, hitting the boundary of the board results in failure.\n\nSince moving UP to (8, 5) will allow me to potentially approach the apple at (5, 5) while getting away from walls and enemies, this seems to be the most strategic move. \n\nNext, I tell myself to plan a direct approach towards the nearest apples while being cautious around the enemy snake, avoiding passing coordinates that intersect with their position for future turns.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: UP."

There's an apple at (5, 5) directly above. This move is beneficial since you're heading towards another apple and avoiding collisions with the enemy.\n   \n2. **DOWN to (6, 5)**: \n   - This would be moving away from the apples and near walls; therefore, it's strategically less effective.\n   \n3. **LEFT to (7, 3)**:\n   - This position doesn't provide any immediate gains and puts you horizontally aligned with walls with future limited options.\n   \n4. **RIGHT to (9, 5)**: \n   - This is moving towards the edge of the board (which is bad) without gaining an apple or strategic advantage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP to (8, 5) keeps you safe and strategically positions you better towards the apple at (5, 5) on the next turn while avoiding both walls and the enemy snake. \n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn:\nPlan to move towards the remaining apples while monitoring the enemy's movements closely. Avoid crossing paths with the enemy and ensure to not move backward towards your own segments. \n\n#### Final Decision:\nNext move: UP."

(4, 2)\n  2. (5, 5)\n  3. (2, 4)\n  4. (0, 9)\n  \nThe most accessible apple is at **(5, 5)**, which is directly above my current position of **(7, 4)**.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n1. **UP to (8, 4)**: \n   - This would put me out of alignment with moving towards any apples on this turn, but I can't directly access **(5, 5)** since there is a wall row (the wall on the top row).\n   \n2. **DOWN to (6, 4)**: \n   - This move keeps me on track toward lower-row apples, but it moves me away from the desired apple at **(5, 5)**.\n   \n3. **LEFT to (7, 3)**:\n   - Similar to earlier, this position doesn't direct me toward apples and isolates my movement options.\n   \n4. **RIGHT to (9, 4)**: \n   - This would put me further away from all remaining apples as well.\n\n### Analyzing the Apple Strategy:\nGiven the positions of the apples, my most logical option seems to involve pursuing the apple directly above or securing the path toward **(5, 5)** on future turns. \n\nHowever, considering the constraints mentioned:\n- I could move UP to **(7, 5)** to later allow movement up to **(5, 5)** on subsequent turns.\n- But since **(8, 5)** is an accessible location and staying close to **(5, 5)** can help me potentially secure that apple next.\n\n### Direction Decision:\nThe immediate best move, given that there's no direct collision risk from the enemy and wanting to head towards an apple, seems to be moving UP to **(8, 4)**. This positions me safely, allows a move clearance toward the **(5, 5)** apple route, and maintains good gameplay flow.\n\nNext move: UP."
