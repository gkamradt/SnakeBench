            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,0). There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1). Also, there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (7,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: dots except for an apple at (6,8).\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7).\n\nRow 6: dots except for enemy snake 1 at (7,6).\n\nRow 5: dots except for an apple at (2,5).\n\nRow 4: dots except for an apple at (7,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: dots except for an apple at (6,1).\n\nRow 0: dots except for my snake at (4,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (4,0), which is in the bottom row, and there are apples scattered around the board. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying by hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple. I'm at (4,0), and the apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (2,5): |4-2| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |4-2| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- (7,4): |4-7| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,8): |4-6| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,1) with a distance of 3. Then, (2,5) and (7,4) are both at distance 7, and (2,7) and (6,8) are farther away.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet's think about moving towards (6,1). From (4,0), I need to increase X to 6 and increase Y to 1.\n\nSo, I need to move right twice and up once.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFirst, moving right to (5,0):\n\nIs (5,0) occupied? Doesn't seem like it, based on the board.\n\nThen, moving right again to (6,0):\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, moving up to (6,1), where the apple is.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), and it's possible it might move towards me or the apple.\n\nHowever, since I'm moving to (6,1), which is not near the enemy's current position, maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the next apple to go for after picking up (6,1).\n\nAfter picking up (6,1), I would have grown, so my tail will be at (4,0), then (5,0), then (6,0), and my head at (6,1).\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's look at the next closest apple.\n\nThe next closest would likely be (2,5) or (7,4), both at distance 7 from my current position.\n\nBut, after moving to (6,1), my new position is (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (6,1) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5): |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |6-2| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (7,4): |6-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (6,8): |6-6| + |1-8| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,1) is (7,4) at distance 4.\n\nThen, (6,8) at 7, (2,5) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (7,4) next.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (7,4):\n\nNeed to move right to (7,1), then up to (7,4).\n\nThat's one right and three ups.\n\nBut, again, I need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving right to (7,1):\n\nIs (7,1) occupied? Doesn't seem like it.\n\nThen, up to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n(7,4) is where the apple is.\n\nBut, the enemy snake is at (7,6), which is two steps up from (7,4).\n\nSo, after I pick up (7,4), the enemy might be at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, consider that after picking up (7,4), my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\n2. Then, move to (7,1), then (7,2), (7,3), and (7,4) to pick up the next apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider going for (2,5) instead of (7,4) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5):\n\nNeed to move left four times to (2,1), then up four times to (2,5).\n\nThat's a total of eight moves, which is more than going to (7,4), which is only four moves.\n\nSo, (7,4) is still closer.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (7,6), maybe it's safer to go for (2,5).\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6). If I go to (7,4), I'm moving closer to the enemy, which might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (2,5), I'm moving away from the enemy, which might be safer.\n\nBut, it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8):\n\nJust need to move up seven times to (6,8).\n\nThat seems straightforward, but it's a long path upwards.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8), columns 6, rows 1 to 8.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: apple at (6,1)\n\nRow 2: empty\n\nRow 3: empty\n\nRow 4: apple at (7,4), but X is 7, so adjacent but not on the same column.\n\nRow 5: apple at (2,5), but X is 2, so not in column 6.\n\nRow 6: enemy at (7,6), not in column 6.\n\nRow 7: empty\n\nRow 8: apple at (6,8)\n\nSo, column 6 from row 1 to row 8 seems clear except for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTherefore, moving up from (6,1) to (6,8) should be straightforward, picking up the apple at (6,8).\n\nBut, that's a long path, and I need to consider if the enemy might interfere.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6), which is in row 6, column 7.\n\nIf I'm at (6,6), which is directly left of the enemy, that might be dangerous.\n\nBut, I need to pass through (6,6) on my way up from (6,1) to (6,8).\n\nSo, I need to see what the enemy might do.\n\nIf the enemy moves left to (6,6), then I would be at (6,6) at the same time if I'm moving up.\n\nSo, that could cause a collision.\n\nTherefore, going straight up to (6,8) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go around the enemy.\n\nWait,"

From my current position (4,1), the apples are at:\n\n- (2,5): that's 2 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 2 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 3 steps right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 2 steps right and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): 2 steps right and 0 steps up.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be at (6,1), only 2 steps to the right. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nBut, I need to think ahead. After I get that apple, where should I go next? Let's see.\n\nIf I go to (6,1), I'll have grown longer, so I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't lead me into a dead end or into the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (7,5). I need to keep an eye on its position and try to avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or lead me closer to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nIf I go to (6,1), which is just 2 steps to the right, that seems straightforward. From there, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (6,1), the apples are:\n\n- (2,5): 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 4 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 0 steps horizontally and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): already there.\n\nSo, the next closest would be (7,4), which is just 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (7,5), which is just above (7,4). So, if I go to (7,4), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (2,5) instead, even though it's farther away.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5), it's 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\nThat's a longer path, but it might be safer to move away from the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, moving up the board could be risky because there are more apples up there, and the enemy might be moving towards them as well.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,5), which is already somewhat up the board.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8), which is directly above (6,1), but that's a long way up, and I'd have to pass through (6,2), (6,3), etc., up to (6,8).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to be in my way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (2,7), which is further left and up, but that's even farther away.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is (6,1), and then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nI should also consider that as I grow longer, I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nSo, for now, I think the best move is to go right to (5,1), then to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\nThen, I can assess the situation again and choose the next apple based on where the enemy is.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll go right to (5,1).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1). Also, there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (7,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: dots except for an apple at (6,8).\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7).\n\nRow 6: dots except for enemy snake 1 at (7,6).\n\nRow 5: dots except for an apple at (2,5).\n\nRow 4: dots except for an apple at (7,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: dots except for an apple at (6,1).\n\nRow 0: dots except for my snake at (4,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (4,0), which is in the bottom row, and there are apples scattered around the board. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying by hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple. I'm at (4,0), and the apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (2,5): |4-2| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |4-2| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- (7,4): |4-7| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,8): |4-6| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,1) with a distance of 3. Then, (2,5) and (7,4) are both at distance 7, and (2,7) and (6,8) are farther away.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet's think about moving towards (6,1). From (4,0), I need to increase X to 6 and increase Y to 1.\n\nSo, I need to move right twice and up once.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFirst, moving right to (5,0):\n\nIs (5,0) occupied? Doesn't seem like it, based on the board.\n\nThen, moving right again to (6,0):\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, moving up to (6,1), where the apple is.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), and it's possible it might move towards me or the apple.\n\nHowever, since I'm moving to (6,1), which is not near the enemy's current position, maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the next apple to go for after picking up (6,1).\n\nAfter picking up (6,1), I would have grown, so my tail will be at (4,0), then (5,0), then (6,0), and my head at (6,1).\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's look at the next closest apple.\n\nThe next closest would likely be (2,5) or (7,4), both at distance 7 from my current position.\n\nBut, after moving to (6,1), my new position is (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (6,1) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5): |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |6-2| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (7,4): |6-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (6,8): |6-6| + |1-8| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,1) is (7,4) at distance 4.\n\nThen, (6,8) at 7, (2,5) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (7,4) next.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (7,4):\n\nNeed to move right to (7,1), then up to (7,4).\n\nThat's one right and three ups.\n\nBut, again, I need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving right to (7,1):\n\nIs (7,1) occupied? Doesn't seem like it.\n\nThen, up to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n(7,4) is where the apple is.\n\nBut, the enemy snake is at (7,6), which is two steps up from (7,4).\n\nSo, after I pick up (7,4), the enemy might be at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, consider that after picking up (7,4), my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\n2. Then, move to (7,1), then (7,2), (7,3), and (7,4) to pick up the next apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider going for (2,5) instead of (7,4) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5):\n\nNeed to move left four times to (2,1), then up four times to (2,5).\n\nThat's a total of eight moves, which is more than going to (7,4), which is only four moves.\n\nSo, (7,4) is still closer.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (7,6), maybe it's safer to go for (2,5).\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6). If I go to (7,4), I'm moving closer to the enemy, which might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (2,5), I'm moving away from the enemy, which might be safer.\n\nBut, it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8):\n\nJust need to move up seven times to (6,8).\n\nThat seems straightforward, but it's a long path upwards.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8), columns 6, rows 1 to 8.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: apple at (6,1)\n\nRow 2: empty\n\nRow 3: empty\n\nRow 4: apple at (7,4), but X is 7, so adjacent but not on the same column.\n\nRow 5: apple at (2,5), but X is 2, so not in column 6.\n\nRow 6: enemy at (7,6), not in column 6.\n\nRow 7: empty\n\nRow 8: apple at (6,8)\n\nSo, column 6 from row 1 to row 8 seems clear except for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTherefore, moving up from (6,1) to (6,8) should be straightforward, picking up the apple at (6,8).\n\nBut, that's a long path, and I need to consider if the enemy might interfere.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6), which is in row 6, column 7.\n\nIf I'm at (6,6), which is directly left of the enemy, that might be dangerous.\n\nBut, I need to pass through (6,6) on my way up from (6,1) to (6,8).\n\nSo, I need to see what the enemy might do.\n\nIf the enemy moves left to (6,6), then I would be at (6,6) at the same time if I'm moving up.\n\nSo, that could cause a collision.\n\nTherefore, going straight up to (6,8) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go around the enemy.\n\nWait,"

I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (6,8) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1), moving up to (6,2), then (6,3), and so on up to (6,8).\n\nBut that's a long way up, and the enemy is already at (7,4), moving upwards.\n\nI might cross paths with the enemy.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just stick with going for the closest apple each time, while avoiding the enemy.\n\nSo, for now, move right to (6,1), then look for the next apple.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (6,1), which is right next to me.\n\nIf I move right to (6,1), I eat it and grow longer.\n\nThen, from (6,1), I can see the apple at (9,2), which is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving into my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position, it's at (7,4), and its body is at (7,5), so it might be moving upwards.\n\nIf I move right to (6,1), then right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then right to (9,1), then up to (9,2), I might be safe.\n\nLet me check the path:\n\n- (5,1) -> (6,1): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- (6,1) -> (7,1): safe, no obstacles.\n\n- (7,1) -> (8,1): safe.\n\n- (8,1) -> (9,1): safe.\n\n- (9,1) -> (9,2): eat apple.\n\nDuring this path, the enemy is at (7,4), moving upwards to (7,5), etc.\n\nSo, as long as I stay below row 4, I should be safe.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,4), and its body is at (7,5), so it's probably moving upwards.\n\nIf I stay below row 4, I shouldn't intersect with it.\n\nSo, this seems a safe path.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I can then aim for another apple.\n\nLet's see, after (9,2), the closest apple is (2,5), which is 7 left and 3 up.\n\nWait, from (9,2), moving left to (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), then up to (2,3), then (2,4), then (2,5) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a shorter path.\n\nWait, from (9,2), I could move up to (9,3), then left to (8,3), and so on, but that might not be efficient.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for one move.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on getting the closest apple, which is (6,1), and then assess the situation again.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that as I grow longer, I have to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (6,1), I eat the apple and grow longer, so my tail will extend.\n\nI need to make sure that the next move doesn't lead me back into my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, moving right to (6,1), then right to (7,1), and so on, should be safe, as I'm moving in a straight line.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movement and adjust my path accordingly.\n\nFor now, I think the best move is to move right to (6,1) and eat the apple.\n\nThen, plan the next moves based on the enemy's position.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**End of Move**"

There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1). Also, there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (7,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: dots except for an apple at (6,8).\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7).\n\nRow 6: dots except for enemy snake 1 at (7,6).\n\nRow 5: dots except for an apple at (2,5).\n\nRow 4: dots except for an apple at (7,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: dots except for an apple at (6,1).\n\nRow 0: dots except for my snake at (4,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (4,0), which is in the bottom row, and there are apples scattered around the board. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying by hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple. I'm at (4,0), and the apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (2,5): |4-2| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |4-2| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- (7,4): |4-7| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,8): |4-6| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,1) with a distance of 3. Then, (2,5) and (7,4) are both at distance 7, and (2,7) and (6,8) are farther away.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet's think about moving towards (6,1). From (4,0), I need to increase X to 6 and increase Y to 1.\n\nSo, I need to move right twice and up once.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFirst, moving right to (5,0):\n\nIs (5,0) occupied? Doesn't seem like it, based on the board.\n\nThen, moving right again to (6,0):\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, moving up to (6,1), where the apple is.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), and it's possible it might move towards me or the apple.\n\nHowever, since I'm moving to (6,1), which is not near the enemy's current position, maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the next apple to go for after picking up (6,1).\n\nAfter picking up (6,1), I would have grown, so my tail will be at (4,0), then (5,0), then (6,0), and my head at (6,1).\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's look at the next closest apple.\n\nThe next closest would likely be (2,5) or (7,4), both at distance 7 from my current position.\n\nBut, after moving to (6,1), my new position is (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (6,1) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5): |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |6-2| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (7,4): |6-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (6,8): |6-6| + |1-8| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,1) is (7,4) at distance 4.\n\nThen, (6,8) at 7, (2,5) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (7,4) next.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (7,4):\n\nNeed to move right to (7,1), then up to (7,4).\n\nThat's one right and three ups.\n\nBut, again, I need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving right to (7,1):\n\nIs (7,1) occupied? Doesn't seem like it.\n\nThen, up to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n(7,4) is where the apple is.\n\nBut, the enemy snake is at (7,6), which is two steps up from (7,4).\n\nSo, after I pick up (7,4), the enemy might be at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, consider that after picking up (7,4), my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\n2. Then, move to (7,1), then (7,2), (7,3), and (7,4) to pick up the next apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider going for (2,5) instead of (7,4) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5):\n\nNeed to move left four times to (2,1), then up four times to (2,5).\n\nThat's a total of eight moves, which is more than going to (7,4), which is only four moves.\n\nSo, (7,4) is still closer.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (7,6), maybe it's safer to go for (2,5).\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6). If I go to (7,4), I'm moving closer to the enemy, which might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (2,5), I'm moving away from the enemy, which might be safer.\n\nBut, it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8):\n\nJust need to move up seven times to (6,8).\n\nThat seems straightforward, but it's a long path upwards.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8), columns 6, rows 1 to 8.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: apple at (6,1)\n\nRow 2: empty\n\nRow 3: empty\n\nRow 4: apple at (7,4), but X is 7, so adjacent but not on the same column.\n\nRow 5: apple at (2,5), but X is 2, so not in column 6.\n\nRow 6: enemy at (7,6), not in column 6.\n\nRow 7: empty\n\nRow 8: apple at (6,8)\n\nSo, column 6 from row 1 to row 8 seems clear except for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTherefore, moving up from (6,1) to (6,8) should be straightforward, picking up the apple at (6,8).\n\nBut, that's a long path, and I need to consider if the enemy might interfere.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6), which is in row 6, column 7.\n\nIf I'm at (6,6), which is directly left of the enemy, that might be dangerous.\n\nBut, I need to pass through (6,6) on my way up from (6,1) to (6,8).\n\nSo, I need to see what the enemy might do.\n\nIf the enemy moves left to (6,6), then I would be at (6,6) at the same time if I'm moving up.\n\nSo, that could cause a collision.\n\nTherefore, going straight up to (6,8) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go around the enemy.\n\nWait,"

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself. So, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nFirst, I should look at the closest apple. From my current position (4,1), the apples are at:\n\n- (2,5): that's 2 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 2 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 3 steps right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 2 steps right and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): 2 steps right and 0 steps up.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be at (6,1), only 2 steps to the right.

From there, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (6,1), the apples are:\n\n- (2,5): 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 4 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 0 steps horizontally and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): already there.\n\nSo, the next closest would be (7,4), which is just 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (7,5), which is just above (7,4). So, if I go to (7,4), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (2,5) instead, even though it's farther away.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5), it's 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\nThat's a longer path, but it might be safer to move away from the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, moving up the board could be risky because there are more apples up there, and the enemy might be moving towards them as well.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,5), which is already somewhat up the board.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8), which is directly above (6,1), but that's a long way up, and I'd have to pass through (6,2), (6,3), etc., up to (6,8).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to be in my way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (2,7), which is further left and up, but that's even farther away.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is (6,1), and then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nI should also consider that as I grow longer, I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nSo, for now, I think the best move is to go right to (5,1), then to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\nThen, I can assess the situation again and choose the next apple based on where the enemy is.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll go right to (5,1).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There's an enemy snake at (7,4) with its body at (7,5).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let's visualize it:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . .

So, it's probably moving upwards.\n\nI should try to avoid getting too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,8) next, which is directly above me.\n\nBut that's pretty far up, and I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,4), and its body is at (7,5), so it might be moving upwards.\n\nIf I go upwards, I might bump into it.\n\nMaybe I should consider going left instead.\n\nFrom (6,1), going left to (5,1), then (4,1), and so on to reach (2,1), and then up to (2,5).\n\nBut there's an apple at (2,5), and also at (2,7).\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (9,2), which is to the right.\n\nFrom (6,1), moving right to (7,1), then (8,1), then (9,1), and then up to (9,2).\n\nBut at (9,1), I need to be careful not to hit the wall.\n\nWait, the board goes from 0 to 9, so (9,1) is fine, but moving up to (9,2) is also safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), (9,2), and (0,9). My snake is at (6,1), and I'm snake ID 2. There's an enemy snake at (8,4) with its body at (7,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let's visualize it:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . T 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,1), right next to me, to my right.\n\nWait, actually, the apple at (6,1) is at my current position, but according to the board, it's at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), (9,2), and (0,9). Maybe there's a mismatch here.\n\nLooking back, in the board, there's an 'A' at (6,1), and also at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), (9,2), and (0,9).\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), and there's an apple there. If I move onto it, I'll eat it and grow longer.\n\nBut, I need to plan my path to eat all the apples efficiently while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nLet me list out all the apples and their distances from my current position.\n\nApples:\n\n- (2,5): That's 4 left and 4 up.\n\n- (2,7): 4 left and 6 up.\n\n- (6,8): 0 left and 7 up.\n\n- (9,2): 3 right and 1 up.\n\n- (0,9): 6 left and 8 up.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,2), which is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nBut wait, I'm at (6,1), and the apple at (9,2) is 3 steps right and 1 step up.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (6,1), which I can eat by moving onto it.\n\nWait, but if I'm already at (6,1), do I need to move onto it again to eat it? Maybe I misread.\n\nLooking back, the board shows an 'A' at (6,1), but I'm also at (6,1). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions.\n\nWait, in the initial information, it says:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6, 1)\"\n\nAnd in the board, row 1, column 6 has both 'T 2' and 'A', so perhaps I'm at (6,1) and there's an apple there.\n\nIn that case, if I move onto (6,1), I eat the apple and grow longer.\n\nBut since I'm already there, maybe I need to move to a new position to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that I can eat the apple by moving onto it, even if I'm already there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to move to a new adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nI think the rule is that if I move onto a cell with an apple, I eat it and grow longer.\n\nSo, if I move to (6,1), I eat the apple there.\n\nBut since I'm already at (6,1), maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to a new cell, and if there's an apple there, I eat it.\n\nSo, maybe I need to move to (6,1) from my current position, wherever that is.\n\nWait, the initial position is (6,1), but in the board, it's shown with 'T 2' and 'A', so perhaps I'm sharing the cell with the apple.\n\nIn that case, moving to (6,1) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the movement options.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nEach move will take me to a new cell in that direction.\n\nI need to pick a direction that takes me to a safe cell, preferably one with an apple.\n\nLooking at my current position (6,1), let's see what's around me.\n\n- Up: (6,2)\n\n- Down: (6,0)\n\n- Left: (5,1)\n\n- Right: (7,1)\n\nWait, the board shows row 1, column 6 has 'T 2' and 'A', so (6,1) has both snake and apple.\n\nLooking at adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (6,2) is empty.\n\n- Down: (6,0) is empty.\n\n- Left: (5,1) is empty.\n\n- Right: (7,1) is empty.\n\nSo, I can move in any of these directions.\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), I don't eat an apple, but I move closer to some apples.\n\nIf I move down to (6,0), there's no apple there.\n\nIf I move left to (5,1), no apple.\n\nIf I move right to (7,1), no apple.\n\nBut the apple at (9,2) is reachable by moving right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (2,5) is to the left and up.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the closest one, which seems to be (9,2), 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (2,5), which is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up.\n\nBut (9,2) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\nWait, Manhattan distance to (9,2) is |9-6| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nTo (2,5): |2-6| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nSo, (9,2) is closer with a distance of 4, while (2,5) is distance 8.\n\nTherefore, I should go for (9,2) first.\n\nSo, from (6,1), I can move right to (7,1), then to (8,1), then to (9,1), then up to (9,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (0,9)\n\nNow, from (9,2), the distances are:\n\n- (2,5): |2-9| + |5-2| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-2| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n- (6,8): |6-9| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- (0,9): |0-9| + |9-2| = 9 + 7 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,8) with a distance of 9.\n\nAfter that, (2,5) with 10, then (2,7) with 12, and finally (0,9) with 16.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim for (6,8) next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's position and movement.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,4), with its body at (7,4).\n\nAssuming the enemy is moving upwards, I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nIf I go to (9,2), then the enemy might be at (8,5), (7,6), etc., depending on its movement.\n\nBut I can't be sure about its path.\n\nTo minimize risk, I should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (9,2) is acceptable, as it's to the right and up, while the enemy is at (8,4), moving upwards.\n\nAfter that, going to (6,8) would involve moving left and up, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (2,5) next, which is to the left and up.\n\nBut that's farther away.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating all the apples in a specific order"

There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1). Also, there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (7,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: dots except for an apple at (6,8).\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7).\n\nRow 6: dots except for enemy snake 1 at (7,6).\n\nRow 5: dots except for an apple at (2,5).\n\nRow 4: dots except for an apple at (7,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: dots except for an apple at (6,1).\n\nRow 0: dots except for my snake at (4,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (4,0), which is in the bottom row, and there are apples scattered around the board. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying by hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple. I'm at (4,0), and the apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (2,5): |4-2| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |4-2| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- (7,4): |4-7| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,8): |4-6| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,1) with a distance of 3. Then, (2,5) and (7,4) are both at distance 7, and (2,7) and (6,8) are farther away.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet's think about moving towards (6,1). From (4,0), I need to increase X to 6 and increase Y to 1.\n\nSo, I need to move right twice and up once.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFirst, moving right to (5,0):\n\nIs (5,0) occupied? Doesn't seem like it, based on the board.\n\nThen, moving right again to (6,0):\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, moving up to (6,1), where the apple is.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), and it's possible it might move towards me or the apple.\n\nHowever, since I'm moving to (6,1), which is not near the enemy's current position, maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the next apple to go for after picking up (6,1).\n\nAfter picking up (6,1), I would have grown, so my tail will be at (4,0), then (5,0), then (6,0), and my head at (6,1).\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's look at the next closest apple.\n\nThe next closest would likely be (2,5) or (7,4), both at distance 7 from my current position.\n\nBut, after moving to (6,1), my new position is (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (6,1) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5): |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |6-2| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (7,4): |6-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (6,8): |6-6| + |1-8| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,1) is (7,4) at distance 4.\n\nThen, (6,8) at 7, (2,5) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (7,4) next.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (7,4):\n\nNeed to move right to (7,1), then up to (7,4).\n\nThat's one right and three ups.\n\nBut, again, I need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving right to (7,1):\n\nIs (7,1) occupied? Doesn't seem like it.\n\nThen, up to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n(7,4) is where the apple is.\n\nBut, the enemy snake is at (7,6), which is two steps up from (7,4).\n\nSo, after I pick up (7,4), the enemy might be at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, consider that after picking up (7,4), my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\n2. Then, move to (7,1), then (7,2), (7,3), and (7,4) to pick up the next apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider going for (2,5) instead of (7,4) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5):\n\nNeed to move left four times to (2,1), then up four times to (2,5).\n\nThat's a total of eight moves, which is more than going to (7,4), which is only four moves.\n\nSo, (7,4) is still closer.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (7,6), maybe it's safer to go for (2,5).\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6). If I go to (7,4), I'm moving closer to the enemy, which might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (2,5), I'm moving away from the enemy, which might be safer.\n\nBut, it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8):\n\nJust need to move up seven times to (6,8).\n\nThat seems straightforward, but it's a long path upwards.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8), columns 6, rows 1 to 8.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: apple at (6,1)\n\nRow 2: empty\n\nRow 3: empty\n\nRow 4: apple at (7,4), but X is 7, so adjacent but not on the same column.\n\nRow 5: apple at (2,5), but X is 2, so not in column 6.\n\nRow 6: enemy at (7,6), not in column 6.\n\nRow 7: empty\n\nRow 8: apple at (6,8)\n\nSo, column 6 from row 1 to row 8 seems clear except for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTherefore, moving up from (6,1) to (6,8) should be straightforward, picking up the apple at (6,8).\n\nBut, that's a long path, and I need to consider if the enemy might interfere.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6), which is in row 6, column 7.\n\nIf I'm at (6,6), which is directly left of the enemy, that might be dangerous.\n\nBut, I need to pass through (6,6) on my way up from (6,1) to (6,8).\n\nSo, I need to see what the enemy might do.\n\nIf the enemy moves left to (6,6), then I would be at (6,6) at the same time if I'm moving up.\n\nSo, that could cause a collision.\n\nTherefore, going straight up to (6,8) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go around the enemy.\n\nWait,"

From there, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (6,1), the apples are:\n\n- (2,5): 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 4 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 0 steps horizontally and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): already there.\n\nSo, the next closest would be (7,4), which is just 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (7,5), which is just above (7,4). So, if I go to (7,4), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (2,5) instead, even though it's farther away.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5), it's 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\nThat's a longer path, but it might be safer to move away from the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, moving up the board could be risky because there are more apples up there, and the enemy might be moving towards them as well.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,5), which is already somewhat up the board.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8), which is directly above (6,1), but that's a long way up, and I'd have to pass through (6,2), (6,3), etc., up to (6,8).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to be in my way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (2,7), which is further left and up, but that's even farther away.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is (6,1), and then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nI should also consider that as I grow longer, I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nSo, for now, I think the best move is to go right to (5,1), then to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\nThen, I can assess the situation again and choose the next apple based on where the enemy is.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll go right to (5,1).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

Maybe I need to consider that I can eat the apple by moving onto it, even if I'm already there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to move to a new adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nI think the rule is that if I move onto a cell with an apple, I eat it and grow longer.\n\nSo, if I move to (6,1), I eat the apple there.\n\nBut since I'm already at (6,1), maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to (6,1) from my current position, wherever that is.\n\nWait, the initial position is (6,1), but in the board, it's shown with 'T 2' and 'A', so (6,1) has both snake and apple.\n\nIn that case, moving to (6,1) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the movement options.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nEach move will take me to a new cell in that direction.\n\nI need to pick a direction that takes me to a safe cell, preferably one with an apple.\n\nLooking at my current position (6,1), let's see what's around me.\n\n- Up: (6,2)\n\n- Down: (6,0)\n\n- Left: (5,1)\n\n- Right: (7,1)\n\nWait, the board shows row 1, column 6 has 'T 2' and 'A', so (6,1) has both snake and apple.\n\nLooking at adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (6,2) is empty.\n\n- Down: (6,0) is empty.\n\n- Left: (5,1) is empty.\n\n- Right: (7,1) is empty.\n\nSo, I can move in any of these directions.\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), I don't eat an apple, but I move closer to some apples.\n\nIf I move down to (6,0), there's no apple there.\n\nIf I move left to (5,1), no apple.\n\nIf I move right to (7,1), no apple.\n\nBut the apple at (9,2) is reachable by moving right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (2,5) is to the left and up.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the closest one, which seems to be (9,2), 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (2,5), which is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up.\n\nBut (9,2) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\nWait, Manhattan distance to (9,2) is |9-6| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nTo (2,5): |2-6| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nSo, (9,2) is closer with a distance of 4, while (2,5) is distance 8.\n\nTherefore, I should go for (9,2) first.\n\nSo, from (6,1), I can move right to (7,1), then to (8,1), then to (9,1), then up to (9,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (0,9)\n\nNow, from (9,2), the distances are:\n\n- (2,5): |2-9| + |5-2| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-2| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n- (6,8): |6-9| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- (0,9): |0-9| + |9-2| = 9 + 7 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,8) with a distance of 9.\n\nAfter that, (2,5) with 10, then (2,7) with 12, and finally (0,9) with 16.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim for (6,8) next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's position and movement.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,4), with its body at (7,4).\n\nAssuming the enemy is moving upwards, I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nIf I go to (9,2), then the enemy might be at (8,5), (7,6), etc., depending on its movement.\n\nBut I can't be sure about its path.\n\nTo minimize risk, I should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (9,2) is acceptable, as it's to the right and up, while the enemy is at (8,4), moving upwards.\n\nAfter that, going to (6,8) would involve moving left and up, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (2,5) next, which is to the left and up.\n\nBut that's farther away.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating all the apples in a specific order to minimize total movement.\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nFirst, go to (9,2), then to (6,8), then to (2,5), then to (2,7), and finally to (0,9).\n\nThis seems logical based on the distances.\n\nNow, for the first move, I need to go to (9,2).\n\nFrom (6,1), I need to move right to (7"

There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1). Also, there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (7,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: dots except for an apple at (6,8).\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7).\n\nRow 6: dots except for enemy snake 1 at (7,6).\n\nRow 5: dots except for an apple at (2,5).\n\nRow 4: dots except for an apple at (7,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: dots except for an apple at (6,1).\n\nRow 0: dots except for my snake at (4,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (4,0), which is in the bottom row, and there are apples scattered around the board. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying by hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple. I'm at (4,0), and the apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (2,5): |4-2| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |4-2| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- (7,4): |4-7| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,8): |4-6| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,1) with a distance of 3. Then, (2,5) and (7,4) are both at distance 7, and (2,7) and (6,8) are farther away.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet's think about moving towards (6,1). From (4,0), I need to increase X to 6 and increase Y to 1.\n\nSo, I need to move right twice and up once.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFirst, moving right to (5,0):\n\nIs (5,0) occupied? Doesn't seem like it, based on the board.\n\nThen, moving right again to (6,0):\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, moving up to (6,1), where the apple is.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), and it's possible it might move towards me or the apple.\n\nHowever, since I'm moving to (6,1), which is not near the enemy's current position, maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the next apple to go for after picking up (6,1).\n\nAfter picking up (6,1), I would have grown, so my tail will be at (4,0), then (5,0), then (6,0), and my head at (6,1).\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's look at the next closest apple.\n\nThe next closest would likely be (2,5) or (7,4), both at distance 7 from my current position.\n\nBut, after moving to (6,1), my new position is (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (6,1) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5): |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |6-2| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (7,4): |6-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (6,8): |6-6| + |1-8| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,1) is (7,4) at distance 4.\n\nThen, (6,8) at 7, (2,5) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (7,4) next.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (7,4):\n\nNeed to move right to (7,1), then up to (7,4).\n\nThat's one right and three ups.\n\nBut, again, I need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving right to (7,1):\n\nIs (7,1) occupied? Doesn't seem like it.\n\nThen, up to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n(7,4) is where the apple is.\n\nBut, the enemy snake is at (7,6), which is two steps up from (7,4).\n\nSo, after I pick up (7,4), the enemy might be at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, consider that after picking up (7,4), my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\n2. Then, move to (7,1), then (7,2), (7,3), and (7,4) to pick up the next apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider going for (2,5) instead of (7,4) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5):\n\nNeed to move left four times to (2,1), then up four times to (2,5).\n\nThat's a total of eight moves, which is more than going to (7,4), which is only four moves.\n\nSo, (7,4) is still closer.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (7,6), maybe it's safer to go for (2,5).\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6). If I go to (7,4), I'm moving closer to the enemy, which might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (2,5), I'm moving away from the enemy, which might be safer.\n\nBut, it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8):\n\nJust need to move up seven times to (6,8).\n\nThat seems straightforward, but it's a long path upwards.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8), columns 6, rows 1 to 8.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: apple at (6,1)\n\nRow 2: empty\n\nRow 3: empty\n\nRow 4: apple at (7,4), but X is 7, so adjacent but not on the same column.\n\nRow 5: apple at (2,5), but X is 2, so not in column 6.\n\nRow 6: enemy at (7,6), not in column 6.\n\nRow 7: empty\n\nRow 8: apple at (6,8)\n\nSo, column 6 from row 1 to row 8 seems clear except for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTherefore, moving up from (6,1) to (6,8) should be straightforward, picking up the apple at (6,8).\n\nBut, that's a long path, and I need to consider if the enemy might interfere.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6), which is in row 6, column 7.\n\nIf I'm at (6,6), which is directly left of the enemy, that might be dangerous.\n\nBut, I need to pass through (6,6) on my way up from (6,1) to (6,8).\n\nSo, I need to see what the enemy might do.\n\nIf the enemy moves left to (6,6), then I would be at (6,6) at the same time if I'm moving up.\n\nSo, that could cause a collision.\n\nTherefore, going straight up to (6,8) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go around the enemy.\n\nWait,"

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself. So, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nFirst, I should look at the closest apple. From my current position (4,1), the apples are at:\n\n- (2,5): that's 2 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 2 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 3 steps right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 2 steps right and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): 2 steps right and 0 steps up.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be at (6,1), only 2 steps to the right.

From there, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (6,1), the apples are:\n\n- (2,5): 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 4 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 0 steps horizontally and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): already there.\n\nSo, the next closest would be (7,4), which is just 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (7,5), which is just above (7,4). So, if I go to (7,4), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (2,5) instead, even though it's farther away.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5), it's 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\nThat's a longer path, but it might be safer to move away from the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, moving up the board could be risky because there are more apples up there, and the enemy might be moving towards them as well.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,5), which is already somewhat up the board.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8), which is directly above (6,1), but that's a long way up, and I'd have to pass through (6,2), (6,3), etc., up to (6,8).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to be in my way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (2,7), which is further left and up, but that's even farther away.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is (6,1), and then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nI should also consider that as I grow longer, I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nSo, for now, I think the best move is to go right to (5,1), then to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\nThen, I can assess the situation again and choose the next apple based on where the enemy is.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll go right to (5,1).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There's an enemy snake at (7,4) with its body at (7,5).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let's visualize it:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . .

So, it's probably moving upwards.\n\nI should try to avoid getting too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,8) next, which is directly above me.\n\nBut that's pretty far up, and I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,4), and its body is at (7,5), so it might be moving upwards.\n\nIf I go upwards, I might bump into it.\n\nMaybe I should consider going left instead.\n\nFrom (6,1), going left to (5,1), then (4,1), and so on to reach (2,1), and then up to (2,5).\n\nBut there's an apple at (2,5), and also at (2,7).\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (9,2), which is to the right.\n\nFrom (6,1), moving right to (7,1), then (8,1), then (9,1), and then up to (9,2).\n\nBut at (9,1), I need to be careful not to hit the wall.\n\nWait, the board goes from 0 to 9, so (9,1) is fine, but moving up to (9,2) is also safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

Move right to (9,2)\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the remaining apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), and (0,9).\n\nFrom (9,2), the closest apple is (6,8), which is 3 left and 6 up.\n\nAlternatively, (2,5) is 7 left and 3 up.\n\nGiven that (6,8) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3 + 6 = 9) compared to (2,5) which is 7 + 3 = 10, I might prefer going to (6,8) next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and movement.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,5), and its body is at (8,5).\n\nIf the enemy is moving upwards, it might be heading towards (9,6), (9,7), etc.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't collide with it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (6,8) after (9,2), I would need to move left and up, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for (2,5) after (9,2), even though it's a bit farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because (2,5) is closer to the enemy's current position.\n\nWait, no, (2,5) is on the left side of the board, while the enemy is at (9,5), which is on the right side.\n\nSo, moving to (2,5) would actually take me away from the enemy.\n\nTherefore, after eating (9,2), going to (2,5) might be a safer choice.\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nFrom (9,2), moving left to (8,2), then (7,2), then (6,2), then (5,2), then (4,2), then (3,2), then (2,2), then up to (2,3), then (2,4), then (2,5).\n\nThat's a long path, increasing the risk of the enemy moving towards that area.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), I could go for (6,8), which is closer.\n\nFrom (9,2), moving left to (8,2), then (7,2), then (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8).\n\nThat's also a series of moves, but shorter than going to (2,5).\n\nI need to balance between minimizing the distance and avoiding the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (6,8) is better.\n\nAfter eating (6,8), the next apple could be (2,5), then (2,7), and finally (0,9).\n\nAlternatively, after (6,8), go to (2,7), then (2,5), then (0,9).\n\nBut I need to assess the distances and the enemy's potential movement.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for one move.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on the immediate step: moving to (9,2).\n\nOnce I reach (9,2), I can reassess the situation based on the enemy's position at that time.\n\nSo, for now, my priority is to move to (9,2) and eat that apple.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then to (9,2).\n\nLooking at the possible moves:\n\n- Right to (8,2)\n\n- Then right again to (9,2)\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,5), and its body is at (8,5).\n\nIf the enemy moves down to (9,4), then (9,3), and so on, it might intercept my path to (9,2).\n\nBut if I move quickly, I might reach (9,2) before the enemy gets there.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves upwards, I'm safer.\n\nBut I can't predict the enemy's movement, so I need to assume the worst-case scenario.\n\nIn the worst case, the enemy moves down towards (9,2), trying to eat the apple or block my path.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider going for (2,5) directly from (7,2).\n\nThat would require moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), then up to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nThat's a longer path, but it takes me away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, it also means I have to traverse a longer distance, which increases the game time and gives more opportunities for the enemy to interfere.\n\nAlternatively, going for (9,2) is quicker, but riskier.\n\nPerhaps a compromise is to go for (6,8) after (9,2), as it's relatively central and not too close to the enemy.\n\nBut again, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to prioritize eating as many apples as possible as quickly as possible, while avoiding the enemy.\n\nIn this scenario, going for the closest apple, (9,2), makes the most sense.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nNext turn, I can continue moving right to (9,2), eat the apple, and then decide on the next apple based on the enemy's position at that time.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movement and adjust my path accordingly.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is:\n\n1. Move to the closest apple, (9,2).\n\n2. Eat the apple.\n\n3. Assess the enemy's position and move to the next closest apple, prioritizing those farther from the enemy.\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I will move right to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,0). There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1). Also, there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (7,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: dots except for an apple at (6,8).\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7).\n\nRow 6: dots except for enemy snake 1 at (7,6).\n\nRow 5: dots except for an apple at (2,5).\n\nRow 4: dots except for an apple at (7,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: dots except for an apple at (6,1).\n\nRow 0: dots except for my snake at (4,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (4,0), which is in the bottom row, and there are apples scattered around the board. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying by hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple. I'm at (4,0), and the apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (2,5): |4-2| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |4-2| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- (7,4): |4-7| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,8): |4-6| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,1) with a distance of 3. Then, (2,5) and (7,4) are both at distance 7, and (2,7) and (6,8) are farther away.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet's think about moving towards (6,1). From (4,0), I need to increase X to 6 and increase Y to 1.\n\nSo, I need to move right twice and up once.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFirst, moving right to (5,0):\n\nIs (5,0) occupied? Doesn't seem like it, based on the board.\n\nThen, moving right again to (6,0):\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, moving up to (6,1), where the apple is.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), and it's possible it might move towards me or the apple.\n\nHowever, since I'm moving to (6,1), which is not near the enemy's current position, maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the next apple to go for after picking up (6,1).\n\nAfter picking up (6,1), I would have grown, so my tail will be at (4,0), then (5,0), then (6,0), and my head at (6,1).\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's look at the next closest apple.\n\nThe next closest would likely be (2,5) or (7,4), both at distance 7 from my current position.\n\nBut, after moving to (6,1), my new position is (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (6,1) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5): |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |6-2| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (7,4): |6-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (6,8): |6-6| + |1-8| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,1) is (7,4) at distance 4.\n\nThen, (6,8) at 7, (2,5) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (7,4) next.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (7,4):\n\nNeed to move right to (7,1), then up to (7,4).\n\nThat's one right and three ups.\n\nBut, again, I need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving right to (7,1):\n\nIs (7,1) occupied? Doesn't seem like it.\n\nThen, up to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n(7,4) is where the apple is.\n\nBut, the enemy snake is at (7,6), which is two steps up from (7,4).\n\nSo, after I pick up (7,4), the enemy might be at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, consider that after picking up (7,4), my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\n2. Then, move to (7,1), then (7,2), (7,3), and (7,4) to pick up the next apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider going for (2,5) instead of (7,4) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5):\n\nNeed to move left four times to (2,1), then up four times to (2,5).\n\nThat's a total of eight moves, which is more than going to (7,4), which is only four moves.\n\nSo, (7,4) is still closer.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (7,6), maybe it's safer to go for (2,5).\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6). If I go to (7,4), I'm moving closer to the enemy, which might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (2,5), I'm moving away from the enemy, which might be safer.\n\nBut, it's farther away.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8):\n\nJust need to move up seven times to (6,8).\n\nThat seems straightforward, but it's a long path upwards.\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,8), columns 6, rows 1 to 8.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: apple at (6,1)\n\nRow 2: empty\n\nRow 3: empty\n\nRow 4: apple at (7,4), but X is 7, so adjacent but not on the same column.\n\nRow 5: apple at (2,5), but X is 2, so not in column 6.\n\nRow 6: enemy at (7,6), not in column 6.\n\nRow 7: empty\n\nRow 8: apple at (6,8)\n\nSo, column 6 from row 1 to row 8 seems clear except for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTherefore, moving up from (6,1) to (6,8) should be straightforward, picking up the apple at (6,8).\n\nBut, that's a long path, and I need to consider if the enemy might interfere.\n\nEnemy is at (7,6), which is in row 6, column 7.\n\nIf I'm at (6,6), which is directly left of the enemy, that might be dangerous.\n\nBut, I need to pass through (6,6) on my way up from (6,1) to (6,8).\n\nSo, I need to see what the enemy might do.\n\nIf the enemy moves left to (6,6), then I would be at (6,6) at the same time if I'm moving up.\n\nSo, that could cause a collision.\n\nTherefore, going straight up to (6,8) might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go around the enemy.\n\nWait,"

There are apples scattered around the board at positions (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1).

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself. So, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nFirst, I should look at the closest apple. From my current position (4,1), the apples are at:\n\n- (2,5): that's 2 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 2 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 3 steps right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 2 steps right and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): 2 steps right and 0 steps up.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be at (6,1), only 2 steps to the right.

Let's see.\n\nIf I go to (6,1), I'll have grown longer, so I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't lead me into a dead end or into the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake is at (7,5).

From there, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (6,1), the apples are:\n\n- (2,5): 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 4 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 0 steps horizontally and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): already there.\n\nSo, the next closest would be (7,4), which is just 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (7,5), which is just above (7,4). So, if I go to (7,4), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (2,5) instead, even though it's farther away.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5), it's 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\nThat's a longer path, but it might be safer to move away from the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, moving up the board could be risky because there are more apples up there, and the enemy might be moving towards them as well.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,5), which is already somewhat up the board.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8), which is directly above (6,1), but that's a long way up, and I'd have to pass through (6,2), (6,3), etc., up to (6,8).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to be in my way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (2,7), which is further left and up, but that's even farther away.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is (6,1), and then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nI should also consider that as I grow longer, I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nSo, for now, I think the best move is to go right to (5,1), then to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\nThen, I can assess the situation again and choose the next apple based on where the enemy is.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll go right to (5,1).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

So, it's probably moving upwards.\n\nI should try to avoid getting too close to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,8) next, which is directly above me.\n\nBut that's pretty far up, and I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,4), and its body is at (7,5), so it might be moving upwards.\n\nIf I go upwards, I might bump into it.\n\nMaybe I should consider going left instead.\n\nFrom (6,1), going left to (5,1), then (4,1), and so on to reach (2,1), and then up to (2,5).\n\nBut there's an apple at (2,5), and also at (2,7).\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for (9,2), which is to the right.\n\nFrom (6,1), moving right to (7,1), then (8,1), then (9,1), and then up to (9,2).\n\nBut at (9,1), I need to be careful not to hit the wall.\n\nWait, the board goes from 0 to 9, so (9,1) is fine, but moving up to (9,2) is also safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move right to (6,1) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Move right to (7,1).\n\n3. Move right to (8,1).\n\n4. Move right to (9,1).\n\n5. Move up to (9,2) to eat the apple.\n\nNow, from (9,2), the next apples are:\n\n- (2,5): 7 left and 3 up.\n\n- (2,7): 7 left and 5 up.\n\n- (6,8): 3 left and 6 up.\n\n- (6,1): already eaten.\n\nSo, the closest is (2,5), which is 7 left and 3 up.\n\nThis seems like a long path. I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (6,8) after (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1), moving up to (6,2), then (6,3), and so on up to (6,8).\n\nBut that's a long way up, and the enemy is already at (7,4), moving upwards.\n\nI might cross paths with the enemy.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just stick with going for the closest apple each time, while avoiding the enemy.\n\nSo, for now, move right to (6,1), then look for the next apple.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (6,1), which is right next to me.\n\nIf I move right to (6,1), I eat it and grow longer.\n\nThen, from (6,1), I can see the apple at (9,2), which is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving into my path.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position, it's at (7,4), and its body is at (7,5), so it might be moving upwards.\n\nIf I move right to (6,1), then right to (7,1), then right to (8,1), then right to (9,1), then up to (9,2), I might be safe.\n\nLet me check the path:\n\n- (5,1) -> (6,1): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- (6,1) -> (7,1): safe, no obstacles.\n\n- (7,1) -> (8,1): safe.\n\n- (8,1) -> (9,1): safe.\n\n- (9,1) -> (9,2): eat apple.\n\nDuring this path, the enemy is at (7,4), moving upwards to (7,5), etc.\n\nSo, as long as I stay below row 4, I should be safe.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,4), and its body is at (7,5), so it's probably moving upwards.\n\nIf I stay below row 4, I shouldn't intersect with it.\n\nSo, this seems a safe path.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I can then aim for another apple.\n\nLet's see, after (9,2), the closest apple is (2,5), which is 7 left and 3 up.\n\nWait, from (9,2), moving left to (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), then up to (2,3), then (2,4), then (2,5) to eat the apple.\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a shorter path.\n\nWait, from (9,2), I could move up to (9,3), then left to (8,3), and so on, but that might not be efficient.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for one move.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on getting the closest apple, which is (6,1), and then assess the situation again.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider that as I grow longer, I have to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (6,1), I eat the apple and grow longer, so my tail will extend.\n\nI need to make sure that the next move doesn't lead me back into my own tail.\n\nBut in this case, moving right to (6,1), then right to (7,1), and so on, should be safe, as I'm moving in a straight line.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movement and adjust my path accordingly.\n\nFor now, I think the best move is to move right to (6,1) and eat the apple.\n\nThen, plan the next moves based on the enemy's position.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**End of Move**"

Let's visualize it based on the given positions:\n\n- Apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), (9,2), and (0,9).\n\n- My snake is at (7,2).\n\n- Enemy snake is at (9,5) with its body at (8,5).\n\nSo, I'm at (7,2), and I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me list out all the apples and their distances from my current position.\n\nApples:\n\n- (2,5): That's 5 left and 3 up.\n\n- (2,7): 5 left and 5 up.\n\n- (6,8): 1 left and 6 up.\n\n- (9,2): 2 right and 0 up.\n\n- (0,9): 7 left and 7 up.\n\nSo, the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (9,2), which is only 2 steps to the right.\n\nBut I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake and plan accordingly.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,5) with its body at (8,5). So, it's somewhat above and to the right of me.\n\nIf I go to (9,2), which is to the right, I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't going to block my path or eat the apple before I do.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go to (9,2)\n\n- Move right to (8,2), then to (9,2).\n\n- This is straightforward, and it's close.\n\n- But I need to check if the enemy is moving towards it.\n\n- The enemy is at (9,5), so if it moves down, it could be a conflict.\n\nOption 2: Go to (2,5)\n\n- This is further away, 5 left and 3 up.\n\n- It would take more moves, increasing the risk of running into the enemy.\n\nOption 3: Go to (6,8)\n\n- 1 left and 6 up.\n\n- Even further, and closer to the enemy's current position.\n\nOption 4: Go to (0,9)\n\n- 7 left and 7 up.\n\n- This is the furthest away.\n\nOption 5: Go to (2,7)\n\n- 5 left and 5 up.\n\n- Still quite a distance.\n\nGiven these options, it seems that going for the closest apple at (9,2) is the best initial move.\n\nLet me plan my path to (9,2):\n\n1. Current position: (7,2)\n\n2. Move right to (8,2)\n\n3. Move right to (9,2)\n\n- Eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the remaining apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), and (0,9).\n\nFrom (9,2), the closest apple is (6,8), which is 3 left and 6 up.\n\nAlternatively, (2,5) is 7 left and 3 up.\n\nGiven that (6,8) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (3 + 6 = 9) compared to (2,5) which is 7 + 3 = 10, I might prefer going to (6,8) next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and movement.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,5), and its body is at (8,5).\n\nIf the enemy is moving upwards, it might be heading towards (9,6), (9,7), etc.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't collide with it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (6,8) after (9,2), I would need to move left and up, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for (2,5) after (9,2), even though it's a bit farther, to get away from the enemy.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because (2,5) is closer to the enemy's current position.\n\nWait, no, (2,5) is on the left side of the board, while the enemy is at (9,5), which is on the right side.\n\nSo, moving to (2,5) would actually take me away from the enemy.\n\nTherefore, after eating (9,2), going to (2,5) might be a safer choice.\n\nBut that would require moving left and up.\n\nFrom (9,2), moving left to (8,2), then (7,2), then (6,2), then (5,2), then (4,2), then (3,2), then (2,2), then up to (2,3), then (2,4), then (2,5).\n\nThat's a long path, increasing the risk of the enemy moving towards that area.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (9,2), I could go for (6,8), which is closer.\n\nFrom (9,2), moving left to (8,2), then (7,2), then (6,2), then up to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8).\n\nThat's also a series of moves, but shorter than going to (2,5).\n\nI need to balance between minimizing the distance and avoiding the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (6,8) is better.\n\nAfter eating (6,8), the next apple could be (2,5), then (2,7), and finally (0,9).\n\nAlternatively, after (6,8), go to (2,7), then (2,5), then (0,9).\n\nBut I need to assess the distances and the enemy's potential movement.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for one move.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on the immediate step: moving to (9,2).\n\nOnce I reach (9,2), I can reassess the situation based on the enemy's position at that time.\n\nSo, for now, my priority is to move to (9,2) and eat that apple.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then to (9,2).\n\nLooking at the possible moves:\n\n- Right to (8,2)\n\n- Then right again to (9,2)\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,5), and its body is at (8,5).\n\nIf the enemy moves down to (9,4), then (9,3), and so on, it might intercept my path to (9,2).\n\nBut if I move quickly, I might reach (9,2) before the enemy gets there.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves upwards, I'm safer.\n\nBut I can't predict the enemy's movement, so I need to assume the worst-case scenario.\n\nIn the worst case, the enemy moves down towards (9,2), trying to eat the apple or block my path.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider going for (2,5) directly from (7,2).\n\nThat would require moving left to (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), then up to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nThat's a longer path, but it takes me away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, it also means I have to traverse a longer distance, which increases the game time and gives more opportunities for the enemy to interfere.\n\nAlternatively, going for (9,2) is quicker, but riskier.\n\nPerhaps a compromise is to go for (6,8) after (9,2), as it's relatively central and not too close to the enemy.\n\nBut again, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to prioritize eating as many apples as possible as quickly as possible, while avoiding the enemy.\n\nIn this scenario, going for the closest apple, (9,2), makes the most sense.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nNext turn, I can continue moving right to (9,2), eat the apple, and then decide on the next apple based on the enemy's position at that time.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movement and adjust my path accordingly.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is:\n\n1. Move to the closest apple, (9,2).\n\n2. Eat the apple.\n\n3. Assess the enemy's position and move to the next closest apple, prioritizing those farther from the enemy.\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I will move right to (8,2).\n\n**Final Move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,0). There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1). Also, there's an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (7,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots, no apples or snakes.\n\nRow 8: dots except for an apple at (6,8).\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7).\n\nRow 6: dots except for enemy snake 1 at (7,6).\n\nRow 5: dots except for an apple at (2,5).\n\nRow 4: dots except for an apple at (7,4).\n\nRow 3: all dots.\n\nRow 2: all dots.\n\nRow 1: dots except for an apple at (6,1).\n\nRow 0: dots except for my snake at (4,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (4,0), which is in the bottom row, and there are apples scattered around the board. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying by hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to pick up as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closest apple. I'm at (4,0), and the apples are at (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (2,5): |4-2| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (2,7): |4-2| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- (7,4): |4-7| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,8): |4-6| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,1) with a distance of 3. Then, (2,5) and (7,4) are both at distance 7, and (2,7) and (6,8) are farther away.\n\nBut, I need to consider the positions of the enemy snake and potential paths.\n\nLet's think about moving towards (6,1). From (4,0), I need to increase X to 6 and increase Y to 1.\n\nSo, I need to move right twice and up once.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nFirst, moving right to (5,0):\n\nIs (5,0) occupied? Doesn't seem like it, based on the board.\n\nThen, moving right again to (6,0):\n\nAgain, seems clear.\n\nThen, moving up to (6,1), where the apple is.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut, I need to consider if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,6), and it's possible it might move towards me or the apple.\n\nHowever, since I'm moving to (6,1), which is not near the enemy's current position, maybe it's safe for now.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the next apple to go for after picking up (6,1).\n\nAfter picking up (6,1), I would have grown, so my tail will be at (4,0), then (5,0), then (6,0), and my head at (6,1).\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's look at the next closest apple.\n\nThe next closest would likely be (2,5) or (7,4), both at distance 7 from my current position.\n\nBut, after moving to (6,1), my new position is (6,1).\n\nLet's calculate distances from (6,1) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5): |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (2,7): |6-2| + |1-7| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (7,4): |6-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (6,8): |6-6| + |1-8| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,1) is (7,4) at distance 4.\n\nThen, (6,8) at 7, (2,5) at 8, and (2,7) at 10.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (7,4) next.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (7,4):\n\nNeed to move right to (7,1), then up to (7,4).\n\nThat's one right and three ups.\n\nBut, again, I need to check for obstacles.\n\nMoving right to (7,1):\n\nIs (7,1) occupied? Doesn't seem like it.\n\nThen, up to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n(7,4) is where the apple is.\n\nBut, the enemy snake is at (7,6), which is two steps up from (7,4).\n\nSo, after I pick up (7,4), the enemy might be at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nI need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nAlso, consider that after picking up (7,4), my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

There are apples scattered around the board at positions (2,5), (2,7), (7,4), (6,8), and (6,1). There's also an enemy snake at (7,5), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nMy main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself. So, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nFirst, I should look at the closest apple. From my current position (4,1), the apples are at:\n\n- (2,5): that's 2 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 2 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 3 steps right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 2 steps right and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): 2 steps right and 0 steps up.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be at (6,1), only 2 steps to the right.

I need to keep an eye on its position and try to avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or lead me closer to more apples.\n\nLet me think about the positions again.\n\nIf I go to (6,1), which is just 2 steps to the right, that seems straightforward. From there, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (6,1), the apples are:\n\n- (2,5): 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\n- (2,7): 4 steps left and 6 steps up.\n\n- (7,4): 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\n- (6,8): 0 steps horizontally and 7 steps up.\n\n- (6,1): already there.\n\nSo, the next closest would be (7,4), which is just 1 step right and 3 steps up.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (7,5), which is just above (7,4). So, if I go to (7,4), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (2,5) instead, even though it's farther away.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (2,5), it's 4 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\nThat's a longer path, but it might be safer to move away from the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, moving up the board could be risky because there are more apples up there, and the enemy might be moving towards them as well.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,5), which is already somewhat up the board.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (6,8), which is directly above (6,1), but that's a long way up, and I'd have to pass through (6,2), (6,3), etc., up to (6,8).\n\nI need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to be in my way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (2,7), which is further left and up, but that's even farther away.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is (6,1), and then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nI should also consider that as I grow longer, I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nSo, for now, I think the best move is to go right to (5,1), then to (6,1) to pick up the apple.\n\nThen, I can assess the situation again and choose the next apple based on where the enemy is.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll go right to (5,1).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

Maybe I misread.\n\nLooking back, the board shows an 'A' at (6,1), but I'm also at (6,1).

Maybe I need to consider that I can eat the apple by moving onto it, even if I'm already there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to move to a new adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nI think the rule is that if I move onto a cell with an apple, I eat it and grow longer.\n\nSo, if I move to (6,1), I eat the apple there.\n\nBut since I'm already at (6,1), maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to a new cell, and if there's an apple there, I eat it.\n\nSo, maybe I need to move to (6,1) from my current position, wherever that is.\n\nWait, the initial position is (6,1), but in the board, it's shown with 'T 2' and 'A', so perhaps I'm sharing the cell with the apple.\n\nIn that case, moving to (6,1) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the movement options.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nEach move will take me to a new cell in that direction.\n\nI need to pick a direction that takes me to a safe cell, preferably one with an apple.\n\nLooking at my current position (6,1), let's see what's around me.\n\n- Up: (6,2)\n\n- Down: (6,0)\n\n- Left: (5,1)\n\n- Right: (7,1)\n\nWait, the board shows row 1, column 6 has 'T 2' and 'A', so (6,1) has both snake and apple.\n\nLooking at adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (6,2) is empty.\n\n- Down: (6,0) is empty.\n\n- Left: (5,1) is empty.\n\n- Right: (7,1) is empty.\n\nSo, I can move in any of these directions.\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), I don't eat an apple, but I move closer to some apples.\n\nIf I move down to (6,0), there's no apple there.\n\nIf I move left to (5,1), no apple.\n\nIf I move right to (7,1), no apple.\n\nBut the apple at (9,2) is reachable by moving right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (2,5) is to the left and up.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the closest one, which seems to be (9,2), 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (2,5), which is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up.\n\nBut (9,2) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\nWait, Manhattan distance to (9,2) is |9-6| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nTo (2,5): |2-6| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nSo, (9,2) is closer with a distance of 4, while (2,5) is distance 8.\n\nTherefore, I should go for (9,2) first.\n\nSo, from (6,1), I can move right to (7,1), then to (8,1), then to (9,1), then up to (9,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (0,9)\n\nNow, from (9,2), the distances are:\n\n- (2,5): |2-9| + |5-2| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-2| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n- (6,8): |6-9| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- (0,9): |0-9| + |9-2| = 9 + 7 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,8) with a distance of 9.\n\nAfter that, (2,5) with 10, then (2,7) with 12, and finally (0,9) with 16.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim for (6,8) next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's position and movement.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,4), with its body at (7,4).\n\nAssuming the enemy is moving upwards, I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nIf I go to (9,2), then the enemy might be at (8,5), (7,6), etc., depending on its movement.\n\nBut I can't be sure about its path.\n\nTo minimize risk, I should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (9,2) is acceptable, as it's to the right and up, while the enemy is at (8,4), moving upwards.\n\nAfter that, going to (6,8) would involve moving left and up, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (2,5) next, which is to the left and up.\n\nBut that's farther away.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating all the apples in a specific order"

My snake is at (6,1), and I'm snake ID 2. There's an enemy snake at (8,4) with its body at (7,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let's visualize it:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . T 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,1), right next to me, to my right.\n\nWait, actually, the apple at (6,1) is at my current position, but according to the board, it's at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), (9,2), and (0,9). Maybe there's a mismatch here.\n\nLooking back, in the board, there's an 'A' at (6,1), and also at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), (9,2), and (0,9).\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), and there's an apple there. If I move onto it, I'll eat it and grow longer.\n\nBut, I need to plan my path to eat all the apples efficiently while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nLet me list out all the apples and their distances from my current position.\n\nApples:\n\n- (2,5): That's 4 left and 4 up.\n\n- (2,7): 4 left and 6 up.\n\n- (6,8): 0 left and 7 up.\n\n- (9,2): 3 right and 1 up.\n\n- (0,9): 6 left and 8 up.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,2), which is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nBut wait, I'm at (6,1), and the apple at (9,2) is 3 steps right and 1 step up.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (6,1), which I can eat by moving onto it.\n\nWait, but if I'm already at (6,1), do I need to move onto it again to eat it? Maybe I misread.\n\nLooking back, the board shows an 'A' at (6,1), but I'm also at (6,1). Maybe I'm sharing the cell with the apple.\n\nIn that case, if I move onto (6,1), I eat the apple and grow longer.\n\nBut since I'm already there, maybe I need to move to a new position to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that I can eat the apple by moving onto it, even if I'm already there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to move to a new adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nI think the rule is that if I move onto a cell with an apple, I eat it and grow longer.\n\nSo, if I move to (6,1), I eat the apple there.\n\nBut since I'm already at (6,1), maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to move to (6,1) from my current position, wherever that is.\n\nWait, the initial position is (6,1), but in the board, it's shown with 'T 2' and 'A', so (6,1) has both snake and apple.\n\nIn that case, moving to (6,1) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to consider the movement options.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nEach move will take me to a new cell in that direction.\n\nI need to pick a direction that takes me to a safe cell, preferably one with an apple.\n\nLooking at my current position (6,1), let's see what's around me.\n\n- Up: (6,2)\n\n- Down: (6,0)\n\n- Left: (5,1)\n\n- Right: (7,1)\n\nWait, the board shows row 1, column 6 has 'T 2' and 'A', so (6,1) has both snake and apple.\n\nLooking at adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (6,2) is empty.\n\n- Down: (6,0) is empty.\n\n- Left: (5,1) is empty.\n\n- Right: (7,1) is empty.\n\nSo, I can move in any of these directions.\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), I don't eat an apple, but I move closer to some apples.\n\nIf I move down to (6,0), there's no apple there.\n\nIf I move left to (5,1), no apple.\n\nIf I move right to (7,1), no apple.\n\nBut the apple at (9,2) is reachable by moving right.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (2,5) is to the left and up.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the closest one, which seems to be (9,2), 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (2,5), which is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up.\n\nBut (9,2) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\nWait, Manhattan distance to (9,2) is |9-6| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nTo (2,5): |2-6| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nSo, (9,2) is closer with a distance of 4, while (2,5) is distance 8.\n\nTherefore, I should go for (9,2) first.\n\nSo, from (6,1), I can move right to (7,1), then to (8,1), then to (9,1), then up to (9,2) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, I can look for the next apple.\n\nAfter eating (9,2), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the remaining apples:\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (0,9)\n\nNow, from (9,2), the distances are:\n\n- (2,5): |2-9| + |5-2| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- (2,7): |2-9| + |7-2| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n- (6,8): |6-9| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- (0,9): |0-9| + |9-2| = 9 + 7 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,8) with a distance of 9.\n\nAfter that, (2,5) with 10, then (2,7) with 12, and finally (0,9) with 16.\n\nSo, perhaps I should aim for (6,8) next.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's position and movement.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,4), with its body at (7,4).\n\nAssuming the enemy is moving upwards, I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nIf I go to (9,2), then the enemy might be at (8,5), (7,6), etc., depending on its movement.\n\nBut I can't be sure about its path.\n\nTo minimize risk, I should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (9,2) is acceptable, as it's to the right and up, while the enemy is at (8,4), moving upwards.\n\nAfter that, going to (6,8) would involve moving left and up, which might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (2,5) next, which is to the left and up.\n\nBut that's farther away.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider eating all the apples in a specific order to minimize total movement.\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nFirst, go to (9,2), then to (6,8), then to (2,5), then to (2,7), and finally to (0,9).\n\nThis seems logical based on the distances.\n\nNow, for the first move, I need to go to (9,2).\n\nFrom (6,1), I need to move right to (7"

My goal is to secure as many apples as possible while avoiding any collisions. If Snake #2 moves towards me, I will need to adjust my path to avoid it. If it stays put or moves away, I will continue towards the apple at (2, 5).\n\nNext move: LEFT."

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see where I am and what's around me.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at top right. There are apples at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), (9,2), and (0,9). My snake is at (9,2), which is position (9,2). Wait, in the board state, it shows my snake's tail at (2,2), body at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), and head at (9,2). So, I'm snake ID 2, and my body occupies (2,2) to (9,2).\n\nEnemy snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 is at position (9,3) with body at (9,4).\n\nSo, enemy snake is just above me at (9,3), and its body is at (9,4).\n\nBoard state:\n\n- Apples at (2,5), (2,7), (6,8), (9,2), and (0,9).\n\nWait, but in the board state, it shows apples at:\n\n- (0,9): A\n\n- (1,1): A\n\n- (2,5): A\n\n- (2,7): A\n\n- (6,8): A\n\nAnd my snake is at (9,2), with body from (2,2) to (9,2).\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,3), body at (9,4).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I need to see what's around my current head position, which is (9,2).\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Right: (9,3) \u2014 enemy snake's head.\n\n- Left: (9,1) \u2014 empty.\n\n- Up: (8,2) \u2014 empty.\n\n- Down: (10,2) \u2014 out of bounds.\n\nWait, coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9), so x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9.\n\nSo, down from (9,2) would be (9,1), not (10,2). Wait, in the coordinate system, increasing y is up, decreasing y is down.\n\nSo, from (9,2):\n\n- Right: (9,3), enemy snake's head.\n\n- Left: (9,1), empty.\n\n- Up: (8,2), empty.\n\n- Down: (9,1), empty.\n\nWait, so left and down are the same position? No, in the coordinate system, left would be decreasing x, but in this board, x increases to the right, y increases upwards.\n\nWait, in the board description, normal X,Y coordinates are used, with (0,0) at bottom left and (9,9) at top right.\n\nSo, increasing x is to the right, increasing y is upwards.\n\nSo, from (9,2):\n\n- Right: (10,2), out of bounds.\n\n- Left: (8,2), empty.\n\n- Up: (9,3), enemy snake's head.\n\n- Down: (9,1), empty.\n\nWait, but earlier it was mentioned that enemy snake is at (9,3), and its body at (9,4).\n\nSo, from my head at (9,2):\n\n- Up: (9,3), enemy snake's head.\n\n- Right: (10,2), out of bounds.\n\n- Down: (9,1), empty.\n\n- Left: (8,2), empty.\n\nSo, I can't go up, as there's the enemy snake's head.\n\nI can't go right, as it's out of bounds.\n\nSo, options are down or left.\n\nBut I need to consider longer moves, not just immediate steps.\n\nLet me think about the board state.\n\nI have apples at:\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (6,8)\n\n- (0,9)\n\n- (1,1)\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many apples as possible without running into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, since I'm at (9,2), and I can't go up or right, I need to choose between down or left.\n\nIf I go down to (9,1), that's empty.\n\nThen, I can continue left or down.\n\nBut down from (9,1) would be (9,0), which is out of bounds.\n\nSo, from (9,1), I can only go left to (8,1), then (7,1), etc.\n\nBut that doesn't lead me to any apple soon.\n\nAlternatively, going left from (9,2) to (8,2), then (7,2), etc.\n\nWait, but my body is already at (8,2), (7,2), etc.\n\nSo, moving left from (9,2) to (8,2), but (8,2) is part of my body, so that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no, in snake games, you can move onto your body, but you can't occupy the same space as your body unless you grow by eating an apple.\n\nBut in this game, if I move to (8,2), which is part of my body, it's allowed as long as the space is not occupied by another snake or myself at the same time.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, moving into your own body causes you to die.\n\nBut in this game, since the body moves simultaneously, if I move head to (8,2), which is occupied by my body, it's illegal.\n\nWait, in most snake games, you can't move into your own body because it's already occupied.\n\nBut in this game, since the body follows the head, it's possible that the body part at (8,2) moves to (7,2), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the entire snake moving.\n\nMy snake is currently:\n\n(2,2) \u2014 tail\n\n(3,2)\n\n(4,2)\n\n(5,2)\n\n(6,2)\n\n(7,2)\n\n(8,2)\n\n(9,2) \u2014 head\n\nIf I move head to (8,2), then the tail moves to (3,2), and the body shifts accordingly.\n\nWait, no, in standard snake, when you move, the tail moves only if you don't eat an apple.\n\nWait, in this game, if you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place.\n\nBut in this turn, there's an apple at (9,2), which is my current head position.\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (9,2), and my head is at (9,2), so if I'm already at (9,2), have I eaten the apple?\n\nWait, no, in snake games, you eat the apple by moving onto it with your head.\n\nSo, if my head is at (9,2), and there's an apple at (9,2), then I've eaten the apple, and my snake grows.\n\nSo, in this turn, I've eaten the apple at (9,2), and my snake has grown.\n\nSo, my snake is now longer.\n\nWait, but in the board state, it shows my snake's tail at (2,2), body at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), head at (9,2), and I've eaten the apple at (9,2), so my snake should have grown by one segment.\n\nSo, my snake is now:\n\n(2,2)\n\n(3,2)\n\n(4,2)\n\n(5,2)\n\n(6,2)\n\n(7,2)\n\n(8,2)\n\n(9,2)\n\n(new segment, since I ate the apple)\n\nBut in the board state, it's shown as T at (4,2), which is my tail, and body segments up to (9,2).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to refer back to the board state provided.\n\nBoard state:\n\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . A . . .\n\n 7 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 5 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n 4 . . . . . . . . . T\n\n 3 . . . . . . . . . 1\n\n 2 . . . . . . . T T 2\n\n 1 .
