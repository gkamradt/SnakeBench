The apples are located at (7, 2), (6, 7), (3, 8), (7, 6), and (5, 1). Moving to (5, 1) would allow me to eat an apple and potentially gain a point. This move would require me to move left, which is an available move.\n\nHowever, moving to (5, 1) would take me away from the other apples, which might not be the most efficient strategy. I should try to move towards multiple apples if possible.\n\nThe apple at (7, 6) is the closest to my current position, but moving to (7, 6) would require me to move right, which is not currently an available move.\n\nThe apple at (6, 7) is also relatively close, but moving to (6, 7) would require me to move up, which is not currently an available move.\n\nThe apples at (7, 2) and (3, 8) are further away, but they are both reachable by moving up and right respectively.\n\nGiven these options, I will move up (to position (0, 3)) to get closer to the apples at (7, 2) and (6, 7). This move also keeps me within reach of the other apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards multiple apples while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nNext move: UP."
