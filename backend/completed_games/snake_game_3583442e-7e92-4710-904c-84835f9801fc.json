The main goal is to gain points by eating apples while avoiding collisions with other snakes, walls, or your own body.\n\nThreats:\n1. Snake #1 is close by at (5, 0).\n2. The board edges (outside the 10x10 area) are walls.\n\nOpportunities:\n1. There are multiple apples available: (4, 7), (7, 7), (0, 1), (6, 1), and (7, 2).\n2. Snake #1 is not directly in our path at the moment.\n\nStrategy:\n1. Move towards an apple to gain points.\n2. Avoid collisions with Snake #1 and the board edges.\n3. Try to create some distance from Snake #1.\n\nNext move:\nSince we are currently at (6, 0), let's move towards the apple at (7, 2) to avoid collisions with Snake #1 and the board edges. This will also create some distance from Snake #1.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
