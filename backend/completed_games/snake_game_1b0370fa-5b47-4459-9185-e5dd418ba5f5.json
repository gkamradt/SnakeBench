            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm controlling snake number 1 in this 10x10 grid. My current position is at (1,1), which is near the bottom left corner. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, looking at the apples. There are apples at positions (1,5), (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), and (8,2). My snake is at (1,1), so the closest apple seems to be (1,0), which is directly below me. Another apple is at (1,5), which is straight up five units. There's also an apple at (8,2), which is further to the right and a bit up.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake number 2 is at (7,0) with an empty body. So I need to be careful not to run into it. Snake 2 is on the right side of the board, at x=7, y=0, which is towards the bottom right. Since its body is empty, it's probably just a head, so it can't block much, but I should still avoid moving towards it unless necessary.\n\nLooking at the current position of my snake, (1,1), the immediate surroundings are mostly empty except for the apple at (1,0) and the enemy at (7,0). The closest walls are at x=0 (left) and y=0 (bottom). Since I'm at y=1, moving down would take me to y=0, which is a wall. Moving left would take me to x=0, also a wall. So I can't go down or left because that would make me hit the wall and die. That leaves me with moving up or right.\n\nMoving up from (1,1) would take me to (1,2), which is safe. Moving right would take me to (2,1), also safe. Now, considering the apples, the one at (1,0) is directly below me, but I can't go down because that's a wall. So maybe I should move up towards (1,5) or go right to get to the apple at (8,2). \n\nWait, but the apple at (1,0) is actually at y=0, which is the same row as the enemy snake's head at (7,0). So if I try to go for (1,0), I can't because moving down is towards the wall. So perhaps that apple is not accessible unless I can move around, but given my current position, I have to go up or right.\n\nIf I move up to (1,2), I can start heading towards (1,5). That's five steps upward. Alternatively, moving right to (2,1) would start me towards the apple at (8,2), which is six units to the right and one up. Let me calculate which path is safer.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,0), so if I move towards (8,2), I might come closer to it, but it's at y=0, so moving towards y=2 would be safe as long as I don't cross its path. But I don't know where snake 2 is moving, so maybe it's safer to go for the apple at (1,5) first since it's in a straight line away from the enemy.\n\nSo, moving up from (1,1) to (1,2), then to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That would take four moves. But I need to check if any other snakes are in that path. From the given positions, there are no other snakes except snake 2, which is at (7,0), so the path up along x=1 seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (8,2) would require moving through x=2 to x=8, which is a lot of steps, but I don't know if snake 2 is moving towards that area. Since snake 2 is at (7,0), maybe it's heading up, but without knowing its direction, it's a bit risky.\n\nSo, I think the safest move right now is to go up towards (1,5). That way, I can collect that apple without encountering the enemy snake. Plus, moving up keeps me away from the enemy's position.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be UP to (1,2), and I should plan to continue moving up in the following turns to reach (1,5).\n</think>\n\nMy next move is UP to get closer to the apple at (1,5). I'll continue moving up in subsequent turns to collect that apple. \n\nNext move: UP"

Enemy snake number 2 is at (7,0). My last move was UP, which seems to be heading towards (1,2). \n\nI need to figure out my next move. Let me visualize the board.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by assessing my current situation. My snake is at position (1,3), and I have several apples nearby. The apples are located at (1,5), (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), and (8,2). Enemy snake #2 is at (7,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head right now.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. My last move was UP, so I moved from (1,2) to (1,3). Now, I should decide where to go next. The closest apple to me is at (1,5), which is two units above my current position. That seems like a good target because it's along the same column, so moving up twice will get me there.\n\nI also need to consider the position of the enemy snake. It's at (7,2), which is quite far from me, so it's not an immediate threat unless it starts moving towards the same apple I'm targeting. However, since the path to (1,5) is clear, I don't need to change my direction to avoid the enemy right now.\n\nLooking at the other apples, (1,0) is below me, but moving down would take me to the edge of the board. I should avoid that because it could lead me to hit the wall, which would cause me to die. So, moving up towards (1,5) is the safest option.\n\nI should also think about growing my snake to gain more points and potentially block the enemy. By moving up and eating the apple at (1,5), I'll grow longer, which can prevent the enemy from reaching me easily. Plus, gaining points is essential to winning the game.\n\nSo, my plan is to continue moving up to reach (1,5). The next move should be UP to (1,4), and then again UP to (1,5) in the following turn. This way, I'll collect the apple, grow, and maintain a safe distance from the enemy.\n\nI don't see any immediate obstacles except for possible future moves of the enemy snake. But since it's far away, I can focus on getting the apple first. After that, I can reassess the board to see where the enemy is heading and plan accordingly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the wall boundaries. Since I'm in column 1, moving left would take me to (0,3), which is a safe move, but moving right to (2,3) is also possible without hitting a wall. However, my primary goal is to reach the apple, so moving up is still the best choice.\n\nI should also check if there are any other apples that might be closer. The apple at (8,2) is far on the right side, and moving there would require crossing the board, which could take several moves and might bring me closer to the enemy. It's better to get the apple that's already in my path.\n\nIn summary, moving UP towards (1,4) is the optimal next step to reach the apple at (1,5), avoid hitting walls, and stay away from the enemy snake. This approach ensures I grow my snake, gain a point, and maintain a strategic position on the board.\n\nNow, let's make the move.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm controlling snake number 1 in this 10x10 grid. My current position is at (1,1), which is near the bottom left corner. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, looking at the apples. There are apples at positions (1,5), (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), and (8,2). My snake is at (1,1), so the closest apple seems to be (1,0), which is directly below me. Another apple is at (1,5), which is straight up five units. There's also an apple at (8,2), which is further to the right and a bit up.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake number 2 is at (7,0) with an empty body. So I need to be careful not to run into it. Snake 2 is on the right side of the board, at x=7, y=0, which is towards the bottom right. Since its body is empty, it's probably just a head, so it can't block much, but I should still avoid moving towards it unless necessary.\n\nLooking at the current position of my snake, (1,1), the immediate surroundings are mostly empty except for the apple at (1,0) and the enemy at (7,0). The closest walls are at x=0 (left) and y=0 (bottom). Since I'm at y=1, moving down would take me to y=0, which is a wall. Moving left would take me to x=0, also a wall. So I can't go down or left because that would make me hit the wall and die. That leaves me with moving up or right.\n\nMoving up from (1,1) would take me to (1,2), which is safe. Moving right would take me to (2,1), also safe. Now, considering the apples, the one at (1,0) is directly below me, but I can't go down because that's a wall. So maybe I should move up towards (1,5) or go right to get to the apple at (8,2). \n\nWait, but the apple at (1,0) is actually at y=0, which is the same row as the enemy snake's head at (7,0). So if I try to go for (1,0), I can't because moving down is towards the wall. So perhaps that apple is not accessible unless I can move around, but given my current position, I have to go up or right.\n\nIf I move up to (1,2), I can start heading towards (1,5). That's five steps upward. Alternatively, moving right to (2,1) would start me towards the apple at (8,2), which is six units to the right and one up. Let me calculate which path is safer.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,0), so if I move towards (8,2), I might come closer to it, but it's at y=0, so moving towards y=2 would be safe as long as I don't cross its path. But I don't know where snake 2 is moving, so maybe it's safer to go for the apple at (1,5) first since it's in a straight line away from the enemy.\n\nSo, moving up from (1,1) to (1,2), then to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That would take four moves. But I need to check if any other snakes are in that path. From the given positions, there are no other snakes except snake 2, which is at (7,0), so the path up along x=1 seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (8,2) would require moving through x=2 to x=8, which is a lot of steps, but I don't know if snake 2 is moving towards that area. Since snake 2 is at (7,0), maybe it's heading up, but without knowing its direction, it's a bit risky.\n\nSo, I think the safest move right now is to go up towards (1,5). That way, I can collect that apple without encountering the enemy snake. Plus, moving up keeps me away from the enemy's position.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be UP to (1,2), and I should plan to continue moving up in the following turns to reach (1,5).\n</think>\n\nMy next move is UP to get closer to the apple at (1,5). I'll continue moving up in subsequent turns to collect that apple. \n\nNext move: UP"

I also see that there are apples at (1, 5) and (7, 6) that are relatively close to me.\n\nConsidering my current position and the board state, I think my best move would be to head towards the apple at (7, 6). It's closer to me than the other apples, and it would give me a chance to grow and gain a point.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on Snake #1's movement and be prepared to adjust my path if necessary.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

Moving up will take me to (1,4) next, and then to (1,5) the turn after that. \n\nI should check if moving in another direction makes sense. The apple at (1,0) is below me, but moving down to get it might not be the best idea because I could end up hitting the wall at (1,0) if I'm not careful. Plus, that's taking me away from the enemy, but it's also a longer path. The other apples are too far away, so focusing on (1,5) is better.\n\nI also need to consider the enemy snake at (7,2).

But since the path to (1,5) is clear, I don't think I need to change my direction to avoid the enemy right now.\n\nMoving up towards (1,5) will help me grow my snake, which is important because it not only gives me points but also makes my snake longer, potentially blocking the enemy in the future. Plus, by moving up, I stay in the same column, which might limit the enemy's movement options if they decide to come towards me.\n\nI should also make sure I'm not going to hit the wall. Since I'm at (1,3), moving up won't take me out of the board because the y-coordinate goes up to 9. So moving up is safe.\n\nAnother thing to think about is that after I eat the apple at (1,5), I might want to consider where to go next. But I'll cross that bridge when I get there. For now, focusing on getting to (1,5) is the priority.\n\nI wonder if the enemy snake will try to come towards me. If I move up, the enemy would have to cross a lot of the board to reach me, which might not be worth their effort. Plus, if I grow longer, I might even be able to block their path or make it harder for them to maneuver.\n\nSo, putting it all together, moving up to (1,4) is the best next step. It gets me closer to the apple, keeps me safe, and doesn't put me in immediate danger from the enemy. I'll make that move and then reassess my position in the next turn.\n\nI should also remind myself to check the enemy's position in the next move to see if they're moving towards me or another apple. That way, I can adjust my strategy if needed. For now, though, I'm confident moving up is the right choice.\n</think>\n\nUP"

The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, looking at the apples. There are apples at positions (1,5), (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), and (8,2). My snake is at (1,1), so the closest apple seems to be (1,0), which is directly below me.

The closest walls are at x=0 (left) and y=0 (bottom). Since I'm at y=1, moving down would take me to y=0, which is a wall. Moving left would take me to x=0, also a wall. So I can't go down or left because that would make me hit the wall and die. That leaves me with moving up or right.\n\nMoving up from (1,1) would take me to (1,2), which is safe. Moving right would take me to (2,1), also safe. Now, considering the apples, the one at (1,0) is directly below me, but I can't go down because that's a wall. So maybe I should move up towards (1,5) or go right to get to the apple at (8,2). \n\nWait, but the apple at (1,0) is actually at y=0, which is the same row as the enemy snake's head at (7,0).

So perhaps that apple is not accessible unless I can move around, but given my current position, I have to go up or right.\n\nIf I move up to (1,2), I can start heading towards (1,5). That's five steps upward. Alternatively, moving right to (2,1) would start me towards the apple at (8,2), which is six units to the right and one up. Let me calculate which path is safer.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,0), so if I move towards (8,2), I might come closer to it, but it's at y=0, so moving towards y=2 would be safe as long as I don't cross its path. But I don't know where snake 2 is moving, so maybe it's safer to go for the apple at (1,5) first since it's in a straight line away from the enemy.\n\nSo, moving up from (1,1) to (1,2), then to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That would take four moves. But I need to check if any other snakes are in that path. From the given positions, there are no other snakes except snake 2, which is at (7,0), so the path up along x=1 seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (8,2) would require moving through x=2 to x=8, which is a lot of steps, but I don't know if snake 2 is moving towards that area. Since snake 2 is at (7,0), maybe it's heading up, but without knowing its direction, it's a bit risky.\n\nSo, I think the safest move right now is to go up towards (1,5). That way, I can collect that apple without encountering the enemy snake. Plus, moving up keeps me away from the enemy's position.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be UP to (1,2), and I should plan to continue moving up in the following turns to reach (1,5).\n</think>\n\nMy next move is UP to get closer to the apple at (1,5). I'll continue moving up in subsequent turns to collect that apple. \n\nNext move: UP"

Enemy snake number 2 is at (7,0). My last move was UP, which seems to be heading towards (1,2). \n\nI need to figure out my next move. Let me visualize the board. My snake is at (1,1), and the closest apples are at (1,0) and (1,5). But moving down to (1,0) would take me to the wall, which is not possible because that would make me die. So, the apple at (1,0) is actually not accessible from my current position since I can't move down further.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by assessing my current situation. My snake is at position (1,3), and I have several apples nearby. The apples are located at (1,5), (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), and (8,2). Enemy snake #2 is at (7,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head right now.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. My last move was UP, so I moved from (1,2) to (1,3). Now, I should decide where to go next. The closest apple to me is at (1,5), which is two units above my current position. That seems like a good target because it's along the same column, so moving up twice will get me there.\n\nI also need to consider the position of the enemy snake. It's at (7,2), which is quite far from me, so it's not an immediate threat unless it starts moving towards the same apple I'm targeting. However, since the path to (1,5) is clear, I don't need to change my direction to avoid the enemy right now.\n\nLooking at the other apples, (1,0) is below me, but moving down would take me to the edge of the board. I should avoid that because it could lead me to hit the wall, which would cause me to die. So, moving up towards (1,5) is the safest option.\n\nI should also think about growing my snake to gain more points and potentially block the enemy. By moving up and eating the apple at (1,5), I'll grow longer, which can prevent the enemy from reaching me easily. Plus, gaining points is essential to winning the game.\n\nSo, my plan is to continue moving up to reach (1,5). The next move should be UP to (1,4), and then again UP to (1,5) in the following turn. This way, I'll collect the apple, grow, and maintain a safe distance from the enemy.\n\nI don't see any immediate obstacles except for possible future moves of the enemy snake. But since it's far away, I can focus on getting the apple first. After that, I can reassess the board to see where the enemy is heading and plan accordingly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the wall boundaries. Since I'm in column 1, moving left would take me to (0,3), which is a safe move, but moving right to (2,3) is also possible without hitting a wall. However, my primary goal is to reach the apple, so moving up is still the best choice.\n\nI should also check if there are any other apples that might be closer. The apple at (8,2) is far on the right side, and moving there would require crossing the board, which could take several moves and might bring me closer to the enemy. It's better to get the apple that's already in my path.\n\nIn summary, moving UP towards (1,4) is the optimal next step to reach the apple at (1,5), avoid hitting walls, and stay away from the enemy snake. This approach ensures I grow my snake, gain a point, and maintain a strategic position on the board.\n\nNow, let's make the move.\n</think>\n\nUP"

My snake is at (1,3), and the apples are at (1,5), (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), and (8,2). Enemy snake #2 is at (7,2). \n\nHmm, the closest apple to me is at (1,5). That's two units up from my current position. So if I move up twice, I can reach it. That seems like a good plan because it's a direct path with no obstacles in the way. Moving up will take me to (1,4) next, and then to (1,5) the turn after that. \n\nI should check if moving in another direction makes sense. The apple at (1,0) is below me, but moving down to get it might not be the best idea because I could end up hitting the wall at (1,0) if I'm not careful. Plus, that's taking me away from the enemy, but it's also a longer path. The other apples are too far away, so focusing on (1,5) is better.\n\nI also need to consider the enemy snake at (7,2). It's quite far, so it's not an immediate threat unless it starts moving towards the same apple I'm going for. But since the path to (1,5) is clear, I don't think I need to change my direction to avoid the enemy right now.\n\nMoving up towards (1,5) will help me grow my snake, which is important because it not only gives me points but also makes my snake longer, potentially blocking the enemy in the future. Plus, by moving up, I stay in the same column, which might limit the enemy's movement options if they decide to come towards me.\n\nI should also make sure I'm not going to hit the wall. Since I'm at (1,3), moving up won't take me out of the board because the y-coordinate goes up to 9. So moving up is safe.\n\nAnother thing to think about is that after I eat the apple at (1,5), I might want to consider where to go next. But I'll cross that bridge when I get there. For now, focusing on getting to (1,5) is the priority.\n\nI wonder if the enemy snake will try to come towards me. If I move up, the enemy would have to cross a lot of the board to reach me, which might not be worth their effort. Plus, if I grow longer, I might even be able to block their path or make it harder for them to maneuver.\n\nSo, putting it all together, moving up to (1,4) is the best next step. It gets me closer to the apple, keeps me safe, and doesn't put me in immediate danger from the enemy. I'll make that move and then reassess my position in the next turn.\n\nI should also remind myself to check the enemy's position in the next move to see if they're moving towards me or another apple. That way, I can adjust my strategy if needed. For now, though, I'm confident moving up is the right choice.\n</think>\n\nUP"

            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this snake game. Let me start by looking at where I am and where everything else is on the board. My snake, ID #1, is currently at position (1,5). There are apples located at (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), (8,2), and (8,3). The enemy snake, #2, is at (7,4), but it doesn't have any body segments listed, so maybe it's just a head right now.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which apple is closest to me because growing my snake by eating an apple is a priority. The apples at (1,0) and (1,5) are in the same x-coordinate as my snake, which is 1. The apple at (1,5) is just one unit above me because I'm at (1,5). Wait, no, I'm at (1,5) already? Or is that my position? Let me check the board state again.\n\nLooking back, the board shows that my snake is at (1,5). So, the apple at (1,5) must be right where I am. Does that mean I've already eaten it? Or is that my current position? Wait, in the initial information, it says my snake is at (1,5). So, perhaps the apple at (1,5) is no longer there because I've already eaten it? Or maybe it's a mistake. Let me clarify.\n\nAssuming I'm at (1,5) and there's an apple at (1,5), that might mean I've just eaten it and should look for the next closest apple. Alternatively, maybe the apple was placed there after I moved, but I'm not sure. To avoid confusion, I'll proceed with the other apples.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), (8,2), and (8,3). The closest one to me would be (1,0), which is in my column but down at the bottom. Alternatively, the apple at (7,6) is diagonally far away, (6,8) is even further, and (8,2) and (8,3) are to the right and down a bit.\n\nSo, (1,0) is in the same column, just below me. My y-coordinate is 5, so moving down to (1,4), (1,3), etc., would take me towards (1,0). But that's five moves down, which seems like a long path. Alternatively, I could look for a closer apple, but all others are in different columns and rows.\n\nWait, I'm at (1,5), and the enemy snake is at (7,4). So, moving towards the right might bring me closer to the enemy. I should be cautious about that. If I move towards (8,2) or (8,3), I might be entering the enemy's vicinity, but it's not clear if that's dangerous yet.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm already at (1,5), maybe I should look to expand my area. Moving left isn't possible because I'm at x=1, the next move left would take me to x=0, which is possible, but there's an apple at (8,2) and (8,3), which are far to the right. So maybe moving right towards x=2,3, etc., could be a way to explore and possibly find a path towards an apple.\n\nWait, but if I move right, I might have more options. Let me think about the board layout. My snake is at (1,5). To the right, columns increase from x=2 to x=9. Moving right into x=2,3,4, etc., might allow me to approach some of the other apples, but they are spread out. The closest apple in that direction would be at (7,6), which is quite a few steps away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up would take me to (1,6), which doesn't have an apple, but moving further up to (1,6), (1,7), etc., might not be helpful since the apples are elsewhere. Moving down towards (1,4), (1,3)... towards (1,0) is an option, but that's a long way and might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. Enemy snake #2 is at (7,4). If I move right towards higher x-values, I might be heading towards the enemy. But I don't know their body segments, so it's hard to tell if that's dangerous. Maybe it's better to avoid that area for now.\n\nAnother thought: since my snake is at (1,5), and there's an apple at (1,0), maybe I can move down towards it. It's five steps down, but if I take that route, I can eat the apple and grow. However, moving down also means I might have less space to maneuver if the enemy approaches, but the enemy is at (7,4), which is far away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should move in a direction that allows me to block the enemy's path or limit their movement. But without knowing their body segments, it's hard to plan that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. My main goal is to collect the nearest apple to grow. The apple at (1,0) is the closest, even though it's five moves away. Alternatively, moving right towards (2,5) might allow me to find a path towards another apple, but it's uncertain.\n\nAnother approach: since I'm at (1,5), maybe I can move up to (1,6), (1,7), etc., but there's no apple there. Alternatively, moving left to (0,5) would take me to the edge, but there's no apple there either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the apples again. The initial list says apples are at (7,6), (6,8), (1,0), (8,2), and (8,3). So, the apple at (1,5) might not be present because I'm positioned there, implying I've eaten it. So the next closest apple is at (1,0).\n\nSo, the plan is to move down towards (1,0). That's five steps down: from (1,5) to (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), and finally (1,0). But that's a long way, and I might not get there before the enemy does something. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple, so I should focus on the closest one.\n\nWait, perhaps I should move up one step to (1,6), but there's no apple there. Or maybe move right to (2,5) to explore more space and possibly find a path to another apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving left to (0,5) isn't useful unless I'm trying to get to an apple there, which there isn't. So moving right seems better. Let's say I move right to (2,5). From there, I can assess the next move. Maybe moving towards (8,2) or (8,3), but that's far.\n\nWait, perhaps the enemy is moving towards the apple at (8,2) or (8,3), given their position at (7,4). If I can get to one of those apples first, I can gain points and maybe trap the enemy.\n\nSo, the strategy could be to move towards (8,2). To get there, I need to go right and down. From (1,5), moving right to (2,5), then (3,5), and so on until x=8, then down to y=2. But that's a long path and might take many moves, during which the enemy could reach it first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,8) is another option, but that's diagonally across the board, which would take even longer.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to move towards the nearest apple, which is (1,0), even though it's five steps away. I can start moving down step by step, each turn moving down, to reach it. Alternatively, I can move in a different direction to chase another apple.\n\nWait, considering that the enemy is at (7,4), maybe moving towards the right and up could get me to (7,6), but that's where an apple is. But moving from (1,5) to (7,6) would require moving right 6 steps and up 1 step, which is a long path. The enemy is at (7,4), so moving to (7,6) might bring me near them, which could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (8,2) or (8,3) might be better, but again, that's a long way.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on moving towards (1,0) since it's in my current column. So, moving down from (1,5) to (1,4), then (1,3), etc., towards (1,0). That way, I can eat the apple and grow, making my snake longer and more formidable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that moving in a straight line towards an apple reduces the risk of colliding with myself, especially if my snake is long. So, moving down the same column is safer in that sense.\n\nBut I'm not sure if there are any obstacles or if the enemy is moving towards the same apple. If the enemy is also moving towards (1,0), it could lead to a collision, but since the enemy is at (7,4), they'd have to move left and down, which is possible but not immediate.\n\nSo, after considering all options, I think moving down towards (1,0) is the best strategy. It's the closest apple, and moving in the same column reduces the risk of collision with myself as I grow.\n\nBut wait, I'm at (1,5). If I move down, each step decreases the y-coordinate. So first move down to (1,4), then (1,3), and so on until (1,0). That's five moves, but maybe I can do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I could move left to (0,5), but there's no apple there, so that doesn't help. Moving right to (2,5) might give me more options in the future, but it's not directly towards an apple.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should move down first towards (1,0). Let's go with that.\n\nSo, my next move will be DOWN, moving to (1,4).\n</think>\n\nDOWN"
