It keeps me away from walls and enemy snakes, which ensures maximum safety.\n\n5. **Future Strategy:**\n   - After eating the apple at (4, 7), I can consider heading towards the apple at (8, 7) or (6, 8). I should keep a watch on the moves of Snake #2 to ensure no collision occurs.\n   - As my snake grows, be careful not to box myself in.\n\nDecided Move: UP"
