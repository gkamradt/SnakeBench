However, I also see that there's an apple at (8, 8) that I can reach by moving down.\n\nMy current position is also quite close to the snake #1, which is at (9, 2). I should try to avoid that snake as much as possible.\n\nConsidering these factors, my next move should be to move down to (8, 6) to get closer to the apple at (8, 8) and to avoid the snake #1.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to move down to (8, 8) and then see how the game unfolds from there.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
