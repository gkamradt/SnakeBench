            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (5,7). The apples are at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6). The enemy snake is at (4,9) with an empty body. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (5,7) are UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), or RIGHT to (6,7). \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5) which is two steps down from me, (2,7) which is three steps left, and (6,6) which is one step right and one down. Wait, (6,6) is actually diagonally down-right from (5,7). So to get there, I need to move right to (6,7) then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which isn't an apple. Hmm. Alternatively, if I go down first to (5,6), then right to (6,6), but that's two moves. But maybe the apple at (6,6) is a good target. \n\nBut there's also the apple at (2,7) which is three steps left. So moving left three times from (5,7) would get me there. But moving left three times would require checking if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away. So the path to (2,7) is clear? Let me check the board state again. The board shows at row 7 (y=7), the snake is at (5,7), and there's an apple at (2,7). So from (5,7) moving left three times would reach (2,7). But each move left would be to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7). Are there any snakes in that path? The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is two rows up. So (4,7) is safe. So that path is clear. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down twice. But moving down once to (5,6) would get me closer. But (5,6) is not an apple. Wait, the apples listed include (5,5), which is two steps down. So moving down twice would get me there. But maybe that's a longer path. \n\nAlso, the apple at (6,6) is one step right and one down. So moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to get the apple. But that's two moves. But maybe that's a good path. \n\nBut I need to choose the next immediate direction. So which direction now gives me the best path towards an apple without danger. Let's check possible dangers. \n\nIf I move UP to (5,8), that's empty. Then next move could be towards an apple. But there's no apple in that direction immediately. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,6), then next move could be down again to (5,5) to get the apple. That's two moves. But moving down now would take me closer. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7), then next left to (3,7), then (2,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. But each step left is safe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next down to (6,6) to get the apple. That's two moves. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Going left towards (2,7) takes three moves but gets an apple. \n- Going down towards (5,5) takes two moves. \n- Going right then down to (6,6) takes two moves. \n\nWhich is the shortest path? The apple at (6,6) is two moves away (right then down), but the apple at (5,5) is two moves down. The apple at (2,7) is three moves left. \n\nBut the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Let's count the steps. From (5,7):\n\nTo (6,6): right then down. Two steps. \n\nTo (5,5): down twice. Two steps. \n\nTo (2,7): left three steps. \n\nSo the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. But (5,5) is directly down, while (6,6) requires right then down. \n\nBut which direction should I choose first? Let's think about possible collisions. \n\nIf I move down now to (5,6), then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. That's safe. But what's at (5,6)? The board shows that row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (6,6). So (5,6) is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) which is an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nBut moving right first: (6,7) is empty. Then next move down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nSo both paths are possible. \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for other snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,9). So their head is at (4,9). They might be moving around, but since their body is empty, they can't block me immediately. \n\nSo both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) would take longer, but maybe that's a less contested apple. \n\nBut since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe going for the closest ones first. \n\nSo between (5,5) and (6,6), which is better? \n\nIf I go down now, I can get to (5,5) in two moves. But moving down now would take me to (5,6), which is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right now to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to get that apple. \n\nWhich path is better? Let's see. \n\nIf I go down now, then next move down again. But after eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow. Then I need to plan the next move. \n\nAlternatively, moving right then down. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (6,6) is in the same row as the enemy snake's position (4,9) is in row 9. So maybe that area is less contested. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (5,5) is closer. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly below me. So moving down twice. \n\nBut maybe the enemy snake could also be heading towards that apple. But since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,6) is near another apple at (5,5). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) could be a longer path, but maybe there's less competition. \n\nBut since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far from (2,7), maybe that's a safer apple. \n\nBut I need to choose the next direction. \n\nSo possible options:\n\n1. Move DOWN towards (5,5). \n\n2. Move RIGHT towards (6,6). \n\n3. Move LEFT towards (2,7). \n\n4. Move UP, but that's away from apples. \n\nMoving UP would take me to (5,8), which is empty. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best choice. \n\nSo between DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT. \n\nWhich is the best first move? \n\nIf I choose DOWN now, then next move is DOWN again. But after that, I'll have to find another apple. \n\nIf I choose RIGHT now, then next move is DOWN to get the apple. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, then next moves are LEFT again. \n\nBut considering the number of steps, the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (6,6) is better because after eating it, I can then move towards other apples. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,5), I can go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nBut (0,5) is to the left, and (9,0) is far to the right and down. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) by moving right and down. \n\nBut maybe the path to (6,6) is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6) and then down to (5,5) gives me an apple. \n\nBut what's the risk? Are there any obstacles in those positions? \n\nThe board shows that (5,6) is empty. (5,5) is an apple. \n\nSo moving down is safe. \n\nSimilarly, moving right to (6,7) is safe. \n\nSo both options are safe. \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the snake grows. So the body will extend. But since the snake's body is only the head right now (since the last move was None, implying it's the start?), then after eating an apple, the body will be longer. \n\nWait, the snake's current position is (5,7). The body is just the head. So moving to an apple will make the body length 2. \n\nSo after eating an apple, the next move will have to avoid running into the body. \n\nBut since the body is just the previous position, which is (5,7) if I move down to (5,6), then the next move can't go back to (5,7). \n\nBut that's standard snake behavior. \n\nSo, perhaps the best first move is to go for the closest apple. \n\nBut which is closer? (5,5) is two steps down, (6,6) is two steps (right then down), (2,7) is three steps left. \n\nSo (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps. \n\nBut (5,5) is directly down, so moving down twice. \n\nAlternatively, (6,6) requires moving right then down. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then proceed towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then maybe go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as my current position. So moving left three times would get me there. But that's three moves. \n\nBut perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe the path is safe. \n\nBut I need to choose the first move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to go for the apple that's in the same row, (2,7). So moving left three times. \n\nBut that's three moves. But maybe after getting that apple, I can go down towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nBut is that the best option? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, (5,7) to (6,6) is one step right and one down. So Manhattan distance is 2. Same as (5,5). \n\nBut the path to (6,6) requires moving right first. \n\nBut moving right now would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6), then down to (5,5). \n\nSo both options are two steps. \n\nBut which path is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, where can I go next. \n\nIf I go to (5,5), then I can move left towards (0,5) or right towards (6,6) again. \n\nIf I go to (6,6), then I can move towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), etc., towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo maybe going for (5,5) first allows me to then go towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) but that's a long path. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is better because it's in a less crowded area. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a central location, making it easier to reach other apples. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest first move is to go down towards (5,5). \n\nBecause moving down now to (5,6) is safe, and then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7) is safe, then down to (6,6). \n\nBut which is better? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer to other apples. For example, after getting (6,6), I can go to (9,0) or (5,5). \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), moving left to (5,6) then down to (5,5). \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) allows me to collect two apples in sequence: (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is to go down. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving down first towards (5,5) is a good choice. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down now to (5,6), then down again to (5,5). \n\nBut after that, the snake's body would be at (5,7) and (5,6), so the next move can't go back up. \n\nBut after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the body would be (5,7) and (5,6), and the new head at (5,5). \n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So when you move into the apple, you add a segment. \n\nSo if the snake is at (5,7), and moves down to (5,6), which is not an apple. Then next move down to (5,5), which is an apple. So after moving into (5,5), the snake's body would be (5,6) and (5,7), and the head at (5,5). So the length is 3. \n\nBut the initial length is 1. So moving to (5,6) (no apple) makes the body length 2. Then moving to (5,5) (apple) makes the body length 3. \n\nSo after eating the apple, the snake's body is (5,6), (5,7), and head at (5,5). \n\nSo the next move after that would have to avoid going back to (5,6). \n\nBut that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, if I go right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) (apple). Then the body would be (5,7), (6,7), and head at (6,6). So length 3. \n\nSo both paths result in the same length. \n\nBut which path allows for more future moves? \n\nAfter getting (5,5), the snake can move left towards (0,5), which is another apple. \n\nBut (0,5) is five steps left from (5,5). \n\nAlternatively, after getting (6,6), the snake can move towards (9,0), which is three steps right and six steps down. \n\nBut that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), the snake can move left to (5,6), then down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nSo maybe going for (6,6) first allows me to collect two apples in sequence. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is more central, allowing access to other apples. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go right first towards (6,6), as that apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) is better because it leads to another apple. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,9). They might be moving towards the apples as well. \n\nThe apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both in the middle of the board. The enemy is at (4,9), which is top-left. So maybe they are closer to (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nBut the enemy's position is (4,9). To get to (5,5), they need to move down four steps and right one. To get to (6,6), they need to move down three steps and right two. \n\nSo maybe the enemy is more likely to go towards (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nIf that's the case, then maybe I should go for (6,6) to avoid competition. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy is moving towards (5,5), then I might want to get there first. \n\nBut since the enemy's body is empty, they are just starting. So their next move could be any direction. \n\nBut without knowing their direction, it's hard to predict. \n\nIn that case, perhaps the safest move is to go for the closest apple that's less likely to be contested. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as me, and the enemy is far away. So moving left three times to get it. \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nBut maybe that's a safer option. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nSo, considering all possibilities, I think the best initial move is to go DOWN towards (5,5). \n\nBecause it's a direct path, and after collecting that apple, I can head towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,7) then down to (6,6) is also good. \n\nBut I need to choose one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is in a position that's easier to reach other apples from. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a more central location, making it easier to navigate to other apples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go RIGHT first. \n\nBecause moving right to (6,7) and then down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nThen, after that, I can move left to (5,6) and down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to go for the apple that's directly below me. \n\nSo, after considering all options, I think moving DOWN is the best first move. \n\nSo the next direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After moving down to (5,6), plan to go down again to (5,5) to eat the apple. Then consider heading left towards (0,5) while avoiding collisions.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

Wait, (6,6) is actually diagonally down-right from (5,7). So to get there, I need to move right to (6,7) then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which isn't an apple. Hmm. Alternatively, if I go down first to (5,6), then right to (6,6), but that's two moves. But maybe the apple at (6,6) is a good target. \n\nBut there's also the apple at (2,7) which is three steps left. So moving left three times from (5,7) would get me there. But moving left three times would require checking if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away. So the path to (2,7) is clear? Let me check the board state again. The board shows at row 7 (y=7), the snake is at (5,7), and there's an apple at (2,7). So from (5,7) moving left three times would reach (2,7). But each move left would be to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7). Are there any snakes in that path? The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is two rows up. So (4,7) is safe. So that path is clear. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down twice. But moving down once to (5,6) would get me closer. But (5,6) is not an apple. Wait, the apples listed include (5,5), which is two steps down. So moving down twice would get me there. But maybe that's a longer path. \n\nAlso, the apple at (6,6) is one step right and one down. So moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to get the apple. But that's two moves. But maybe that's a good path. \n\nBut I need to choose the next immediate direction. So which direction now gives me the best path towards an apple without danger. Let's check possible dangers. \n\nIf I move UP to (5,8), that's empty. Then next move could be towards an apple. But there's no apple in that direction immediately. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,6), then next move could be down again to (5,5) to get the apple. That's two moves. But moving down now would take me closer. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7), then next left to (3,7), then (2,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. But each step left is safe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next down to (6,6) to get the apple. That's two moves. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Going left towards (2,7) takes three moves but gets an apple. \n- Going down towards (5,5) takes two moves. \n- Going right then down to (6,6) takes two moves. \n\nWhich is the shortest path? The apple at (6,6) is two moves away (right then down), but the apple at (5,5) is two moves down. The apple at (2,7) is three moves left. \n\nBut the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Let's count the steps. From (5,7):\n\nTo (6,6): right then down. Two steps. \n\nTo (5,5): down twice. Two steps. \n\nTo (2,7): left three steps. \n\nSo the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. But (5,5) is directly down, while (6,6) requires right then down. \n\nBut which direction should I choose first? Let's think about possible collisions. \n\nIf I move down now to (5,6), then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. That's safe. But what's at (5,6)? The board shows that row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (6,6). So (5,6) is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) which is an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nBut moving right first: (6,7) is empty. Then next move down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nSo both paths are possible. \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for other snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,9). So their head is at (4,9). They might be moving around, but since their body is empty, they can't block me immediately. \n\nSo both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) would take longer, but maybe that's a less contested apple. \n\nBut since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe going for the closest ones first. \n\nSo between (5,5) and (6,6), which is better? \n\nIf I go down now, I can get to (5,5) in two moves. But moving down now would take me to (5,6), which is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right now to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to get that apple. \n\nWhich path is better? Let's see. \n\nIf I go down now, then next move down again. But after eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow. Then I need to plan the next move. \n\nAlternatively, moving right then down. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (6,6) is in the same row as the enemy snake's position (4,9) is in row 9. So maybe that area is less contested. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (5,5) is closer. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly below me. So moving down twice. \n\nBut maybe the enemy snake could also be heading towards that apple. But since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,6) is near another apple at (5,5). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) could be a longer path, but maybe there's less competition. \n\nBut since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far from (2,7), maybe that's a safer apple. \n\nBut I need to choose the next direction. \n\nSo possible options:\n\n1. Move DOWN towards (5,5). \n\n2. Move RIGHT towards (6,6). \n\n3. Move LEFT towards (2,7). \n\n4. Move UP, but that's away from apples. \n\nMoving UP would take me to (5,8), which is empty. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best choice. \n\nSo between DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT. \n\nWhich is the best first move? \n\nIf I choose DOWN now, then next move is DOWN again. But after that, I'll have to find another apple. \n\nIf I choose RIGHT now, then next move is DOWN to get the apple. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, then next moves are LEFT again. \n\nBut considering the number of steps, the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (6,6) is better because after eating it, I can then move towards other apples. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,5), I can go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nBut (0,5) is to the left, and (9,0) is far to the right and down. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) by moving right and down. \n\nBut maybe the path to (6,6) is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6) and then down to (5,5) gives me an apple. \n\nBut what's the risk? Are there any obstacles in those positions? \n\nThe board shows that (5,6) is empty. (5,5) is an apple. \n\nSo moving down is safe. \n\nSimilarly, moving right to (6,7) is safe. \n\nSo both options are safe. \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the snake grows. So the body will extend. But since the snake's body is only the head right now (since the last move was None, implying it's the start?), then after eating an apple, the body will be longer. \n\nWait, the snake's current position is (5,7). The body is just the head. So moving to an apple will make the body length 2. \n\nSo after eating an apple, the next move will have to avoid running into the body. \n\nBut since the body is just the previous position, which is (5,7) if I move down to (5,6), then the next move can't go back to (5,7). \n\nBut that's standard snake behavior. \n\nSo, perhaps the best first move is to go for the closest apple. \n\nBut which is closer? (5,5) is two steps down, (6,6) is two steps (right then down), (2,7) is three steps left. \n\nSo (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps. \n\nBut (5,5) is directly down, so moving down twice. \n\nAlternatively, (6,6) requires moving right then down. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then proceed towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then maybe go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as my current position. So moving left three times would get me there. But that's three moves. \n\nBut perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe the path is safe. \n\nBut I need to choose the first move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to go for the apple that's in the same row, (2,7). So moving left three times. \n\nBut that's three moves. But maybe after getting that apple, I can go down towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nBut is that the best option? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, (5,7) to (6,6) is one step right and one down. So Manhattan distance is 2. Same as (5,5). \n\nBut the path to (6,6) requires moving right first. \n\nBut moving right now would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6), then down to (5,5). \n\nSo both options are two steps. \n\nBut which path is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, where can I go next. \n\nIf I go to (5,5), then I can move left towards (0,5) or right towards (6,6) again. \n\nIf I go to (6,6), then I can move towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), etc., towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo maybe going for (5,5) first allows me to then go towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) but that's a long path. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is better because it's in a less crowded area. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a central location, making it easier to reach other apples. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest first move is to go down towards (5,5). \n\nBecause moving down now to (5,6) is safe, and then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7) is safe, then down to (6,6). \n\nBut which is better? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer to other apples. For example, after getting (6,6), I can go to (9,0) or (5,5). \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), moving left to (5,6) then down to (5,5). \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) allows me to collect two apples in sequence: (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is to go down. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving down first towards (5,5) is a good choice. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down now to (5,6), then down again to (5,5). \n\nBut after that, the snake's body would be at (5,7) and (5,6), so the next move can't go back up. \n\nBut after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the body would be (5,7) and (5,6), and the new head at (5,5). \n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So when you move into the apple, you add a segment. \n\nSo if the snake is at (5,7), and moves down to (5,6), which is not an apple. Then next move down to (5,5), which is an apple. So after moving into (5,5), the snake's body would be (5,6) and (5,7), and the head at (5,5). So the length is 3. \n\nBut the initial length is 1. So moving to (5,6) (no apple) makes the body length 2. Then moving to (5,5) (apple) makes the body length 3. \n\nSo after eating the apple, the snake's body is (5,6), (5,7), and head at (5,5). \n\nSo the next move after that would have to avoid going back to (5,6). \n\nBut that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, if I go right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) (apple). Then the body would be (5,7), (6,7), and head at (6,6). So length 3. \n\nSo both paths result in the same length. \n\nBut which path allows for more future moves? \n\nAfter getting (5,5), the snake can move left towards (0,5), which is another apple. \n\nBut (0,5) is five steps left from (5,5). \n\nAlternatively, after getting (6,6), the snake can move towards (9,0), which is three steps right and six steps down. \n\nBut that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), the snake can move left to (5,6), then down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nSo maybe going for (6,6) first allows me to collect two apples in sequence. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is more central, allowing access to other apples. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go right first towards (6,6), as that apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) is better because it leads to another apple. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,9). They might be moving towards the apples as well. \n\nThe apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both in the middle of the board. The enemy is at (4,9), which is top-left. So maybe they are closer to (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nBut the enemy's position is (4,9). To get to (5,5), they need to move down four steps and right one. To get to (6,6), they need to move down three steps and right two. \n\nSo maybe the enemy is more likely to go towards (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nIf that's the case, then maybe I should go for (6,6) to avoid competition. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy is moving towards (5,5), then I might want to get there first. \n\nBut since the enemy's body is empty, they are just starting. So their next move could be any direction. \n\nBut without knowing their direction, it's hard to predict. \n\nIn that case, perhaps the safest move is to go for the closest apple that's less likely to be contested. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as me, and the enemy is far away. So moving left three times to get it. \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nBut maybe that's a safer option. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nSo, considering all possibilities, I think the best initial move is to go DOWN towards (5,5). \n\nBecause it's a direct path, and after collecting that apple, I can head towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,7) then down to (6,6) is also good. \n\nBut I need to choose one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is in a position that's easier to reach other apples from. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a more central location, making it easier to navigate to other apples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go RIGHT first. \n\nBecause moving right to (6,7) and then down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nThen, after that, I can move left to (5,6) and down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to go for the apple that's directly below me. \n\nSo, after considering all options, I think moving DOWN is the best first move. \n\nSo the next direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After moving down to (5,6), plan to go down again to (5,5) to eat the apple. Then consider heading left towards (0,5) while avoiding collisions.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation again. My snake is at (5,6) after moving DOWN from (5,7) in the last turn. The apples are still at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), and (6,6). The enemy snake #2 is at (5,9) with an empty body.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6) are UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), or RIGHT to (6,6). \n\nFirst, check for immediate apples. Moving DOWN to (5,5) would directly eat the apple there, which is great. That would grow my snake and give me a point. Moving RIGHT to (6,6) also leads to an apple. Both are valid options. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,5), that's the quickest way to get an apple. After eating it, my body would extend, so the next move can't go back up to (5,6). But since the enemy is at (5,9), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) also gets an apple. However, after that, I would be at (6,6), and the next move could be LEFT to (5,6) (but that's my previous position, which is part of my body now) or DOWN to (6,5), etc. But moving RIGHT now would secure another apple quickly. \n\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (6,6), I eat the apple there. Then my body would be (5,6) and (5,7) from before. Wait, no. Let me clarify the body positions. \n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,6) in the last move, the snake's body is now at (5,6) and the previous position (5,7) is part of the body. So if I move RIGHT to (6,6), the new head is at (6,6), and the body becomes (5,6) and (5,7). But since I ate an apple, the body grows by one, so the tail stays. Wait, the rules might differ, but typically, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a segment. So after moving into (6,6), the body would be (5,6) and the new head at (6,6), with the tail remaining at (5,7) if not moved. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here. \n\nBut the main point is, moving DOWN to (5,5) gives an immediate apple, and moving RIGHT to (6,6) also does. Both are valid. \n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (5,5) is a straight path and avoids potential conflicts. The enemy is at (5,9), so they might be moving down towards (5,5) as well. But since they're at (5,9), they need four moves down to reach (5,5). I can get there in one move. So I should prioritize that. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) is also safe. But which apple is more strategic? (5,5) is central, allowing access to other apples like (0,5) or (2,7). (6,6) is closer to (9,0), but that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering efficiency, moving DOWN to (5,5) is better. It's a direct path, and after eating, I can plan to move left towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nAnother consideration: if I move DOWN to (5,5), the next move can't be UP back to (5,6) because that's my body. So after eating, I need to choose LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But (5,5) is at the bottom edge (y=5), so moving DOWN would go to (5,4), which is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, moving DOWN to (5,5) secures an apple immediately and positions me to plan the next move towards other apples. It's the safest and most efficient choice.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After eating the apple at (5,5), consider moving LEFT towards (0,5) while avoiding the body.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (5,7) are UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), or RIGHT to (6,7). \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5) which is two steps down from me, (2,7) which is three steps left, and (6,6) which is one step right and one down. Wait, (6,6) is actually diagonally down-right from (5,7). So to get there, I need to move right to (6,7) then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which isn't an apple. Hmm. Alternatively, if I go down first to (5,6), then right to (6,6), but that's two moves. But maybe the apple at (6,6) is a good target. \n\nBut there's also the apple at (2,7) which is three steps left. So moving left three times from (5,7) would get me there. But moving left three times would require checking if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away. So the path to (2,7) is clear? Let me check the board state again. The board shows at row 7 (y=7), the snake is at (5,7), and there's an apple at (2,7). So from (5,7) moving left three times would reach (2,7). But each move left would be to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7). Are there any snakes in that path? The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is two rows up. So (4,7) is safe. So that path is clear. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down twice. But moving down once to (5,6) would get me closer. But (5,6) is not an apple. Wait, the apples listed include (5,5), which is two steps down. So moving down twice would get me there. But maybe that's a longer path. \n\nAlso, the apple at (6,6) is one step right and one down. So moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to get the apple. But that's two moves. But maybe that's a good path. \n\nBut I need to choose the next immediate direction. So which direction now gives me the best path towards an apple without danger. Let's check possible dangers. \n\nIf I move UP to (5,8), that's empty. Then next move could be towards an apple. But there's no apple in that direction immediately. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,6), then next move could be down again to (5,5) to get the apple. That's two moves. But moving down now would take me closer. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7), then next left to (3,7), then (2,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. But each step left is safe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next down to (6,6) to get the apple. That's two moves. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Going left towards (2,7) takes three moves but gets an apple. \n- Going down towards (5,5) takes two moves. \n- Going right then down to (6,6) takes two moves. \n\nWhich is the shortest path? The apple at (6,6) is two moves away (right then down), but the apple at (5,5) is two moves down. The apple at (2,7) is three moves left. \n\nBut the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Let's count the steps. From (5,7):\n\nTo (6,6): right then down. Two steps. \n\nTo (5,5): down twice. Two steps. \n\nTo (2,7): left three steps. \n\nSo the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. But (5,5) is directly down, while (6,6) requires right then down. \n\nBut which direction should I choose first? Let's think about possible collisions. \n\nIf I move down now to (5,6), then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. That's safe. But what's at (5,6)? The board shows that row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (6,6). So (5,6) is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) which is an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nBut moving right first: (6,7) is empty. Then next move down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nSo both paths are possible. \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for other snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,9). So their head is at (4,9). They might be moving around, but since their body is empty, they can't block me immediately. \n\nSo both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) would take longer, but maybe that's a less contested apple. \n\nBut since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe going for the closest ones first. \n\nSo between (5,5) and (6,6), which is better? \n\nIf I go down now, I can get to (5,5) in two moves. But moving down now would take me to (5,6), which is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right now to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to get that apple. \n\nWhich path is better? Let's see. \n\nIf I go down now, then next move down again. But after eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow. Then I need to plan the next move. \n\nAlternatively, moving right then down. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (6,6) is in the same row as the enemy snake's position (4,9) is in row 9. So maybe that area is less contested. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (5,5) is closer. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly below me. So moving down twice. \n\nBut maybe the enemy snake could also be heading towards that apple. But since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,6) is near another apple at (5,5). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) could be a longer path, but maybe there's less competition. \n\nBut since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far from (2,7), maybe that's a safer apple. \n\nBut I need to choose the next direction. \n\nSo possible options:\n\n1. Move DOWN towards (5,5). \n\n2. Move RIGHT towards (6,6). \n\n3. Move LEFT towards (2,7). \n\n4. Move UP, but that's away from apples. \n\nMoving UP would take me to (5,8), which is empty. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best choice. \n\nSo between DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT. \n\nWhich is the best first move? \n\nIf I choose DOWN now, then next move is DOWN again. But after that, I'll have to find another apple. \n\nIf I choose RIGHT now, then next move is DOWN to get the apple. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, then next moves are LEFT again. \n\nBut considering the number of steps, the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (6,6) is better because after eating it, I can then move towards other apples. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,5), I can go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nBut (0,5) is to the left, and (9,0) is far to the right and down. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) by moving right and down. \n\nBut maybe the path to (6,6) is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6) and then down to (5,5) gives me an apple. \n\nBut what's the risk? Are there any obstacles in those positions? \n\nThe board shows that (5,6) is empty. (5,5) is an apple. \n\nSo moving down is safe. \n\nSimilarly, moving right to (6,7) is safe. \n\nSo both options are safe. \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the snake grows. So the body will extend. But since the snake's body is only the head right now (since the last move was None, implying it's the start?), then after eating an apple, the body will be longer. \n\nWait, the snake's current position is (5,7). The body is just the head. So moving to an apple will make the body length 2. \n\nSo after eating an apple, the next move will have to avoid running into the body. \n\nBut since the body is just the previous position, which is (5,7) if I move down to (5,6), then the next move can't go back to (5,7). \n\nBut that's standard snake behavior. \n\nSo, perhaps the best first move is to go for the closest apple. \n\nBut which is closer? (5,5) is two steps down, (6,6) is two steps (right then down), (2,7) is three steps left. \n\nSo (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps. \n\nBut (5,5) is directly down, so moving down twice. \n\nAlternatively, (6,6) requires moving right then down. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then proceed towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then maybe go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as my current position. So moving left three times would get me there. But that's three moves. \n\nBut perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe the path is safe. \n\nBut I need to choose the first move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to go for the apple that's in the same row, (2,7). So moving left three times. \n\nBut that's three moves. But maybe after getting that apple, I can go down towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nBut is that the best option? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, (5,7) to (6,6) is one step right and one down. So Manhattan distance is 2. Same as (5,5). \n\nBut the path to (6,6) requires moving right first. \n\nBut moving right now would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6), then down to (5,5). \n\nSo both options are two steps. \n\nBut which path is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, where can I go next. \n\nIf I go to (5,5), then I can move left towards (0,5) or right towards (6,6) again. \n\nIf I go to (6,6), then I can move towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), etc., towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo maybe going for (5,5) first allows me to then go towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) but that's a long path. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is better because it's in a less crowded area. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a central location, making it easier to reach other apples. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest first move is to go down towards (5,5). \n\nBecause moving down now to (5,6) is safe, and then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7) is safe, then down to (6,6). \n\nBut which is better? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer to other apples. For example, after getting (6,6), I can go to (9,0) or (5,5). \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), moving left to (5,6) then down to (5,5). \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) allows me to collect two apples in sequence: (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is to go down. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving down first towards (5,5) is a good choice. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down now to (5,6), then down again to (5,5). \n\nBut after that, the snake's body would be at (5,7) and (5,6), so the next move can't go back up. \n\nBut after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the body would be (5,7) and (5,6), and the new head at (5,5). \n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So when you move into the apple, you add a segment. \n\nSo if the snake is at (5,7), and moves down to (5,6), which is not an apple. Then next move down to (5,5), which is an apple. So after moving into (5,5), the snake's body would be (5,6) and (5,7), and the head at (5,5). So the length is 3. \n\nBut the initial length is 1. So moving to (5,6) (no apple) makes the body length 2. Then moving to (5,5) (apple) makes the body length 3. \n\nSo after eating the apple, the snake's body is (5,6), (5,7), and head at (5,5). \n\nSo the next move after that would have to avoid going back to (5,6). \n\nBut that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, if I go right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) (apple). Then the body would be (5,7), (6,7), and head at (6,6). So length 3. \n\nSo both paths result in the same length. \n\nBut which path allows for more future moves? \n\nAfter getting (5,5), the snake can move left towards (0,5), which is another apple. \n\nBut (0,5) is five steps left from (5,5). \n\nAlternatively, after getting (6,6), the snake can move towards (9,0), which is three steps right and six steps down. \n\nBut that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), the snake can move left to (5,6), then down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nSo maybe going for (6,6) first allows me to collect two apples in sequence. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is more central, allowing access to other apples. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go right first towards (6,6), as that apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) is better because it leads to another apple. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,9). They might be moving towards the apples as well. \n\nThe apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both in the middle of the board. The enemy is at (4,9), which is top-left. So maybe they are closer to (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nBut the enemy's position is (4,9). To get to (5,5), they need to move down four steps and right one. To get to (6,6), they need to move down three steps and right two. \n\nSo maybe the enemy is more likely to go towards (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nIf that's the case, then maybe I should go for (6,6) to avoid competition. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy is moving towards (5,5), then I might want to get there first. \n\nBut since the enemy's body is empty, they are just starting. So their next move could be any direction. \n\nBut without knowing their direction, it's hard to predict. \n\nIn that case, perhaps the safest move is to go for the closest apple that's less likely to be contested. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as me, and the enemy is far away. So moving left three times to get it. \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nBut maybe that's a safer option. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nSo, considering all possibilities, I think the best initial move is to go DOWN towards (5,5). \n\nBecause it's a direct path, and after collecting that apple, I can head towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,7) then down to (6,6) is also good. \n\nBut I need to choose one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is in a position that's easier to reach other apples from. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a more central location, making it easier to navigate to other apples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go RIGHT first. \n\nBecause moving right to (6,7) and then down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nThen, after that, I can move left to (5,6) and down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to go for the apple that's directly below me. \n\nSo, after considering all options, I think moving DOWN is the best first move. \n\nSo the next direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After moving down to (5,6), plan to go down again to (5,5) to eat the apple. Then consider heading left towards (0,5) while avoiding collisions.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation again. My snake is at (5,6) after moving DOWN from (5,7) in the last turn. The apples are still at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), and (6,6). The enemy snake #2 is at (5,9) with an empty body.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6) are UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), or RIGHT to (6,6). \n\nFirst, check for immediate apples. Moving DOWN to (5,5) would directly eat the apple there, which is great. That would grow my snake and give me a point. Moving RIGHT to (6,6) also leads to an apple. Both are valid options. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,5), that's the quickest way to get an apple. After eating it, my body would extend, so the next move can't go back up to (5,6). But since the enemy is at (5,9), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) also gets an apple. However, after that, I would be at (6,6), and the next move could be LEFT to (5,6) (but that's my previous position, which is part of my body now) or DOWN to (6,5), etc. But moving RIGHT now would secure another apple quickly. \n\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (6,6), I eat the apple there. Then my body would be (5,6) and (5,7) from before. Wait, no. Let me clarify the body positions. \n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,6) in the last move, the snake's body is now at (5,6) and the previous position (5,7) is part of the body. So if I move RIGHT to (6,6), the new head is at (6,6), and the body becomes (5,6) and (5,7). But since I ate an apple, the body grows by one, so the tail stays. Wait, the rules might differ, but typically, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a segment. So after moving into (6,6), the body would be (5,6) and the new head at (6,6), with the tail remaining at (5,7) if not moved. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here. \n\nBut the main point is, moving DOWN to (5,5) gives an immediate apple, and moving RIGHT to (6,6) also does. Both are valid. \n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (5,5) is a straight path and avoids potential conflicts. The enemy is at (5,9), so they might be moving down towards (5,5) as well. But since they're at (5,9), they need four moves down to reach (5,5). I can get there in one move. So I should prioritize that. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) is also safe. But which apple is more strategic? (5,5) is central, allowing access to other apples like (0,5) or (2,7). (6,6) is closer to (9,0), but that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering efficiency, moving DOWN to (5,5) is better. It's a direct path, and after eating, I can plan to move left towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nAnother consideration: if I move DOWN to (5,5), the next move can't be UP back to (5,6) because that's my body. So after eating, I need to choose LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But (5,5) is at the bottom edge (y=5), so moving DOWN would go to (5,4), which is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, moving DOWN to (5,5) secures an apple immediately and positions me to plan the next move towards other apples. It's the safest and most efficient choice.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After eating the apple at (5,5), consider moving LEFT towards (0,5) while avoiding the body.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (5,5) after moving DOWN to eat the apple there. Now, the apples left are at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), and (3,7). Wait, no\u2014the initial apples were (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). But when I moved DOWN to (5,5), that apple was eaten, so now the remaining apples are (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7) minus (5,5). Wait, no\u2014the initial list in the problem statement says apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). Wait, but in the previous move, the user mentioned that after moving DOWN to (5,6), the apples were at (5,5), but that might have been a typo. Wait, the original problem states apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). So when I moved DOWN to (5,5), that wasn't an apple. Wait, no\u2014the initial problem's apple list didn't include (5,5). Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem states: Apples at: (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). So (5,5) wasn't an apple. Wait, but in the last move information, the user said \"Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (5,5)\" and the board state shows an 'A' at (5,5) in row 5. Wait, looking at the board state:\n\nThe board state shows row 5 as \"A . . . . 1 . . . .\", which is y=5. So (5,5) is where the snake is, and there's an 'A' at (0,5) (x=0, y=5). Wait, no\u2014the row 5 in the board is y=5. The columns are x from 0 to 9. So row 5 (y=5) has an 'A' at x=0 (0,5), then the snake at x=5 (5,5). So the apple at (0,5) is still present. So in the previous move, moving DOWN to (5,5) didn't eat an apple because there was no apple there. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nOriginal problem's apples are at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). The board state shows:\n\nRow 5 (y=5): A . . . . 1 . . . . \n\nSo at (0,5) (x=0, y=5) there's an 'A', and the snake is at (5,5). So in the last move, the snake was at (5,6) after moving DOWN from (5,7). Then the user's last move was DOWN to (5,5), which is the current position. But (5,5) wasn't an apple. So that move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the apples are still at the original positions. So the current apples are (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). \n\nSo now, the snake is at (5,5). Possible moves: UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5). \n\nNeed to check which directions are safe. The snake's body after moving to (5,5) would have the previous position at (5,6) as part of the body. So moving UP back to (5,6) would collide with its own body, which is a death. So UP is invalid. \n\nSo possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nLooking for apples nearby. The closest apples are (0,5) (same y, x=0), (6,6) (x=6, y=6), (3,7) (x=3, y=7), (2,7) (x=2, y=7), and (9,0) (x=9, y=0). \n\nFrom (5,5), moving LEFT towards (0,5) would require moving left multiple times. But moving LEFT once to (4,5) doesn't reach an apple. The apple at (0,5) is 5 steps left. Moving RIGHT to (6,5) is one step, but the apple at (6,6) is one step up from (6,5). So if I move RIGHT to (6,5), then next move UP to (6,6) would get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) doesn't lead to an apple immediately. The apple at (9,0) is far. \n\nAnother option: moving LEFT to (4,5), then continue left towards (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) to eat the apple there. That seems more efficient. \n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. The enemy snake #2 is at (6,9) with body at []. So they are at (6,9), which is far from (6,5). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. \n\nSo the plan: move RIGHT to (6,5), then next turn move UP to (6,6) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT towards (0,5) but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's position. If snake #2 is at (6,9), they might be moving down towards the apples. But they are far away. \n\nSo the best immediate move is RIGHT to (6,5), setting up to get the apple at (6,6) next. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards (0,5), but that's a longer path and might not be as efficient. \n\nSo the optimal move is RIGHT to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) next turn. \n\nCheck for safety: moving RIGHT to (6,5) is within the board (x=6 is valid). No snakes are there. The enemy is at (6,9), so no collision. \n\nTherefore, the direction should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** Move UP to (6,6) to eat the apple there.  \n**Direction:** RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (5,7). The apples are at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6). The enemy snake is at (4,9) with an empty body. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (5,7) are UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), or RIGHT to (6,7). \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5) which is two steps down from me, (2,7) which is three steps left, and (6,6) which is one step right and one down. Wait, (6,6) is actually diagonally down-right from (5,7). So to get there, I need to move right to (6,7) then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which isn't an apple. Hmm. Alternatively, if I go down first to (5,6), then right to (6,6), but that's two moves. But maybe the apple at (6,6) is a good target. \n\nBut there's also the apple at (2,7) which is three steps left. So moving left three times from (5,7) would get me there. But moving left three times would require checking if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away. So the path to (2,7) is clear? Let me check the board state again. The board shows at row 7 (y=7), the snake is at (5,7), and there's an apple at (2,7). So from (5,7) moving left three times would reach (2,7). But each move left would be to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7). Are there any snakes in that path? The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is two rows up. So (4,7) is safe. So that path is clear. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down twice. But moving down once to (5,6) would get me closer. But (5,6) is not an apple. Wait, the apples listed include (5,5), which is two steps down. So moving down twice would get me there. But maybe that's a longer path. \n\nAlso, the apple at (6,6) is one step right and one down. So moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to get the apple. But that's two moves. But maybe that's a good path. \n\nBut I need to choose the next immediate direction. So which direction now gives me the best path towards an apple without danger. Let's check possible dangers. \n\nIf I move UP to (5,8), that's empty. Then next move could be towards an apple. But there's no apple in that direction immediately. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,6), then next move could be down again to (5,5) to get the apple. That's two moves. But moving down now would take me closer. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7), then next left to (3,7), then (2,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. But each step left is safe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next down to (6,6) to get the apple. That's two moves. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Going left towards (2,7) takes three moves but gets an apple. \n- Going down towards (5,5) takes two moves. \n- Going right then down to (6,6) takes two moves. \n\nWhich is the shortest path? The apple at (6,6) is two moves away (right then down), but the apple at (5,5) is two moves down. The apple at (2,7) is three moves left. \n\nBut the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Let's count the steps. From (5,7):\n\nTo (6,6): right then down. Two steps. \n\nTo (5,5): down twice. Two steps. \n\nTo (2,7): left three steps. \n\nSo the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. But (5,5) is directly down, while (6,6) requires right then down. \n\nBut which direction should I choose first? Let's think about possible collisions. \n\nIf I move down now to (5,6), then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. That's safe. But what's at (5,6)? The board shows that row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (6,6). So (5,6) is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) which is an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nBut moving right first: (6,7) is empty. Then next move down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nSo both paths are possible. \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for other snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,9). So their head is at (4,9). They might be moving around, but since their body is empty, they can't block me immediately. \n\nSo both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) would take longer, but maybe that's a less contested apple. \n\nBut since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe going for the closest ones first. \n\nSo between (5,5) and (6,6), which is better? \n\nIf I go down now, I can get to (5,5) in two moves. But moving down now would take me to (5,6), which is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right now to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to get that apple. \n\nWhich path is better? Let's see. \n\nIf I go down now, then next move down again. But after eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow. Then I need to plan the next move. \n\nAlternatively, moving right then down. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (6,6) is in the same row as the enemy snake's position (4,9) is in row 9. So maybe that area is less contested. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (5,5) is closer. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly below me. So moving down twice. \n\nBut maybe the enemy snake could also be heading towards that apple. But since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,6) is near another apple at (5,5). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) could be a longer path, but maybe there's less competition. \n\nBut since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far from (2,7), maybe that's a safer apple. \n\nBut I need to choose the next direction. \n\nSo possible options:\n\n1. Move DOWN towards (5,5). \n\n2. Move RIGHT towards (6,6). \n\n3. Move LEFT towards (2,7). \n\n4. Move UP, but that's away from apples. \n\nMoving UP would take me to (5,8), which is empty. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best choice. \n\nSo between DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT. \n\nWhich is the best first move? \n\nIf I choose DOWN now, then next move is DOWN again. But after that, I'll have to find another apple. \n\nIf I choose RIGHT now, then next move is DOWN to get the apple. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, then next moves are LEFT again. \n\nBut considering the number of steps, the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (6,6) is better because after eating it, I can then move towards other apples. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,5), I can go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nBut (0,5) is to the left, and (9,0) is far to the right and down. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) by moving right and down. \n\nBut maybe the path to (6,6) is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6) and then down to (5,5) gives me an apple. \n\nBut what's the risk? Are there any obstacles in those positions? \n\nThe board shows that (5,6) is empty. (5,5) is an apple. \n\nSo moving down is safe. \n\nSimilarly, moving right to (6,7) is safe. \n\nSo both options are safe. \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the snake grows. So the body will extend. But since the snake's body is only the head right now (since the last move was None, implying it's the start?), then after eating an apple, the body will be longer. \n\nWait, the snake's current position is (5,7). The body is just the head. So moving to an apple will make the body length 2. \n\nSo after eating an apple, the next move will have to avoid running into the body. \n\nBut since the body is just the previous position, which is (5,7) if I move down to (5,6), then the next move can't go back to (5,7). \n\nBut that's standard snake behavior. \n\nSo, perhaps the best first move is to go for the closest apple. \n\nBut which is closer? (5,5) is two steps down, (6,6) is two steps (right then down), (2,7) is three steps left. \n\nSo (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps. \n\nBut (5,5) is directly down, so moving down twice. \n\nAlternatively, (6,6) requires moving right then down. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then proceed towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then maybe go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as my current position. So moving left three times would get me there. But that's three moves. \n\nBut perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe the path is safe. \n\nBut I need to choose the first move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to go for the apple that's in the same row, (2,7). So moving left three times. \n\nBut that's three moves. But maybe after getting that apple, I can go down towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nBut is that the best option? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, (5,7) to (6,6) is one step right and one down. So Manhattan distance is 2. Same as (5,5). \n\nBut the path to (6,6) requires moving right first. \n\nBut moving right now would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6), then down to (5,5). \n\nSo both options are two steps. \n\nBut which path is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, where can I go next. \n\nIf I go to (5,5), then I can move left towards (0,5) or right towards (6,6) again. \n\nIf I go to (6,6), then I can move towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), etc., towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo maybe going for (5,5) first allows me to then go towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) but that's a long path. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is better because it's in a less crowded area. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a central location, making it easier to reach other apples. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest first move is to go down towards (5,5). \n\nBecause moving down now to (5,6) is safe, and then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7) is safe, then down to (6,6). \n\nBut which is better? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer to other apples. For example, after getting (6,6), I can go to (9,0) or (5,5). \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), moving left to (5,6) then down to (5,5). \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) allows me to collect two apples in sequence: (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is to go down. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving down first towards (5,5) is a good choice. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down now to (5,6), then down again to (5,5). \n\nBut after that, the snake's body would be at (5,7) and (5,6), so the next move can't go back up. \n\nBut after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the body would be (5,7) and (5,6), and the new head at (5,5). \n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So when you move into the apple, you add a segment. \n\nSo if the snake is at (5,7), and moves down to (5,6), which is not an apple. Then next move down to (5,5), which is an apple. So after moving into (5,5), the snake's body would be (5,6) and (5,7), and the head at (5,5). So the length is 3. \n\nBut the initial length is 1. So moving to (5,6) (no apple) makes the body length 2. Then moving to (5,5) (apple) makes the body length 3. \n\nSo after eating the apple, the snake's body is (5,6), (5,7), and head at (5,5). \n\nSo the next move after that would have to avoid going back to (5,6). \n\nBut that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, if I go right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) (apple). Then the body would be (5,7), (6,7), and head at (6,6). So length 3. \n\nSo both paths result in the same length. \n\nBut which path allows for more future moves? \n\nAfter getting (5,5), the snake can move left towards (0,5), which is another apple. \n\nBut (0,5) is five steps left from (5,5). \n\nAlternatively, after getting (6,6), the snake can move towards (9,0), which is three steps right and six steps down. \n\nBut that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), the snake can move left to (5,6), then down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nSo maybe going for (6,6) first allows me to collect two apples in sequence. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is more central, allowing access to other apples. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go right first towards (6,6), as that apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) is better because it leads to another apple. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,9). They might be moving towards the apples as well. \n\nThe apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both in the middle of the board. The enemy is at (4,9), which is top-left. So maybe they are closer to (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nBut the enemy's position is (4,9). To get to (5,5), they need to move down four steps and right one. To get to (6,6), they need to move down three steps and right two. \n\nSo maybe the enemy is more likely to go towards (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nIf that's the case, then maybe I should go for (6,6) to avoid competition. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy is moving towards (5,5), then I might want to get there first. \n\nBut since the enemy's body is empty, they are just starting. So their next move could be any direction. \n\nBut without knowing their direction, it's hard to predict. \n\nIn that case, perhaps the safest move is to go for the closest apple that's less likely to be contested. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as me, and the enemy is far away. So moving left three times to get it. \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nBut maybe that's a safer option. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nSo, considering all possibilities, I think the best initial move is to go DOWN towards (5,5). \n\nBecause it's a direct path, and after collecting that apple, I can head towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,7) then down to (6,6) is also good. \n\nBut I need to choose one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is in a position that's easier to reach other apples from. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a more central location, making it easier to navigate to other apples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go RIGHT first. \n\nBecause moving right to (6,7) and then down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nThen, after that, I can move left to (5,6) and down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to go for the apple that's directly below me. \n\nSo, after considering all options, I think moving DOWN is the best first move. \n\nSo the next direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After moving down to (5,6), plan to go down again to (5,5) to eat the apple. Then consider heading left towards (0,5) while avoiding collisions.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation again. My snake is at (5,6) after moving DOWN from (5,7) in the last turn. The apples are still at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), and (6,6). The enemy snake #2 is at (5,9) with an empty body.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6) are UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), or RIGHT to (6,6). \n\nFirst, check for immediate apples. Moving DOWN to (5,5) would directly eat the apple there, which is great. That would grow my snake and give me a point. Moving RIGHT to (6,6) also leads to an apple. Both are valid options. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,5), that's the quickest way to get an apple. After eating it, my body would extend, so the next move can't go back up to (5,6). But since the enemy is at (5,9), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) also gets an apple. However, after that, I would be at (6,6), and the next move could be LEFT to (5,6) (but that's my previous position, which is part of my body now) or DOWN to (6,5), etc. But moving RIGHT now would secure another apple quickly. \n\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (6,6), I eat the apple there. Then my body would be (5,6) and (5,7) from before. Wait, no. Let me clarify the body positions. \n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,6) in the last move, the snake's body is now at (5,6) and the previous position (5,7) is part of the body. So if I move RIGHT to (6,6), the new head is at (6,6), and the body becomes (5,6) and (5,7). But since I ate an apple, the body grows by one, so the tail stays. Wait, the rules might differ, but typically, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a segment. So after moving into (6,6), the body would be (5,6) and the new head at (6,6), with the tail remaining at (5,7) if not moved. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here. \n\nBut the main point is, moving DOWN to (5,5) gives an immediate apple, and moving RIGHT to (6,6) also does. Both are valid. \n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (5,5) is a straight path and avoids potential conflicts. The enemy is at (5,9), so they might be moving down towards (5,5) as well. But since they're at (5,9), they need four moves down to reach (5,5). I can get there in one move. So I should prioritize that. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) is also safe. But which apple is more strategic? (5,5) is central, allowing access to other apples like (0,5) or (2,7). (6,6) is closer to (9,0), but that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering efficiency, moving DOWN to (5,5) is better. It's a direct path, and after eating, I can plan to move left towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nAnother consideration: if I move DOWN to (5,5), the next move can't be UP back to (5,6) because that's my body. So after eating, I need to choose LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But (5,5) is at the bottom edge (y=5), so moving DOWN would go to (5,4), which is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, moving DOWN to (5,5) secures an apple immediately and positions me to plan the next move towards other apples. It's the safest and most efficient choice.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After eating the apple at (5,5), consider moving LEFT towards (0,5) while avoiding the body.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (5,5) after moving DOWN to eat the apple there. Now, the apples left are at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), and (3,7). Wait, no\u2014the initial apples were (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). But when I moved DOWN to (5,5), that apple was eaten, so now the remaining apples are (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7) minus (5,5). Wait, no\u2014the initial list in the problem statement says apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). Wait, but in the previous move, the user mentioned that after moving DOWN to (5,6), the apples were at (5,5), but that might have been a typo. Wait, the original problem states apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). So when I moved DOWN to (5,5), that wasn't an apple. Wait, no\u2014the initial problem's apple list didn't include (5,5). Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem states: Apples at: (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). So (5,5) wasn't an apple. Wait, but in the last move information, the user said \"Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (5,5)\" and the board state shows an 'A' at (5,5) in row 5. Wait, looking at the board state:\n\nThe board state shows row 5 as \"A . . . . 1 . . . .\", which is y=5. So (5,5) is where the snake is, and there's an 'A' at (0,5) (x=0, y=5). Wait, no\u2014the row 5 in the board is y=5. The columns are x from 0 to 9. So row 5 (y=5) has an 'A' at x=0 (0,5), then the snake at x=5 (5,5). So the apple at (0,5) is still present. So in the previous move, moving DOWN to (5,5) didn't eat an apple because there was no apple there. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nOriginal problem's apples are at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). The board state shows:\n\nRow 5 (y=5): A . . . . 1 . . . . \n\nSo at (0,5) (x=0, y=5) there's an 'A', and the snake is at (5,5). So in the last move, the snake was at (5,6) after moving DOWN from (5,7). Then the user's last move was DOWN to (5,5), which is the current position. But (5,5) wasn't an apple. So that move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the apples are still at the original positions. So the current apples are (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). \n\nSo now, the snake is at (5,5). Possible moves: UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5). \n\nNeed to check which directions are safe. The snake's body after moving to (5,5) would have the previous position at (5,6) as part of the body. So moving UP back to (5,6) would collide with its own body, which is a death. So UP is invalid. \n\nSo possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nLooking for apples nearby. The closest apples are (0,5) (same y, x=0), (6,6) (x=6, y=6), (3,7) (x=3, y=7), (2,7) (x=2, y=7), and (9,0) (x=9, y=0). \n\nFrom (5,5), moving LEFT towards (0,5) would require moving left multiple times. But moving LEFT once to (4,5) doesn't reach an apple. The apple at (0,5) is 5 steps left. Moving RIGHT to (6,5) is one step, but the apple at (6,6) is one step up from (6,5). So if I move RIGHT to (6,5), then next move UP to (6,6) would get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) doesn't lead to an apple immediately. The apple at (9,0) is far. \n\nAnother option: moving LEFT to (4,5), then continue left towards (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) to eat the apple there. That seems more efficient. \n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. The enemy snake #2 is at (6,9) with body at []. So they are at (6,9), which is far from (6,5). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. \n\nSo the plan: move RIGHT to (6,5), then next turn move UP to (6,6) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT towards (0,5) but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's position. If snake #2 is at (6,9), they might be moving down towards the apples. But they are far away. \n\nSo the best immediate move is RIGHT to (6,5), setting up to get the apple at (6,6) next. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards (0,5), but that's a longer path and might not be as efficient. \n\nSo the optimal move is RIGHT to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) next turn. \n\nCheck for safety: moving RIGHT to (6,5) is within the board (x=6 is valid). No snakes are there. The enemy is at (6,9), so no collision. \n\nTherefore, the direction should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** Move UP to (6,6) to eat the apple there.  \n**Direction:** RIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (7,9) with no body segments, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, check possible moves from (6,5). The options are UP to (6,6), DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5), or RIGHT to (7,5). \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,6) directly above. Moving UP to (6,6) would eat that apple, which is great for points. But need to ensure that path is safe. \n\nCheck if (6,6) is a valid move. The board shows an 'A' there, so it's an apple. Moving into it is safe and beneficial. However, after eating, the snake's body would grow. But since the enemy snake is at (7,9), which is far away, there's no immediate collision threat there. \n\nOther directions: Moving RIGHT to (7,5) would take me closer to the enemy's position at (7,9), but they're still four steps up. Not an immediate threat. Moving LEFT to (5,5) would retrace the previous step, but since the snake's body hasn't grown yet (assuming it didn't eat an apple in the last move), that's safe. Wait, the last move was RIGHT to (6,5), so the previous position was (5,5). If the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, then the body is only the current head. So moving LEFT back to (5,5) would not collide with itself. \n\nBut the goal is to maximize points. The apple at (6,6) is the closest. So moving UP is the best option. \n\nCheck for walls: (6,6) is within the 10x10 grid. No walls there. No other snakes in that spot. So moving UP is safe and gets the apple. \n\nAlternative options: If I move RIGHT to (7,5), then next move could be towards (9,0), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN or LEFT doesn't lead to apples immediately. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is UP to (6,6) to eat the apple and gain a point. \n\nNext turn's strategy: After eating the apple, the snake's body will grow. Need to plan the next move carefully to avoid self-collision. From (6,6), possible moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but need to avoid moving back to (6,5) if the body is there. But since the snake just ate the apple, the body would extend, so the tail would stay in place. Wait, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, the body grows by one segment. So after moving to (6,6), the body would include (6,5) and the previous positions. So next move can't go back to (6,5) if the body is there. But since the snake was at (6,5) and moves to (6,6), the body would now be [(6,5)]. So next turn, moving back to (6,5) would collide with the body. Therefore, next turn, avoid moving DOWN to (6,5). \n\nBut for this current move, moving UP is safe and beneficial. So the decision is to move UP.\n</think>\n\nUP  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** Avoid moving back DOWN to (6,5) to prevent self-collision.  \n**Direction:** UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (5,7). The apples are at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6). The enemy snake is at (4,9) with an empty body. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (5,7) are UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), or RIGHT to (6,7). \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5) which is two steps down from me, (2,7) which is three steps left, and (6,6) which is one step right and one down. Wait, (6,6) is actually diagonally down-right from (5,7). So to get there, I need to move right to (6,7) then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which isn't an apple. Hmm. Alternatively, if I go down first to (5,6), then right to (6,6), but that's two moves. But maybe the apple at (6,6) is a good target. \n\nBut there's also the apple at (2,7) which is three steps left. So moving left three times from (5,7) would get me there. But moving left three times would require checking if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away. So the path to (2,7) is clear? Let me check the board state again. The board shows at row 7 (y=7), the snake is at (5,7), and there's an apple at (2,7). So from (5,7) moving left three times would reach (2,7). But each move left would be to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7). Are there any snakes in that path? The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is two rows up. So (4,7) is safe. So that path is clear. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down twice. But moving down once to (5,6) would get me closer. But (5,6) is not an apple. Wait, the apples listed include (5,5), which is two steps down. So moving down twice would get me there. But maybe that's a longer path. \n\nAlso, the apple at (6,6) is one step right and one down. So moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to get the apple. But that's two moves. But maybe that's a good path. \n\nBut I need to choose the next immediate direction. So which direction now gives me the best path towards an apple without danger. Let's check possible dangers. \n\nIf I move UP to (5,8), that's empty. Then next move could be towards an apple. But there's no apple in that direction immediately. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,6), then next move could be down again to (5,5) to get the apple. That's two moves. But moving down now would take me closer. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7), then next left to (3,7), then (2,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. But each step left is safe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next down to (6,6) to get the apple. That's two moves. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Going left towards (2,7) takes three moves but gets an apple. \n- Going down towards (5,5) takes two moves. \n- Going right then down to (6,6) takes two moves. \n\nWhich is the shortest path? The apple at (6,6) is two moves away (right then down), but the apple at (5,5) is two moves down. The apple at (2,7) is three moves left. \n\nBut the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Let's count the steps. From (5,7):\n\nTo (6,6): right then down. Two steps. \n\nTo (5,5): down twice. Two steps. \n\nTo (2,7): left three steps. \n\nSo the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. But (5,5) is directly down, while (6,6) requires right then down. \n\nBut which direction should I choose first? Let's think about possible collisions. \n\nIf I move down now to (5,6), then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. That's safe. But what's at (5,6)? The board shows that row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (6,6). So (5,6) is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) which is an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nBut moving right first: (6,7) is empty. Then next move down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nSo both paths are possible. \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for other snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,9). So their head is at (4,9). They might be moving around, but since their body is empty, they can't block me immediately. \n\nSo both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) would take longer, but maybe that's a less contested apple. \n\nBut since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe going for the closest ones first. \n\nSo between (5,5) and (6,6), which is better? \n\nIf I go down now, I can get to (5,5) in two moves. But moving down now would take me to (5,6), which is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right now to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to get that apple. \n\nWhich path is better? Let's see. \n\nIf I go down now, then next move down again. But after eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow. Then I need to plan the next move. \n\nAlternatively, moving right then down. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (6,6) is in the same row as the enemy snake's position (4,9) is in row 9. So maybe that area is less contested. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (5,5) is closer. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly below me. So moving down twice. \n\nBut maybe the enemy snake could also be heading towards that apple. But since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,6) is near another apple at (5,5). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) could be a longer path, but maybe there's less competition. \n\nBut since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far from (2,7), maybe that's a safer apple. \n\nBut I need to choose the next direction. \n\nSo possible options:\n\n1. Move DOWN towards (5,5). \n\n2. Move RIGHT towards (6,6). \n\n3. Move LEFT towards (2,7). \n\n4. Move UP, but that's away from apples. \n\nMoving UP would take me to (5,8), which is empty. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best choice. \n\nSo between DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT. \n\nWhich is the best first move? \n\nIf I choose DOWN now, then next move is DOWN again. But after that, I'll have to find another apple. \n\nIf I choose RIGHT now, then next move is DOWN to get the apple. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, then next moves are LEFT again. \n\nBut considering the number of steps, the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (6,6) is better because after eating it, I can then move towards other apples. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,5), I can go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nBut (0,5) is to the left, and (9,0) is far to the right and down. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) by moving right and down. \n\nBut maybe the path to (6,6) is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6) and then down to (5,5) gives me an apple. \n\nBut what's the risk? Are there any obstacles in those positions? \n\nThe board shows that (5,6) is empty. (5,5) is an apple. \n\nSo moving down is safe. \n\nSimilarly, moving right to (6,7) is safe. \n\nSo both options are safe. \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the snake grows. So the body will extend. But since the snake's body is only the head right now (since the last move was None, implying it's the start?), then after eating an apple, the body will be longer. \n\nWait, the snake's current position is (5,7). The body is just the head. So moving to an apple will make the body length 2. \n\nSo after eating an apple, the next move will have to avoid running into the body. \n\nBut since the body is just the previous position, which is (5,7) if I move down to (5,6), then the next move can't go back to (5,7). \n\nBut that's standard snake behavior. \n\nSo, perhaps the best first move is to go for the closest apple. \n\nBut which is closer? (5,5) is two steps down, (6,6) is two steps (right then down), (2,7) is three steps left. \n\nSo (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps. \n\nBut (5,5) is directly down, so moving down twice. \n\nAlternatively, (6,6) requires moving right then down. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then proceed towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then maybe go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as my current position. So moving left three times would get me there. But that's three moves. \n\nBut perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe the path is safe. \n\nBut I need to choose the first move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to go for the apple that's in the same row, (2,7). So moving left three times. \n\nBut that's three moves. But maybe after getting that apple, I can go down towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nBut is that the best option? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, (5,7) to (6,6) is one step right and one down. So Manhattan distance is 2. Same as (5,5). \n\nBut the path to (6,6) requires moving right first. \n\nBut moving right now would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6), then down to (5,5). \n\nSo both options are two steps. \n\nBut which path is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, where can I go next. \n\nIf I go to (5,5), then I can move left towards (0,5) or right towards (6,6) again. \n\nIf I go to (6,6), then I can move towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), etc., towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo maybe going for (5,5) first allows me to then go towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) but that's a long path. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is better because it's in a less crowded area. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a central location, making it easier to reach other apples. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest first move is to go down towards (5,5). \n\nBecause moving down now to (5,6) is safe, and then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7) is safe, then down to (6,6). \n\nBut which is better? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer to other apples. For example, after getting (6,6), I can go to (9,0) or (5,5). \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), moving left to (5,6) then down to (5,5). \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) allows me to collect two apples in sequence: (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is to go down. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving down first towards (5,5) is a good choice. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down now to (5,6), then down again to (5,5). \n\nBut after that, the snake's body would be at (5,7) and (5,6), so the next move can't go back up. \n\nBut after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the body would be (5,7) and (5,6), and the new head at (5,5). \n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So when you move into the apple, you add a segment. \n\nSo if the snake is at (5,7), and moves down to (5,6), which is not an apple. Then next move down to (5,5), which is an apple. So after moving into (5,5), the snake's body would be (5,6) and (5,7), and the head at (5,5). So the length is 3. \n\nBut the initial length is 1. So moving to (5,6) (no apple) makes the body length 2. Then moving to (5,5) (apple) makes the body length 3. \n\nSo after eating the apple, the snake's body is (5,6), (5,7), and head at (5,5). \n\nSo the next move after that would have to avoid going back to (5,6). \n\nBut that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, if I go right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) (apple). Then the body would be (5,7), (6,7), and head at (6,6). So length 3. \n\nSo both paths result in the same length. \n\nBut which path allows for more future moves? \n\nAfter getting (5,5), the snake can move left towards (0,5), which is another apple. \n\nBut (0,5) is five steps left from (5,5). \n\nAlternatively, after getting (6,6), the snake can move towards (9,0), which is three steps right and six steps down. \n\nBut that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), the snake can move left to (5,6), then down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nSo maybe going for (6,6) first allows me to collect two apples in sequence. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is more central, allowing access to other apples. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go right first towards (6,6), as that apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) is better because it leads to another apple. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,9). They might be moving towards the apples as well. \n\nThe apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both in the middle of the board. The enemy is at (4,9), which is top-left. So maybe they are closer to (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nBut the enemy's position is (4,9). To get to (5,5), they need to move down four steps and right one. To get to (6,6), they need to move down three steps and right two. \n\nSo maybe the enemy is more likely to go towards (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nIf that's the case, then maybe I should go for (6,6) to avoid competition. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy is moving towards (5,5), then I might want to get there first. \n\nBut since the enemy's body is empty, they are just starting. So their next move could be any direction. \n\nBut without knowing their direction, it's hard to predict. \n\nIn that case, perhaps the safest move is to go for the closest apple that's less likely to be contested. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as me, and the enemy is far away. So moving left three times to get it. \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nBut maybe that's a safer option. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nSo, considering all possibilities, I think the best initial move is to go DOWN towards (5,5). \n\nBecause it's a direct path, and after collecting that apple, I can head towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,7) then down to (6,6) is also good. \n\nBut I need to choose one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is in a position that's easier to reach other apples from. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a more central location, making it easier to navigate to other apples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go RIGHT first. \n\nBecause moving right to (6,7) and then down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nThen, after that, I can move left to (5,6) and down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to go for the apple that's directly below me. \n\nSo, after considering all options, I think moving DOWN is the best first move. \n\nSo the next direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After moving down to (5,6), plan to go down again to (5,5) to eat the apple. Then consider heading left towards (0,5) while avoiding collisions.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation again. My snake is at (5,6) after moving DOWN from (5,7) in the last turn. The apples are still at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), and (6,6). The enemy snake #2 is at (5,9) with an empty body.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6) are UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), or RIGHT to (6,6). \n\nFirst, check for immediate apples. Moving DOWN to (5,5) would directly eat the apple there, which is great. That would grow my snake and give me a point. Moving RIGHT to (6,6) also leads to an apple. Both are valid options. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,5), that's the quickest way to get an apple. After eating it, my body would extend, so the next move can't go back up to (5,6). But since the enemy is at (5,9), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) also gets an apple. However, after that, I would be at (6,6), and the next move could be LEFT to (5,6) (but that's my previous position, which is part of my body now) or DOWN to (6,5), etc. But moving RIGHT now would secure another apple quickly. \n\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (6,6), I eat the apple there. Then my body would be (5,6) and (5,7) from before. Wait, no. Let me clarify the body positions. \n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,6) in the last move, the snake's body is now at (5,6) and the previous position (5,7) is part of the body. So if I move RIGHT to (6,6), the new head is at (6,6), and the body becomes (5,6) and (5,7). But since I ate an apple, the body grows by one, so the tail stays. Wait, the rules might differ, but typically, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a segment. So after moving into (6,6), the body would be (5,6) and the new head at (6,6), with the tail remaining at (5,7) if not moved. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here. \n\nBut the main point is, moving DOWN to (5,5) gives an immediate apple, and moving RIGHT to (6,6) also does. Both are valid. \n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (5,5) is a straight path and avoids potential conflicts. The enemy is at (5,9), so they might be moving down towards (5,5) as well. But since they're at (5,9), they need four moves down to reach (5,5). I can get there in one move. So I should prioritize that. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) is also safe. But which apple is more strategic? (5,5) is central, allowing access to other apples like (0,5) or (2,7). (6,6) is closer to (9,0), but that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering efficiency, moving DOWN to (5,5) is better. It's a direct path, and after eating, I can plan to move left towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nAnother consideration: if I move DOWN to (5,5), the next move can't be UP back to (5,6) because that's my body. So after eating, I need to choose LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But (5,5) is at the bottom edge (y=5), so moving DOWN would go to (5,4), which is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, moving DOWN to (5,5) secures an apple immediately and positions me to plan the next move towards other apples. It's the safest and most efficient choice.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After eating the apple at (5,5), consider moving LEFT towards (0,5) while avoiding the body.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

Wait, no\u2014the initial apples were (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). But when I moved DOWN to (5,5), that apple was eaten, so now the remaining apples are (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7) minus (5,5). Wait, no\u2014the initial list in the problem statement says apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). Wait, but in the previous move, the user mentioned that after moving DOWN to (5,6), the apples were at (5,5), but that might have been a typo. Wait, the original problem states apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). So when I moved DOWN to (5,5), that wasn't an apple. Wait, no\u2014the initial problem's apple list didn't include (5,5). Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem states: Apples at: (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). So (5,5) wasn't an apple. Wait, but in the last move information, the user said \"Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (5,5)\" and the board state shows an 'A' at (5,5) in row 5. Wait, looking at the board state:\n\nThe board state shows row 5 as \"A . . . . 1 . . . .\", which is y=5. So (5,5) is where the snake is, and there's an 'A' at (0,5) (x=0, y=5). Wait, no\u2014the row 5 in the board is y=5. The columns are x from 0 to 9. So row 5 (y=5) has an 'A' at x=0 (0,5), then the snake at x=5 (5,5). So the apple at (0,5) is still present. So in the previous move, moving DOWN to (5,5) didn't eat an apple because there was no apple there. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nOriginal problem's apples are at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). The board state shows:\n\nRow 5 (y=5): A . . . . 1 . . . . \n\nSo at (0,5) (x=0, y=5) there's an 'A', and the snake is at (5,5). So in the last move, the snake was at (5,6) after moving DOWN from (5,7). Then the user's last move was DOWN to (5,5), which is the current position. But (5,5) wasn't an apple. So that move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the apples are still at the original positions. So the current apples are (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). \n\nSo now, the snake is at (5,5). Possible moves: UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5). \n\nNeed to check which directions are safe. The snake's body after moving to (5,5) would have the previous position at (5,6) as part of the body. So moving UP back to (5,6) would collide with its own body, which is a death. So UP is invalid. \n\nSo possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nLooking for apples nearby. The closest apples are (0,5) (same y, x=0), (6,6) (x=6, y=6), (3,7) (x=3, y=7), (2,7) (x=2, y=7), and (9,0) (x=9, y=0). \n\nFrom (5,5), moving LEFT towards (0,5) would require moving left multiple times. But moving LEFT once to (4,5) doesn't reach an apple. The apple at (0,5) is 5 steps left. Moving RIGHT to (6,5) is one step, but the apple at (6,6) is one step up from (6,5). So if I move RIGHT to (6,5), then next move UP to (6,6) would get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) doesn't lead to an apple immediately. The apple at (9,0) is far. \n\nAnother option: moving LEFT to (4,5), then continue left towards (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) to eat the apple there. That seems more efficient. \n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. The enemy snake #2 is at (6,9) with body at []. So they are at (6,9), which is far from (6,5). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. \n\nSo the plan: move RIGHT to (6,5), then next turn move UP to (6,6) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT towards (0,5) but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's position. If snake #2 is at (6,9), they might be moving down towards the apples. But they are far away. \n\nSo the best immediate move is RIGHT to (6,5), setting up to get the apple at (6,6) next. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards (0,5), but that's a longer path and might not be as efficient. \n\nSo the optimal move is RIGHT to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) next turn. \n\nCheck for safety: moving RIGHT to (6,5) is within the board (x=6 is valid). No snakes are there. The enemy is at (6,9), so no collision. \n\nTherefore, the direction should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** Move UP to (6,6) to eat the apple there.  \n**Direction:** RIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (7,9) with no body segments, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, check possible moves from (6,5). The options are UP to (6,6), DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5), or RIGHT to (7,5). \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,6) directly above. Moving UP to (6,6) would eat that apple, which is great for points. But need to ensure that path is safe. \n\nCheck if (6,6) is a valid move. The board shows an 'A' there, so it's an apple. Moving into it is safe and beneficial. However, after eating, the snake's body would grow. But since the enemy snake is at (7,9), which is far away, there's no immediate collision threat there. \n\nOther directions: Moving RIGHT to (7,5) would take me closer to the enemy's position at (7,9), but they're still four steps up. Not an immediate threat. Moving LEFT to (5,5) would retrace the previous step, but since the snake's body hasn't grown yet (assuming it didn't eat an apple in the last move), that's safe. Wait, the last move was RIGHT to (6,5), so the previous position was (5,5). If the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, then the body is only the current head. So moving LEFT back to (5,5) would not collide with itself. \n\nBut the goal is to maximize points. The apple at (6,6) is the closest. So moving UP is the best option. \n\nCheck for walls: (6,6) is within the 10x10 grid. No walls there. No other snakes in that spot. So moving UP is safe and gets the apple. \n\nAlternative options: If I move RIGHT to (7,5), then next move could be towards (9,0), but that's a longer path.

But since the snake was at (6,5) and moves to (6,6), the body would now be [(6,5)]. So next turn, moving back to (6,5) would collide with the body. Therefore, next turn, avoid moving DOWN to (6,5). \n\nBut for this current move, moving UP is safe and beneficial.

Wait, the initial list had (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), but in the last move, I ate the apple at (6,6), so that one's gone now. Wait, no, the current board state shows apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8). Wait, the user's initial message might have a typo. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nAt y=5, there's an A at (0,5). At y=0, there's an A at (9,0). At y=7, there are A's at (2,7) and (3,7). At y=8, there's an A at (3,8). So the apples are at those positions. The snake is at (6,6) now. The enemy snake is at (8,9) with body at [], so just the head.\n\nPossible moves from (6,6): UP to (6,7), DOWN to (6,5), LEFT to (5,6), RIGHT to (7,6).\n\nBut after moving UP last turn, the snake's body would now include (6,5) as the tail. So moving DOWN to (6,5) would collide with the body. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo available directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, check which direction leads to an apple. The closest apples are at (2,7) and (3,7), which are to the left and up. From (6,6), moving LEFT would decrease x, moving towards (2,7). But that's a distance of 4 in x and 1 in y. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,7) would get closer to (3,7) and (3,8), but those are still 3 units left and 1 up. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (7,6) might lead towards (9,0), but that's far. The apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. Moving right would take me towards x=9, but y=0 is way down. Maybe not the best path.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,9). That's the top right corner. They might be going for the apple at (9,0) as well, but they're far away. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best options are either UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\nUP to (6,7): This is safe. Then next move could go further up or left towards the apples at (3,7) or (2,7). From (6,7), moving left would start heading towards those apples.\n\nLEFT to (5,6): Moving left once, then again towards (4,6), etc. But the apples are at higher y coordinates (7 and 8). So moving left might not get me closer to the apples quickly.\n\nRIGHT to (7,6): Moving towards the enemy's area, but not sure. Maybe there's an apple at (9,0) but that's a long way down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,8) is reachable by going up and left. Let's see: from (6,6), moving UP to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a few moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (5,6), then UP to (5,7), then LEFT again.\n\nBut the immediate move: which direction is safest and leads towards apples. The apple at (3,7) is at (3,7), so from (6,6), moving left three times and up once. So moving LEFT and UP would be the path.\n\nBut the first step could be LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. Alternatively, moving UP first to (6,7), then LEFT.\n\nWhich is better? Maybe moving UP first to get closer to the y-coordinate of the apples. Let's check if (6,7) is safe. The enemy is at (8,9), so no collision there. No other snakes. So moving UP is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,6) is also safe. But which path is more efficient? Maybe UP then LEFT, but need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving UP to (6,7), the next move could be LEFT, but then the body would be at (6,6) and (6,5). So the snake's body is growing, so need to plan the path to not loop around and collide.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,6) would start heading west, which might have more space. But the apples are in the northwest. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (7,6) to go towards the apple at (9,0). But that's a long path. From (7,6), moving down to (7,5), then right to (8,5), etc. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's see: moving UP to (6,7) gets me closer to the apples at (3,7) and (2,7). Then next move could be LEFT towards them. Alternatively, moving LEFT first.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any immediate danger. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is far away. So no immediate threat.\n\nSo the best move is to head towards the apples. Either UP or LEFT. Let's pick UP to (6,7) to get closer to the apples in the upper rows. Then next moves can be LEFT towards them.\n\nSo direction: UP.\n\nWait, but moving UP from (6,6) to (6,7) is allowed. Then next turn, the body would be at (6,6) and (6,5). So next move can't go DOWN to (6,6), but can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,6) would start moving west, which might be safer in terms of space. But the apples are in the upper left. So moving UP first seems better.\n\nYes, I think moving UP is the best choice here to approach the apples at (2,7) and (3,7).\n</think>\n\nUP  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** Continue moving towards the apples in the northwest while avoiding self-collision.  \n**Direction:** UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (5,7). The apples are at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6). The enemy snake is at (4,9) with an empty body. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to move. The possible moves from (5,7) are UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), or RIGHT to (6,7). \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5) which is two steps down from me, (2,7) which is three steps left, and (6,6) which is one step right and one down. Wait, (6,6) is actually diagonally down-right from (5,7). So to get there, I need to move right to (6,7) then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which isn't an apple. Hmm. Alternatively, if I go down first to (5,6), then right to (6,6), but that's two moves. But maybe the apple at (6,6) is a good target. \n\nBut there's also the apple at (2,7) which is three steps left. So moving left three times from (5,7) would get me there. But moving left three times would require checking if there's any obstacles. The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away. So the path to (2,7) is clear? Let me check the board state again. The board shows at row 7 (y=7), the snake is at (5,7), and there's an apple at (2,7). So from (5,7) moving left three times would reach (2,7). But each move left would be to (4,7), (3,7), (2,7). Are there any snakes in that path? The enemy snake is at (4,9), which is two rows up. So (4,7) is safe. So that path is clear. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down twice. But moving down once to (5,6) would get me closer. But (5,6) is not an apple. Wait, the apples listed include (5,5), which is two steps down. So moving down twice would get me there. But maybe that's a longer path. \n\nAlso, the apple at (6,6) is one step right and one down. So moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6). But moving right first would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to get the apple. But that's two moves. But maybe that's a good path. \n\nBut I need to choose the next immediate direction. So which direction now gives me the best path towards an apple without danger. Let's check possible dangers. \n\nIf I move UP to (5,8), that's empty. Then next move could be towards an apple. But there's no apple in that direction immediately. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,6), then next move could be down again to (5,5) to get the apple. That's two moves. But moving down now would take me closer. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7), then next left to (3,7), then (2,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. But each step left is safe. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,7), then next down to (6,6) to get the apple. That's two moves. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Going left towards (2,7) takes three moves but gets an apple. \n- Going down towards (5,5) takes two moves. \n- Going right then down to (6,6) takes two moves. \n\nWhich is the shortest path? The apple at (6,6) is two moves away (right then down), but the apple at (5,5) is two moves down. The apple at (2,7) is three moves left. \n\nBut the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Let's count the steps. From (5,7):\n\nTo (6,6): right then down. Two steps. \n\nTo (5,5): down twice. Two steps. \n\nTo (2,7): left three steps. \n\nSo the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. But (5,5) is directly down, while (6,6) requires right then down. \n\nBut which direction should I choose first? Let's think about possible collisions. \n\nIf I move down now to (5,6), then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. That's safe. But what's at (5,6)? The board shows that row 6 (y=6) has an apple at (6,6). So (5,6) is empty. So moving down to (5,6) is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) which is an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nBut moving right first: (6,7) is empty. Then next move down to (6,6) which is an apple. \n\nSo both paths are possible. \n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for other snakes. The enemy snake is at (4,9). So their head is at (4,9). They might be moving around, but since their body is empty, they can't block me immediately. \n\nSo both paths seem safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) would take longer, but maybe that's a less contested apple. \n\nBut since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe going for the closest ones first. \n\nSo between (5,5) and (6,6), which is better? \n\nIf I go down now, I can get to (5,5) in two moves. But moving down now would take me to (5,6), which is safe. Then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right now to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to get that apple. \n\nWhich path is better? Let's see. \n\nIf I go down now, then next move down again. But after eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow. Then I need to plan the next move. \n\nAlternatively, moving right then down. \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (6,6) is in the same row as the enemy snake's position (4,9) is in row 9. So maybe that area is less contested. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (5,5) is closer. \n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly below me. So moving down twice. \n\nBut maybe the enemy snake could also be heading towards that apple. But since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,6) is near another apple at (5,5). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (2,7) could be a longer path, but maybe there's less competition. \n\nBut since the enemy is at (4,9), which is far from (2,7), maybe that's a safer apple. \n\nBut I need to choose the next direction. \n\nSo possible options:\n\n1. Move DOWN towards (5,5). \n\n2. Move RIGHT towards (6,6). \n\n3. Move LEFT towards (2,7). \n\n4. Move UP, but that's away from apples. \n\nMoving UP would take me to (5,8), which is empty. But there's no apple in that direction. So probably not the best choice. \n\nSo between DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT. \n\nWhich is the best first move? \n\nIf I choose DOWN now, then next move is DOWN again. But after that, I'll have to find another apple. \n\nIf I choose RIGHT now, then next move is DOWN to get the apple. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, then next moves are LEFT again. \n\nBut considering the number of steps, the apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps away. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (6,6) is better because after eating it, I can then move towards other apples. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (5,5), I can go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nBut (0,5) is to the left, and (9,0) is far to the right and down. \n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) by moving right and down. \n\nBut maybe the path to (6,6) is better. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6) and then down to (5,5) gives me an apple. \n\nBut what's the risk? Are there any obstacles in those positions? \n\nThe board shows that (5,6) is empty. (5,5) is an apple. \n\nSo moving down is safe. \n\nSimilarly, moving right to (6,7) is safe. \n\nSo both options are safe. \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, the snake grows. So the body will extend. But since the snake's body is only the head right now (since the last move was None, implying it's the start?), then after eating an apple, the body will be longer. \n\nWait, the snake's current position is (5,7). The body is just the head. So moving to an apple will make the body length 2. \n\nSo after eating an apple, the next move will have to avoid running into the body. \n\nBut since the body is just the previous position, which is (5,7) if I move down to (5,6), then the next move can't go back to (5,7). \n\nBut that's standard snake behavior. \n\nSo, perhaps the best first move is to go for the closest apple. \n\nBut which is closer? (5,5) is two steps down, (6,6) is two steps (right then down), (2,7) is three steps left. \n\nSo (5,5) and (6,6) are both two steps. \n\nBut (5,5) is directly down, so moving down twice. \n\nAlternatively, (6,6) requires moving right then down. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then proceed towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then maybe go towards (0,5) or (9,0). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as my current position. So moving left three times would get me there. But that's three moves. \n\nBut perhaps that's a longer path, but maybe safer. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake is at (4,9), which is far away, maybe the path is safe. \n\nBut I need to choose the first move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to go for the apple that's in the same row, (2,7). So moving left three times. \n\nBut that's three moves. But maybe after getting that apple, I can go down towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nBut is that the best option? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, (5,7) to (6,6) is one step right and one down. So Manhattan distance is 2. Same as (5,5). \n\nBut the path to (6,6) requires moving right first. \n\nBut moving right now would take me to (6,7), which is safe. Then next move down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down now to (5,6), then down to (5,5). \n\nSo both options are two steps. \n\nBut which path is better? \n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple, where can I go next. \n\nIf I go to (5,5), then I can move left towards (0,5) or right towards (6,6) again. \n\nIf I go to (6,6), then I can move towards (9,0) or other apples. \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), etc., towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo maybe going for (5,5) first allows me to then go towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), I can go towards (9,0) but that's a long path. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is better because it's in a less crowded area. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a central location, making it easier to reach other apples. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest first move is to go down towards (5,5). \n\nBecause moving down now to (5,6) is safe, and then next move down to (5,5) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,7) is safe, then down to (6,6). \n\nBut which is better? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer to other apples. For example, after getting (6,6), I can go to (9,0) or (5,5). \n\nBut (9,0) is far. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), moving left to (5,6) then down to (5,5). \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, after (5,5), moving left towards (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) allows me to collect two apples in sequence: (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is to go down. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving down first towards (5,5) is a good choice. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,5) is two steps down. So moving down now to (5,6), then down again to (5,5). \n\nBut after that, the snake's body would be at (5,7) and (5,6), so the next move can't go back up. \n\nBut after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the body would be (5,7) and (5,6), and the new head at (5,5). \n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So when you move into the apple, you add a segment. \n\nSo if the snake is at (5,7), and moves down to (5,6), which is not an apple. Then next move down to (5,5), which is an apple. So after moving into (5,5), the snake's body would be (5,6) and (5,7), and the head at (5,5). So the length is 3. \n\nBut the initial length is 1. So moving to (5,6) (no apple) makes the body length 2. Then moving to (5,5) (apple) makes the body length 3. \n\nSo after eating the apple, the snake's body is (5,6), (5,7), and head at (5,5). \n\nSo the next move after that would have to avoid going back to (5,6). \n\nBut that's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, if I go right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) (apple). Then the body would be (5,7), (6,7), and head at (6,6). So length 3. \n\nSo both paths result in the same length. \n\nBut which path allows for more future moves? \n\nAfter getting (5,5), the snake can move left towards (0,5), which is another apple. \n\nBut (0,5) is five steps left from (5,5). \n\nAlternatively, after getting (6,6), the snake can move towards (9,0), which is three steps right and six steps down. \n\nBut that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, after (6,6), the snake can move left to (5,6), then down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's possible. \n\nSo maybe going for (6,6) first allows me to collect two apples in sequence. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is more central, allowing access to other apples. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go right first towards (6,6), as that apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut maybe moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first allows me to collect (5,5) and then (0,5). \n\nBut (0,5) is an apple. \n\nSo perhaps the path to (5,5) is better because it leads to another apple. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,9). They might be moving towards the apples as well. \n\nThe apples at (5,5) and (6,6) are both in the middle of the board. The enemy is at (4,9), which is top-left. So maybe they are closer to (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nBut the enemy's position is (4,9). To get to (5,5), they need to move down four steps and right one. To get to (6,6), they need to move down three steps and right two. \n\nSo maybe the enemy is more likely to go towards (5,5) than (6,6). \n\nIf that's the case, then maybe I should go for (6,6) to avoid competition. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy is moving towards (5,5), then I might want to get there first. \n\nBut since the enemy's body is empty, they are just starting. So their next move could be any direction. \n\nBut without knowing their direction, it's hard to predict. \n\nIn that case, perhaps the safest move is to go for the closest apple that's less likely to be contested. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,7) is in the same row as me, and the enemy is far away. So moving left three times to get it. \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nBut maybe that's a safer option. \n\nBut the first move would be LEFT. \n\nSo, considering all possibilities, I think the best initial move is to go DOWN towards (5,5). \n\nBecause it's a direct path, and after collecting that apple, I can head towards (0,5). \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,7) then down to (6,6) is also good. \n\nBut I need to choose one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is closer in terms of steps. Wait, no. Both are two steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving right first allows me to collect (6,6) and then (5,5) in a different path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down first. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (6,6) is in a position that's easier to reach other apples from. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,5) is in a more central location, making it easier to navigate to other apples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go RIGHT first. \n\nBecause moving right to (6,7) and then down to (6,6) to get the apple. \n\nThen, after that, I can move left to (5,6) and down to (5,5) to get that apple. \n\nBut that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to go for the apple that's directly below me. \n\nSo, after considering all options, I think moving DOWN is the best first move. \n\nSo the next direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After moving down to (5,6), plan to go down again to (5,5) to eat the apple. Then consider heading left towards (0,5) while avoiding collisions.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

The apples are still at (5,5), (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), and (6,6). The enemy snake #2 is at (5,9) with an empty body.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6) are UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), or RIGHT to (6,6). \n\nFirst, check for immediate apples. Moving DOWN to (5,5) would directly eat the apple there, which is great. That would grow my snake and give me a point. Moving RIGHT to (6,6) also leads to an apple. Both are valid options. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,5), that's the quickest way to get an apple. After eating it, my body would extend, so the next move can't go back up to (5,6).

Then my body would be (5,6) and (5,7) from before. Wait, no. Let me clarify the body positions. \n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,6) in the last move, the snake's body is now at (5,6) and the previous position (5,7) is part of the body. So if I move RIGHT to (6,6), the new head is at (6,6), and the body becomes (5,6) and (5,7). But since I ate an apple, the body grows by one, so the tail stays. Wait, the rules might differ, but typically, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a segment. So after moving into (6,6), the body would be (5,6) and the new head at (6,6), with the tail remaining at (5,7) if not moved. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here. \n\nBut the main point is, moving DOWN to (5,5) gives an immediate apple, and moving RIGHT to (6,6) also does. Both are valid. \n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (5,5) is a straight path and avoids potential conflicts. The enemy is at (5,9), so they might be moving down towards (5,5) as well. But since they're at (5,9), they need four moves down to reach (5,5). I can get there in one move. So I should prioritize that. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) is also safe. But which apple is more strategic? (5,5) is central, allowing access to other apples like (0,5) or (2,7). (6,6) is closer to (9,0), but that's a longer path. \n\nConsidering efficiency, moving DOWN to (5,5) is better. It's a direct path, and after eating, I can plan to move left towards (0,5) or other apples. \n\nAnother consideration: if I move DOWN to (5,5), the next move can't be UP back to (5,6) because that's my body. So after eating, I need to choose LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But (5,5) is at the bottom edge (y=5), so moving DOWN would go to (5,4), which is safe. \n\nIn conclusion, moving DOWN to (5,5) secures an apple immediately and positions me to plan the next move towards other apples. It's the safest and most efficient choice.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** After eating the apple at (5,5), consider moving LEFT towards (0,5) while avoiding the body.  \n**Direction:** DOWN"

Wait, no\u2014the initial apples were (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). But when I moved DOWN to (5,5), that apple was eaten, so now the remaining apples are (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7) minus (5,5). Wait, no\u2014the initial list in the problem statement says apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). Wait, but in the previous move, the user mentioned that after moving DOWN to (5,6), the apples were at (5,5), but that might have been a typo. Wait, the original problem states apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). So when I moved DOWN to (5,5), that wasn't an apple. Wait, no\u2014the initial problem's apple list didn't include (5,5). Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem states: Apples at: (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). So (5,5) wasn't an apple. Wait, but in the last move information, the user said \"Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (5,5)\" and the board state shows an 'A' at (5,5) in row 5. Wait, looking at the board state:\n\nThe board state shows row 5 as \"A . . . . 1 . . . .\", which is y=5. So (5,5) is where the snake is, and there's an 'A' at (0,5) (x=0, y=5). Wait, no\u2014the row 5 in the board is y=5. The columns are x from 0 to 9. So row 5 (y=5) has an 'A' at x=0 (0,5), then the snake at x=5 (5,5). So the apple at (0,5) is still present. So in the previous move, moving DOWN to (5,5) didn't eat an apple because there was no apple there. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nOriginal problem's apples are at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). The board state shows:\n\nRow 5 (y=5): A . . . . 1 . . . . \n\nSo at (0,5) (x=0, y=5) there's an 'A', and the snake is at (5,5). So in the last move, the snake was at (5,6) after moving DOWN from (5,7). Then the user's last move was DOWN to (5,5), which is the current position. But (5,5) wasn't an apple. So that move didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the apples are still at the original positions. So the current apples are (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (6,6), (3,7). \n\nSo now, the snake is at (5,5). Possible moves: UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5). \n\nNeed to check which directions are safe. The snake's body after moving to (5,5) would have the previous position at (5,6) as part of the body. So moving UP back to (5,6) would collide with its own body, which is a death. So UP is invalid. \n\nSo possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nLooking for apples nearby. The closest apples are (0,5) (same y, x=0), (6,6) (x=6, y=6), (3,7) (x=3, y=7), (2,7) (x=2, y=7), and (9,0) (x=9, y=0). \n\nFrom (5,5), moving LEFT towards (0,5) would require moving left multiple times. But moving LEFT once to (4,5) doesn't reach an apple. The apple at (0,5) is 5 steps left. Moving RIGHT to (6,5) is one step, but the apple at (6,6) is one step up from (6,5). So if I move RIGHT to (6,5), then next move UP to (6,6) would get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) doesn't lead to an apple immediately. The apple at (9,0) is far. \n\nAnother option: moving LEFT to (4,5), then continue left towards (0,5). But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) to eat the apple there. That seems more efficient. \n\nBut need to check if moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. The enemy snake #2 is at (6,9) with body at []. So they are at (6,9), which is far from (6,5). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. \n\nSo the plan: move RIGHT to (6,5), then next turn move UP to (6,6) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT towards (0,5) but that's a longer path. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's position. If snake #2 is at (6,9), they might be moving down towards the apples. But they are far away. \n\nSo the best immediate move is RIGHT to (6,5), setting up to get the apple at (6,6) next. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) to start heading towards (0,5), but that's a longer path and might not be as efficient. \n\nSo the optimal move is RIGHT to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) next turn. \n\nCheck for safety: moving RIGHT to (6,5) is within the board (x=6 is valid). No snakes are there. The enemy is at (6,9), so no collision. \n\nTherefore, the direction should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** Move UP to (6,6) to eat the apple there.  \n**Direction:** RIGHT"

The enemy snake is at (7,9) with no body segments, so it's just the head.\n\nFirst, check possible moves from (6,5). The options are UP to (6,6), DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5), or RIGHT to (7,5). \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,6) directly above. Moving UP to (6,6) would eat that apple, which is great for points. But need to ensure that path is safe. \n\nCheck if (6,6) is a valid move. The board shows an 'A' there, so it's an apple. Moving into it is safe and beneficial. However, after eating, the snake's body would grow. But since the enemy snake is at (7,9), which is far away, there's no immediate collision threat there. \n\nOther directions: Moving RIGHT to (7,5) would take me closer to the enemy's position at (7,9), but they're still four steps up. Not an immediate threat. Moving LEFT to (5,5) would retrace the previous step, but since the snake's body hasn't grown yet (assuming it didn't eat an apple in the last move), that's safe. Wait, the last move was RIGHT to (6,5), so the previous position was (5,5). If the snake didn't eat an apple in the last move, then the body is only the current head. So moving LEFT back to (5,5) would not collide with itself. \n\nBut the goal is to maximize points. The apple at (6,6) is the closest. So moving UP is the best option. \n\nCheck for walls: (6,6) is within the 10x10 grid. No walls there. No other snakes in that spot. So moving UP is safe and gets the apple. \n\nAlternative options: If I move RIGHT to (7,5), then next move could be towards (9,0), but that's a longer path. Moving DOWN or LEFT doesn't lead to apples immediately. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is UP to (6,6) to eat the apple and gain a point. \n\nNext turn's strategy: After eating the apple, the snake's body will grow. Need to plan the next move carefully to avoid self-collision. From (6,6), possible moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but need to avoid moving back to (6,5) if the body is there. But since the snake just ate the apple, the body would extend, so the tail would stay in place. Wait, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, the body grows by one segment. So after moving to (6,6), the body would include (6,5) and the previous positions. So next move can't go back to (6,5) if the body is there. But since the snake was at (6,5) and moves to (6,6), the body would now be [(6,5)]. So next turn, moving back to (6,5) would collide with the body. Therefore, next turn, avoid moving DOWN to (6,5). \n\nBut for this current move, moving UP is safe and beneficial. So the decision is to move UP.\n</think>\n\nUP  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** Avoid moving back DOWN to (6,5) to prevent self-collision.  \n**Direction:** UP"

Wait, the initial list had (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), but in the last move, I ate the apple at (6,6), so that one's gone now. Wait, no, the current board state shows apples at (0,5), (9,0), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8). Wait, the user's initial message might have a typo. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n\nAt y=5, there's an A at (0,5). At y=0, there's an A at (9,0). At y=7, there are A's at (2,7) and (3,7). At y=8, there's an A at (3,8). So the apples are at those positions. The snake is at (6,6) now. The enemy snake is at (8,9) with body at [], so just the head.\n\nPossible moves from (6,6): UP to (6,7), DOWN to (6,5), LEFT to (5,6), RIGHT to (7,6).\n\nBut after moving UP last turn, the snake's body would now include (6,5) as the tail. So moving DOWN to (6,5) would collide with the body. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo available directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, check which direction leads to an apple. The closest apples are at (2,7) and (3,7), which are to the left and up. From (6,6), moving LEFT would decrease x, moving towards (2,7). But that's a distance of 4 in x and 1 in y. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,7) would get closer to (3,7) and (3,8), but those are still 3 units left and 1 up. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (7,6) might lead towards (9,0), but that's far. The apple at (9,0) is at the bottom right corner. Moving right would take me towards x=9, but y=0 is way down. Maybe not the best path.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,9). That's the top right corner. They might be going for the apple at (9,0) as well, but they're far away. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSo the best options are either UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\nUP to (6,7): This is safe. Then next move could go further up or left towards the apples at (3,7) or (2,7). From (6,7), moving left would start heading towards those apples.\n\nLEFT to (5,6): Moving left once, then again towards (4,6), etc. But the apples are at higher y coordinates (7 and 8). So moving left might not get me closer to the apples quickly.\n\nRIGHT to (7,6): Moving towards the enemy's area, but not sure. Maybe there's an apple at (9,0) but that's a long way down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,8) is reachable by going up and left. Let's see: from (6,6), moving UP to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a few moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT first to (5,6), then UP to (5,7), then LEFT again.\n\nBut the immediate move: which direction is safest and leads towards apples. The apple at (3,7) is at (3,7), so from (6,6), moving left three times and up once. So moving LEFT and UP would be the path.\n\nBut the first step could be LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. Alternatively, moving UP first to (6,7), then LEFT.\n\nWhich is better? Maybe moving UP first to get closer to the y-coordinate of the apples. Let's check if (6,7) is safe. The enemy is at (8,9), so no collision there. No other snakes. So moving UP is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,6) is also safe. But which path is more efficient? Maybe UP then LEFT, but need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving UP to (6,7), the next move could be LEFT, but then the body would be at (6,6) and (6,5). So the snake's body is growing, so need to plan the path to not loop around and collide.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,6) would start heading west, which might have more space. But the apples are in the northwest. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (7,6) to go towards the apple at (9,0). But that's a long path. From (7,6), moving down to (7,5), then right to (8,5), etc. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's see: moving UP to (6,7) gets me closer to the apples at (3,7) and (2,7). Then next move could be LEFT towards them. Alternatively, moving LEFT first.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any immediate danger. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is far away. So no immediate threat.\n\nSo the best move is to head towards the apples. Either UP or LEFT. Let's pick UP to (6,7) to get closer to the apples in the upper rows. Then next moves can be LEFT towards them.\n\nSo direction: UP.\n\nWait, but moving UP from (6,6) to (6,7) is allowed. Then next turn, the body would be at (6,6) and (6,5). So next move can't go DOWN to (6,6), but can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,6) would start moving west, which might be safer in terms of space. But the apples are in the upper left. So moving UP first seems better.\n\nYes, I think moving UP is the best choice here to approach the apples at (2,7) and (3,7).\n</think>\n\nUP  \n**Next Turn Strategy:** Continue moving towards the apples in the northwest while avoiding self-collision.  \n**Direction:** UP"
