This direction seems promising as it positions the snake towards a nearby apple while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake at (7,9).\n- **DOWN (6,3):** Heads towards the apple at (1,3), but it's a longer path and might require navigating around the board edges.\n- **LEFT (5,4):** Opens up potential paths towards multiple apples but doesn't immediately lead to any specific apple.\n- **RIGHT (7,4):** Seems safe initially but doesn't bring the snake closer to any apple and moves closer to the enemy snake's vicinity at (7,9).\n\n**Strategy:**\nPrioritize moving towards the nearest apple to maximize point gains while maintaining a safe distance from enemy snakes. Additionally, plan future moves to navigate efficiently towards other apples without risking collisions.\n\n**Decided next move:** **UP**"

My snake is currently at position (7, 9), and the enemy snake is at position (6, 4).\n\nGiven that my snake is located at the top-right corner of the board, my best strategy would be to move towards the apples located in the center and upper-left parts of the board. This will allow me to gain points while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls.\n\nAdditionally, I should be cautious of the enemy snake's position and avoid getting too close to it, as a collision would result in my death.\n\nMy next move will be UP to position (7, 8). This will position me closer to the apples at (4, 9) and (3, 8), while also keeping me away from the enemy snake.\n\nUP"
