            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,5). There are apples at (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,9): Column 3, Row 9\n\n- (8,4): Column 8, Row 4\n\n- (9,0): Column 9, Row 0\n\n- (4,8): Column 4, Row 8\n\n- (0,2): Column 0, Row 2\n\nMy position is (2,5): Column 2, Row 5\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (0,4): Column 0, Row 4\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- Up: (2,6)\n\n- Down: (2,4)\n\n- Left: (1,5)\n\n- Right: (3,5)\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\nSince it's the start, and the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts, I don't need to worry about its body yet. But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |2-3| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |2-8| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |2-4| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |2-0| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, apples at (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2) are all 5 steps away, while the others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\nUp: (2,6)\n\n- Not immediately dangerous.\n\nDown: (2,4)\n\n- Close to enemy snake at (0,4). Need to see if it's safe.\n\nLeft: (1,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nRight: (3,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nI should also consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (3,9) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (4,8) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (0,2) is down and to the left.\n\nSo, to reach (3,9) or (4,8), moving up would be a good start.\n\nMoving down towards (0,2) could bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,4), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy snake at (0,4). Not sure what it will do, but it's better to avoid being in its row.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any particular apple immediately, but it might set me up for a path towards one.\n\nWait, but I need a strategy to maximize points by eating apples without dying.\n\nPerhaps I should consider a path that allows me to eat the closest apple without risking collision.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (3,9).\n\nTo get from (2,5) to (3,9), I need to move right once and up four times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nFirst move: right to (3,5)\n\nThen up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,8): right twice and up three times.\n\nOr for (0,2): left twice and down three times.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (0,4), moving down might bring me closer to it.\n\nPerhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is farther, but maybe worth considering.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is way far away, at the bottom right corner. That might not be the best priority right now.\n\nSo, focusing on (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2), all at a distance of 5.\n\nI need to choose which one to go for first.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (3,9): up and right\n\n- (4,8): up and right\n\n- (0,2): down and left\n\nGiven that the enemy is on the left and down, perhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) would be safer, away from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, moving up and right might give me more space to maneuver.\n\nSo, perhaps moving towards (3,9) or (4,8).\n\nLet me think about the immediate next move.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving right to (3,5) seems like a good start towards both (3,9) and (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) also moves me closer to both.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the Manhattan distance to (3,9) from both (3,5) and (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,9): 4 steps up.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,9): right once, up three times.\n\nSo, both are similar in terms of steps.\n\nBut moving right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any other apples, while moving up to (2,6) also brings me closer to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (2,6) to (4,8): right twice, up two times.\n\nSo, moving up might be more versatile.\n\nAlso, moving up to (2,6) doesn't put me in the same row as the enemy, whereas moving right to (3,5) keeps me on row 5, away from the enemy.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy is at (0,4), and it's snake 1, I don't know its behavior yet.\n\nPerhaps it will move towards the nearest apple, or towards me.\n\nTo be safe, I should assume it might move towards me.\n\nSo, if I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy at (0,4).\n\nThat might be risky.\n\nTherefore, maybe staying on row 5 or moving up is safer.\n\nMoreover, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) both keep me on row 5.\n\nFrom there, I can decide to move up later.\n\nBut, I need to make progress towards an apple.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,9), moving right to (3,5) and then up is a direct path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) and then right would also work.\n\nI think moving right to (3,5) is fine.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nCurrently, the board shows no other snakes or apples blocking (3,5).\n\nSo, moving right to (3,5) is safe.\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up to (2,6) and then right.\n\nBut, perhaps moving right first is fine.\n\nAlright, so my plan is to move right to (3,5), then up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,"

Coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . 1 . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,9): Column 3, Row 9\n\n- (8,4): Column 8, Row 4\n\n- (9,0): Column 9, Row 0\n\n- (4,8): Column 4, Row 8\n\n- (0,2): Column 0, Row 2\n\nMy position is (2,6): Column 2, Row 6\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (1,4): Column 1, Row 4\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (2,6):\n\n- Up: (2,7)\n\n- Down: (2,5)\n\n- Left: (1,6)\n\n- Right: (3,6)\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\nSince it's early in the game, and the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts yet, I don't need to worry about its body. But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |2-3| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |2-8| + |6-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |2-9| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |2-4| + |6-8| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |2-0| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, apples at (3,9) and (4,8) are closest, both at a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\n- Up: (2,7)\n\n- Not immediately dangerous, and moves me closer to (3,9) and (4,8).\n\n- Down: (2,5)\n\n- Moves me away from the closest apples and closer to the enemy snake at (1,4).\n\n- Left: (1,6)\n\n- Moves me closer to the enemy snake at (1,4).\n\n- Right: (3,6)\n\n- Moves me closer to (3,9) and (4,8).\n\nGiven this, moving up or right seems like the best options.\n\nLet me think about moving up to (2,7):\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9) or (4,8). However, I need to consider if the path is clear.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (3,6):\n\nFrom there, I can move up towards (3,9) or continue right towards (4,8).\n\nBoth seem viable, but moving right to (3,6) might be slightly better because it directly aligns me with the apple at (3,9).\n\nMoreover, moving up from (2,6) to (2,7) doesn't bring me directly towards any apple; I'd need to decide whether to go left or right from there.\n\nOn the other hand, moving right to (3,6) puts me in a position where I can directly move up to (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9) to eat the apple at (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I choose to go for (4,8), moving right to (3,6), then up to (3,7), (3,8), and then right to (4,8).\n\nComparatively, moving up to (2,7) and then right to (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9) for the apple at (3,9), or right to (4,7), (4,8) for the apple at (4,8).\n\nIt seems that moving right to (3,6) is a more direct path to both closest apples.\n\nAdditionally, moving right avoids the area where the enemy snake is located at (1,4).\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (1,4), it could move up towards me, or left, or down.\n\nBut since I'm at (2,6), moving right to (3,6) puts some distance between us.\n\nWhereas moving up to (2,7) keeps me in the same column as the enemy, which might be riskier if it decides to move up.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (3,6) seems like a safer and more strategic move for now.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can then plan to move up towards (3,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements in subsequent turns to adjust my path if necessary.\n\nSo, for this turn, I decide to move right to (3,6).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There are apples at (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,9): Column 3, Row 9\n\n- (8,4): Column 8, Row 4\n\n- (9,0): Column 9, Row 0\n\n- (4,8): Column 4, Row 8\n\n- (0,2): Column 0, Row 2\n\nMy position is (2,5): Column 2, Row 5\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (0,4): Column 0, Row 4\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- Up: (2,6)\n\n- Down: (2,4)\n\n- Left: (1,5)\n\n- Right: (3,5)\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\nSince it's the start, and the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts, I don't need to worry about its body yet. But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |2-3| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |2-8| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |2-4| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |2-0| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, apples at (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2) are all 5 steps away, while the others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\nUp: (2,6)\n\n- Not immediately dangerous.\n\nDown: (2,4)\n\n- Close to enemy snake at (0,4). Need to see if it's safe.\n\nLeft: (1,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nRight: (3,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nI should also consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (3,9) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (4,8) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (0,2) is down and to the left.\n\nSo, to reach (3,9) or (4,8), moving up would be a good start.\n\nMoving down towards (0,2) could bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,4), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy snake at (0,4). Not sure what it will do, but it's better to avoid being in its row.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any particular apple immediately, but it might set me up for a path towards one.\n\nWait, but I need a strategy to maximize points by eating apples without dying.\n\nPerhaps I should consider a path that allows me to eat the closest apple without risking collision.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (3,9).\n\nTo get from (2,5) to (3,9), I need to move right once and up four times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nFirst move: right to (3,5)\n\nThen up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,8): right twice and up three times.\n\nOr for (0,2): left twice and down three times.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (0,4), moving down might bring me closer to it.\n\nPerhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is farther, but maybe worth considering.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is way far away, at the bottom right corner. That might not be the best priority right now.\n\nSo, focusing on (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2), all at a distance of 5.\n\nI need to choose which one to go for first.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (3,9): up and right\n\n- (4,8): up and right\n\n- (0,2): down and left\n\nGiven that the enemy is on the left and down, perhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) would be safer, away from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, moving up and right might give me more space to maneuver.\n\nSo, perhaps moving towards (3,9) or (4,8).\n\nLet me think about the immediate next move.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving right to (3,5) seems like a good start towards both (3,9) and (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) also moves me closer to both.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the Manhattan distance to (3,9) from both (3,5) and (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,9): 4 steps up.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,9): right once, up three times.\n\nSo, both are similar in terms of steps.\n\nBut moving right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any other apples, while moving up to (2,6) also brings me closer to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (2,6) to (4,8): right twice, up two times.\n\nSo, moving up might be more versatile.\n\nAlso, moving up to (2,6) doesn't put me in the same row as the enemy, whereas moving right to (3,5) keeps me on row 5, away from the enemy.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy is at (0,4), and it's snake 1, I don't know its behavior yet.\n\nPerhaps it will move towards the nearest apple, or towards me.\n\nTo be safe, I should assume it might move towards me.\n\nSo, if I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy at (0,4).\n\nThat might be risky.\n\nTherefore, maybe staying on row 5 or moving up is safer.\n\nMoreover, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) both keep me on row 5.\n\nFrom there, I can decide to move up later.\n\nBut, I need to make progress towards an apple.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,9), moving right to (3,5) and then up is a direct path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) and then right would also work.\n\nI think moving right to (3,5) is fine.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nCurrently, the board shows no other snakes or apples blocking (3,5).\n\nSo, moving right to (3,5) is safe.\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up to (2,6) and then right.\n\nBut, perhaps moving right first is fine.\n\nAlright, so my plan is to move right to (3,5), then up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,"

Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |3-3| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |3-8| + |6-4| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |3-9| + |6-0| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |3-4| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, apples at (3,9) and (4,8) are closest, both at a distance of 3.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\n- Up: (3,7)\n\n- Moves me closer to (3,9) and (4,8).\n\n- Down: (3,5)\n\n- Moves me away from the closest apples and closer to the enemy snake at (2,4).\n\n- Left: (2,6)\n\n- Moves me closer to the enemy snake at (2,4).\n\n- Right: (4,6)\n\n- Moves me closer to (4,8).\n\nGiven this, moving up or right seems like the best options.\n\nLet me think about moving up to (3,7):\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9) or right towards (4,8).\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (4,6):\n\nFrom there, I can move up towards (4,8).\n\nBoth seem viable, but moving right to (4,6) might be slightly better because it directly aligns me with the apple at (4,8).\n\nMoreover, moving up from (3,6) to (3,7) doesn't bring me directly towards any apple; I'd need to decide whether to go left or right from there.\n\nOn the other hand, moving right to (4,6) puts me in a position where I can directly move up to (4,7) and (4,8) to eat the apple at (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I choose to go for (3,9), moving up from (3,6) to (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9).\n\nI need to consider which path is safer and shorter.\n\nLet's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (3,7), the enemy snake is at (2,4). It would take several moves for the enemy to reach me, assuming it moves upwards.\n\nIf I move right to (4,6), the enemy is at (2,4), and it would need to move right and up to reach me, which might take more moves.\n\nSo, moving right seems slightly safer.\n\nAlso, moving right aligns me better with the apple at (4,8).\n\nLet me plan a path to (4,8):\n\nFrom (3,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, to (3,9):\n\nFrom (3,6) -> (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9).\n\nAlso three moves.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving right to (4,6) might be safer.\n\nLet me also consider the possibility of the enemy moving towards me.\n\nIf the enemy moves up from (2,4) to (2,5), then to (2,6), which is where I am now, but if I move right to (4,6), it would take the enemy more moves to reach me.\n\nAdditionally, I can continue moving right and up, away from the enemy.\n\nSo, moving right seems like a better choice for now.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan my next move.\n\nBut for this turn, I'll choose to move right to (4,6).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There are apples at (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,9): Column 3, Row 9\n\n- (8,4): Column 8, Row 4\n\n- (9,0): Column 9, Row 0\n\n- (4,8): Column 4, Row 8\n\n- (0,2): Column 0, Row 2\n\nMy position is (2,5): Column 2, Row 5\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (0,4): Column 0, Row 4\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- Up: (2,6)\n\n- Down: (2,4)\n\n- Left: (1,5)\n\n- Right: (3,5)\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\nSince it's the start, and the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts, I don't need to worry about its body yet. But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |2-3| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |2-8| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |2-4| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |2-0| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, apples at (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2) are all 5 steps away, while the others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\nUp: (2,6)\n\n- Not immediately dangerous.\n\nDown: (2,4)\n\n- Close to enemy snake at (0,4). Need to see if it's safe.\n\nLeft: (1,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nRight: (3,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nI should also consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (3,9) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (4,8) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (0,2) is down and to the left.\n\nSo, to reach (3,9) or (4,8), moving up would be a good start.\n\nMoving down towards (0,2) could bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,4), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy snake at (0,4). Not sure what it will do, but it's better to avoid being in its row.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any particular apple immediately, but it might set me up for a path towards one.\n\nWait, but I need a strategy to maximize points by eating apples without dying.\n\nPerhaps I should consider a path that allows me to eat the closest apple without risking collision.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (3,9).\n\nTo get from (2,5) to (3,9), I need to move right once and up four times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nFirst move: right to (3,5)\n\nThen up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,8): right twice and up three times.\n\nOr for (0,2): left twice and down three times.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (0,4), moving down might bring me closer to it.\n\nPerhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is farther, but maybe worth considering.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is way far away, at the bottom right corner. That might not be the best priority right now.\n\nSo, focusing on (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2), all at a distance of 5.\n\nI need to choose which one to go for first.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (3,9): up and right\n\n- (4,8): up and right\n\n- (0,2): down and left\n\nGiven that the enemy is on the left and down, perhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) would be safer, away from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, moving up and right might give me more space to maneuver.\n\nSo, perhaps moving towards (3,9) or (4,8).\n\nLet me think about the immediate next move.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving right to (3,5) seems like a good start towards both (3,9) and (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) also moves me closer to both.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the Manhattan distance to (3,9) from both (3,5) and (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,9): 4 steps up.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,9): right once, up three times.\n\nSo, both are similar in terms of steps.\n\nBut moving right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any other apples, while moving up to (2,6) also brings me closer to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (2,6) to (4,8): right twice, up two times.\n\nSo, moving up might be more versatile.\n\nAlso, moving up to (2,6) doesn't put me in the same row as the enemy, whereas moving right to (3,5) keeps me on row 5, away from the enemy.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy is at (0,4), and it's snake 1, I don't know its behavior yet.\n\nPerhaps it will move towards the nearest apple, or towards me.\n\nTo be safe, I should assume it might move towards me.\n\nSo, if I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy at (0,4).\n\nThat might be risky.\n\nTherefore, maybe staying on row 5 or moving up is safer.\n\nMoreover, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) both keep me on row 5.\n\nFrom there, I can decide to move up later.\n\nBut, I need to make progress towards an apple.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,9), moving right to (3,5) and then up is a direct path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) and then right would also work.\n\nI think moving right to (3,5) is fine.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nCurrently, the board shows no other snakes or apples blocking (3,5).\n\nSo, moving right to (3,5) is safe.\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up to (2,6) and then right.\n\nBut, perhaps moving right first is fine.\n\nAlright, so my plan is to move right to (3,5), then up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,"

It would take several moves for the enemy to reach me, assuming it moves upwards.\n\nIf I move right to (4,6), the enemy is at (2,4), and it would need to move right and up to reach me, which might take more moves.\n\nSo, moving right seems slightly safer.\n\nAlso, moving right aligns me better with the apple at (4,8).\n\nLet me plan a path to (4,8):\n\nFrom (3,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, to (3,9):\n\nFrom (3,6) -> (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9).\n\nAlso three moves.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving right to (4,6) might be safer.\n\nLet me also consider the possibility of the enemy moving towards me.\n\nIf the enemy moves up from (2,4) to (2,5), then to (2,6), which is where I am now, but if I move right to (4,6), it would take the enemy more moves to reach me.\n\nAdditionally, I can continue moving right and up, away from the enemy.\n\nSo, moving right seems like a better choice for now.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan my next move.\n\nBut for this turn, I'll choose to move right to (4,6).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. There are apples scattered around at positions (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,6). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (3,4) with no body parts, meaning it's just the head for now.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 2 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . 1 . . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,6), which is in row 6, column 4.\n\nI need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest. There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (4,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |4-8| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |4-4| + |6-8| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,8) with a distance of 2, followed by (3,9) at 4, and (0,2) at 8, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (4,6):\n\n- Up: (4,7)\n\n- Down: (4,5)\n\n- Left: (3,6)\n\n- Right: (5,6)\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion here. In the board layout, columns are x-coordinates and rows are y-coordinates. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nGiven that, from (4,6), moving:\n\n- Right: (5,6)\n\n- Left: (3,6)\n\n- Up: (4,7)\n\n- Down: (4,5)\n\nI need to choose the direction that gets me closer to the closest apple at (4,8).\n\nMoving up to (4,7) would decrease the distance to (4,8) by one.\n\nMoving right to (5,6) would increase the x-coordinate, moving away from (4,8).\n\nMoving left to (3,6) would decrease the x-coordinate, also moving away from (4,8).\n\nMoving down to (4,5) would move away from (4,8).\n\nSo, moving up seems like the best choice to get closer to the nearest apple.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (3,4). If I move up to (4,7), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that moving up is safe and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no immediate obstacles in the path upwards from (4,6) to (4,7) and then to (4,8).\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (3,4), it would need to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several moves, giving me enough time to eat the apple at (4,8).\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan my next move to go for another apple, likely the one at (3,9), which is nearby.\n\nSo, my plan is to move up to (4,7), then to (4,8) to eat the apple, and then perhaps to (3,9).\n\nBut for this turn, I'll choose to move up to (4,7).\n\nWait, but looking back at the possible moves from (4,6), moving up would be to (4,7).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential risks in moving up.\n\nIs there any part of my body or the enemy's body in the way? Currently, my snake is just the head at (4,6), and the enemy is at (3,4). So, moving up to (4,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter moving up to (4,7), the distance to the apple at (4,8) is now 1, so I can eat it on the next move by moving up again.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (4,8), I'll grow, but since I'm only one block right now, growing won't create any body parts to collide with.\n\nSo, it seems like a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (3,9), which is farther away, but since there's a closer apple at (4,8), it's better to go for the closer one first.\n\nMoreover, moving up towards (4,8) also allows me to potentially block the enemy from reaching that apple, although the enemy is still some distance away.\n\nBut for now, my priority is to secure the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (4,7).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--"

There are apples at (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,9): Column 3, Row 9\n\n- (8,4): Column 8, Row 4\n\n- (9,0): Column 9, Row 0\n\n- (4,8): Column 4, Row 8\n\n- (0,2): Column 0, Row 2\n\nMy position is (2,5): Column 2, Row 5\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (0,4): Column 0, Row 4\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- Up: (2,6)\n\n- Down: (2,4)\n\n- Left: (1,5)\n\n- Right: (3,5)\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\nSince it's the start, and the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts, I don't need to worry about its body yet. But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |2-3| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |2-8| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |2-4| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |2-0| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, apples at (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2) are all 5 steps away, while the others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\nUp: (2,6)\n\n- Not immediately dangerous.\n\nDown: (2,4)\n\n- Close to enemy snake at (0,4). Need to see if it's safe.\n\nLeft: (1,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nRight: (3,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nI should also consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (3,9) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (4,8) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (0,2) is down and to the left.\n\nSo, to reach (3,9) or (4,8), moving up would be a good start.\n\nMoving down towards (0,2) could bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,4), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy snake at (0,4). Not sure what it will do, but it's better to avoid being in its row.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any particular apple immediately, but it might set me up for a path towards one.\n\nWait, but I need a strategy to maximize points by eating apples without dying.\n\nPerhaps I should consider a path that allows me to eat the closest apple without risking collision.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (3,9).\n\nTo get from (2,5) to (3,9), I need to move right once and up four times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nFirst move: right to (3,5)\n\nThen up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,8): right twice and up three times.\n\nOr for (0,2): left twice and down three times.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (0,4), moving down might bring me closer to it.\n\nPerhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is farther, but maybe worth considering.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is way far away, at the bottom right corner. That might not be the best priority right now.\n\nSo, focusing on (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2), all at a distance of 5.\n\nI need to choose which one to go for first.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (3,9): up and right\n\n- (4,8): up and right\n\n- (0,2): down and left\n\nGiven that the enemy is on the left and down, perhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) would be safer, away from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, moving up and right might give me more space to maneuver.\n\nSo, perhaps moving towards (3,9) or (4,8).\n\nLet me think about the immediate next move.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving right to (3,5) seems like a good start towards both (3,9) and (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) also moves me closer to both.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the Manhattan distance to (3,9) from both (3,5) and (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,9): 4 steps up.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,9): right once, up three times.\n\nSo, both are similar in terms of steps.\n\nBut moving right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any other apples, while moving up to (2,6) also brings me closer to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (2,6) to (4,8): right twice, up two times.\n\nSo, moving up might be more versatile.\n\nAlso, moving up to (2,6) doesn't put me in the same row as the enemy, whereas moving right to (3,5) keeps me on row 5, away from the enemy.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy is at (0,4), and it's snake 1, I don't know its behavior yet.\n\nPerhaps it will move towards the nearest apple, or towards me.\n\nTo be safe, I should assume it might move towards me.\n\nSo, if I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy at (0,4).\n\nThat might be risky.\n\nTherefore, maybe staying on row 5 or moving up is safer.\n\nMoreover, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) both keep me on row 5.\n\nFrom there, I can decide to move up later.\n\nBut, I need to make progress towards an apple.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,9), moving right to (3,5) and then up is a direct path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) and then right would also work.\n\nI think moving right to (3,5) is fine.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nCurrently, the board shows no other snakes or apples blocking (3,5).\n\nSo, moving right to (3,5) is safe.\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up to (2,6) and then right.\n\nBut, perhaps moving right first is fine.\n\nAlright, so my plan is to move right to (3,5), then up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,"

However, I need to consider if the path is clear.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (3,6):\n\nFrom there, I can move up towards (3,9) or continue right towards (4,8).\n\nBoth seem viable, but moving right to (3,6) might be slightly better because it directly aligns me with the apple at (3,9).\n\nMoreover, moving up from (2,6) to (2,7) doesn't bring me directly towards any apple; I'd need to decide whether to go left or right from there.\n\nOn the other hand, moving right to (3,6) puts me in a position where I can directly move up to (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9) to eat the apple at (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I choose to go for (4,8), moving right to (3,6), then up to (3,7), (3,8), and then right to (4,8).\n\nComparatively, moving up to (2,7) and then right to (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9) for the apple at (3,9), or right to (4,7), (4,8) for the apple at (4,8).\n\nIt seems that moving right to (3,6) is a more direct path to both closest apples.\n\nAdditionally, moving right avoids the area where the enemy snake is located at (1,4).\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (1,4), it could move up towards me, or left, or down.\n\nBut since I'm at (2,6), moving right to (3,6) puts some distance between us.\n\nWhereas moving up to (2,7) keeps me in the same column as the enemy, which might be riskier if it decides to move up.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (3,6) seems like a safer and more strategic move for now.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can then plan to move up towards (3,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements in subsequent turns to adjust my path if necessary.\n\nSo, for this turn, I decide to move right to (3,6).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There are multiple apples on the board, and I need to eat them to grow and score points. There's also an enemy snake on the board, and I need to avoid running into it or myself.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,6). The apples are located at (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). The enemy snake, number 1, is at (2,4).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Let's visualize it:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (3,6), which is column 3, row 6. The enemy snake is at (2,4), which is column 2, row 4.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves from my current position:\n\n- Up: (3,7)\n\n- Down: (3,5)\n\n- Left: (2,6)\n\n- Right: (4,6)\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\nSince it's early in the game, and the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts yet, I don't need to worry about its body. But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |3-3| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |3-8| + |6-4| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |3-9| + |6-0| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |3-4| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, apples at (3,9) and (4,8) are closest, both at a distance of 3.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\n- Up: (3,7)\n\n- Moves me closer to (3,9) and (4,8).\n\n- Down: (3,5)\n\n- Moves me away from the closest apples and closer to the enemy snake at (2,4).\n\n- Left: (2,6)\n\n- Moves me closer to the enemy snake at (2,4).\n\n- Right: (4,6)\n\n- Moves me closer to (4,8).\n\nGiven this, moving up or right seems like the best options.\n\nLet me think about moving up to (3,7):\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9) or right towards (4,8).\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (4,6):\n\nFrom there, I can move up towards (4,8).\n\nBoth seem viable, but moving right to (4,6) might be slightly better because it directly aligns me with the apple at (4,8).\n\nMoreover, moving up from (3,6) to (3,7) doesn't bring me directly towards any apple; I'd need to decide whether to go left or right from there.\n\nOn the other hand, moving right to (4,6) puts me in a position where I can directly move up to (4,7) and (4,8) to eat the apple at (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I choose to go for (3,9), moving up from (3,6) to (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9).\n\nI need to consider which path is safer and shorter.\n\nLet's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move up to (3,7), the enemy snake is at (2,4). It would take several moves for the enemy to reach me, assuming it moves upwards.\n\nIf I move right to (4,6), the enemy is at (2,4), and it would need to move right and up to reach me, which might take more moves.\n\nSo, moving right seems slightly safer.\n\nAlso, moving right aligns me better with the apple at (4,8).\n\nLet me plan a path to (4,8):\n\nFrom (3,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8).\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, to (3,9):\n\nFrom (3,6) -> (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9).\n\nAlso three moves.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position, moving right to (4,6) might be safer.\n\nLet me also consider the possibility of the enemy moving towards me.\n\nIf the enemy moves up from (2,4) to (2,5), then to (2,6), which is where I am now, but if I move right to (4,6), it would take the enemy more moves to reach me.\n\nAdditionally, I can continue moving right and up, away from the enemy.\n\nSo, moving right seems like a better choice for now.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan my next move.\n\nBut for this turn, I'll choose to move right to (4,6).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (4,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |4-8| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |4-4| + |6-8| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,8) with a distance of 2, followed by (3,9) at 4, and (0,2) at 8, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (4,6):\n\n- Up: (4,7)\n\n- Down: (4,5)\n\n- Left: (3,6)\n\n- Right: (5,6)\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion here. In the board layout, columns are x-coordinates and rows are y-coordinates. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nGiven that, from (4,6), moving:\n\n- Right: (5,6)\n\n- Left: (3,6)\n\n- Up: (4,7)\n\n- Down: (4,5)\n\nI need to choose the direction that gets me closer to the closest apple at (4,8).\n\nMoving up to (4,7) would decrease the distance to (4,8) by one.\n\nMoving right to (5,6) would increase the x-coordinate, moving away from (4,8).\n\nMoving left to (3,6) would decrease the x-coordinate, also moving away from (4,8).\n\nMoving down to (4,5) would move away from (4,8).\n\nSo, moving up seems like the best choice to get closer to the nearest apple.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (3,4). If I move up to (4,7), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that moving up is safe and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no immediate obstacles in the path upwards from (4,6) to (4,7) and then to (4,8).\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (3,4), it would need to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several moves, giving me enough time to eat the apple at (4,8).\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan my next move to go for another apple, likely the one at (3,9), which is nearby.\n\nSo, my plan is to move up to (4,7), then to (4,8) to eat the apple, and then perhaps to (3,9).\n\nBut for this turn, I'll choose to move up to (4,7).\n\nWait, but looking back at the possible moves from (4,6), moving up would be to (4,7).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential risks in moving up.\n\nIs there any part of my body or the enemy's body in the way? Currently, my snake is just the head at (4,6), and the enemy is at (3,4). So, moving up to (4,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter moving up to (4,7), the distance to the apple at (4,8) is now 1, so I can eat it on the next move by moving up again.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (4,8), I'll grow, but since I'm only one block right now, growing won't create any body parts to collide with.\n\nSo, it seems like a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (3,9), which is farther away, but since there's a closer apple at (4,8), it's better to go for the closer one first.\n\nMoreover, moving up towards (4,8) also allows me to potentially block the enemy from reaching that apple, although the enemy is still some distance away.\n\nBut for now, my priority is to secure the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (4,7).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--"

Since I'm just starting, I'm only a head right now. After eating the apple, I will grow, but in this game, does growing mean I have a tail to worry about?\n\nWait, in standard Snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's specified that \"If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\" So, I need to make sure that after growing, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, since I'm only moving up and the only direction from (4,7) to (4,8) is up, and there are no other parts of my snake there, it should be safe.\n\nMoreover, after eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan to continue moving up towards (4,9), but I need to check if there's an apple there.\n\nLooking at the board, there's no apple at (4,9), but it's within the board limits, so I can move there safely, assuming no other snakes are there.\n\nBut for this turn, my immediate action is to move up to (4,8) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,4), and if it moves up, it could potentially reach (4,5), (4,6), and so on.\n\nBut since I'm moving up to (4,8), I'm putting distance between the enemy and myself.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like the safest and most rewarding move for this turn.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1.

The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: A . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,9): Column 3, Row 9\n\n- (8,4): Column 8, Row 4\n\n- (9,0): Column 9, Row 0\n\n- (4,8): Column 4, Row 8\n\n- (0,2): Column 0, Row 2\n\nMy position is (2,5): Column 2, Row 5\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (0,4): Column 0, Row 4\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- Up: (2,6)\n\n- Down: (2,4)\n\n- Left: (1,5)\n\n- Right: (3,5)\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\nSince it's the start, and the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts, I don't need to worry about its body yet. But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |2-3| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |2-8| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |2-4| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |2-0| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, apples at (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2) are all 5 steps away, while the others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\nUp: (2,6)\n\n- Not immediately dangerous.\n\nDown: (2,4)\n\n- Close to enemy snake at (0,4). Need to see if it's safe.\n\nLeft: (1,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nRight: (3,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nI should also consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (3,9) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (4,8) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (0,2) is down and to the left.\n\nSo, to reach (3,9) or (4,8), moving up would be a good start.\n\nMoving down towards (0,2) could bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,4), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy snake at (0,4). Not sure what it will do, but it's better to avoid being in its row.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any particular apple immediately, but it might set me up for a path towards one.\n\nWait, but I need a strategy to maximize points by eating apples without dying.\n\nPerhaps I should consider a path that allows me to eat the closest apple without risking collision.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (3,9).\n\nTo get from (2,5) to (3,9), I need to move right once and up four times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nFirst move: right to (3,5)\n\nThen up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,8): right twice and up three times.\n\nOr for (0,2): left twice and down three times.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (0,4), moving down might bring me closer to it.\n\nPerhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is farther, but maybe worth considering.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is way far away, at the bottom right corner. That might not be the best priority right now.\n\nSo, focusing on (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2), all at a distance of 5.\n\nI need to choose which one to go for first.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (3,9): up and right\n\n- (4,8): up and right\n\n- (0,2): down and left\n\nGiven that the enemy is on the left and down, perhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) would be safer, away from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, moving up and right might give me more space to maneuver.\n\nSo, perhaps moving towards (3,9) or (4,8).\n\nLet me think about the immediate next move.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving right to (3,5) seems like a good start towards both (3,9) and (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) also moves me closer to both.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the Manhattan distance to (3,9) from both (3,5) and (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,9): 4 steps up.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,9): right once, up three times.\n\nSo, both are similar in terms of steps.\n\nBut moving right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any other apples, while moving up to (2,6) also brings me closer to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (2,6) to (4,8): right twice, up two times.\n\nSo, moving up might be more versatile.\n\nAlso, moving up to (2,6) doesn't put me in the same row as the enemy, whereas moving right to (3,5) keeps me on row 5, away from the enemy.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy is at (0,4), and it's snake 1, I don't know its behavior yet.\n\nPerhaps it will move towards the nearest apple, or towards me.\n\nTo be safe, I should assume it might move towards me.\n\nSo, if I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy at (0,4).\n\nThat might be risky.\n\nTherefore, maybe staying on row 5 or moving up is safer.\n\nMoreover, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) both keep me on row 5.\n\nFrom there, I can decide to move up later.\n\nBut, I need to make progress towards an apple.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,9), moving right to (3,5) and then up is a direct path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) and then right would also work.\n\nI think moving right to (3,5) is fine.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nCurrently, the board shows no other snakes or apples blocking (3,5).\n\nSo, moving right to (3,5) is safe.\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up to (2,6) and then right.\n\nBut, perhaps moving right first is fine.\n\nAlright, so my plan is to move right to (3,5), then up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,"

There are apples scattered around at positions (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,6). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (3,4) with no body parts, meaning it's just the head for now.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . .

There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (4,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |4-8| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n4.

Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,8) with a distance of 2, followed by (3,9) at 4, and (0,2) at 8, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (4,6):\n\n- Up: (4,7)\n\n- Down: (4,5)\n\n- Left: (3,6)\n\n- Right: (5,6)\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion here. In the board layout, columns are x-coordinates and rows are y-coordinates. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nGiven that, from (4,6), moving:\n\n- Right: (5,6)\n\n- Left: (3,6)\n\n- Up: (4,7)\n\n- Down: (4,5)\n\nI need to choose the direction that gets me closer to the closest apple at (4,8).\n\nMoving up to (4,7) would decrease the distance to (4,8) by one.\n\nMoving right to (5,6) would increase the x-coordinate, moving away from (4,8).\n\nMoving left to (3,6) would decrease the x-coordinate, also moving away from (4,8).\n\nMoving down to (4,5) would move away from (4,8).\n\nSo, moving up seems like the best choice to get closer to the nearest apple.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (3,4). If I move up to (4,7), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that moving up is safe and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no immediate obstacles in the path upwards from (4,6) to (4,7) and then to (4,8).\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (3,4), it would need to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several moves, giving me enough time to eat the apple at (4,8).\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan my next move to go for another apple, likely the one at (3,9), which is nearby.\n\nSo, my plan is to move up to (4,7), then to (4,8) to eat the apple, and then perhaps to (3,9).\n\nBut for this turn, I'll choose to move up to (4,7).\n\nWait, but looking back at the possible moves from (4,6), moving up would be to (4,7).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential risks in moving up.\n\nIs there any part of my body or the enemy's body in the way? Currently, my snake is just the head at (4,6), and the enemy is at (3,4). So, moving up to (4,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter moving up to (4,7), the distance to the apple at (4,8) is now 1, so I can eat it on the next move by moving up again.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (4,8), I'll grow, but since I'm only one block right now, growing won't create any body parts to collide with.\n\nSo, it seems like a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (3,9), which is farther away, but since there's a closer apple at (4,8), it's better to go for the closer one first.\n\nMoreover, moving up towards (4,8) also allows me to potentially block the enemy from reaching that apple, although the enemy is still some distance away.\n\nBut for now, my priority is to secure the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (4,7).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. There are apples scattered around at positions (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,7). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (4,4) with no body parts, meaning it's just the head for now.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . .

There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (4,7):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |4-8| + |7-4| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |7-0| = 5 + 7 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |4-4| + |7-8| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |7-2| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,8) with a distance of 1, followed by (3,9) at 3, and (0,2) at 9, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (4,7):\n\n- Up: (4,8)\n\n- Down: (4,6)\n\n- Left: (3,7)\n\n- Right: (5,7)\n\nI need to choose the direction that gets me closer to the closest apple.\n\nMoving up to (4,8) would directly reach the apple at (4,8), which is ideal.\n\nMoving down to (4,6) would move me away from the apple at (4,8).\n\nMoving left to (3,7) would move me closer to the apple at (3,9), but it's farther away compared to the apple at (4,8).\n\nMoving right to (5,7) would not bring me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo, moving up to (4,8) seems like the best choice because it allows me to eat the apple and gain a point.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving up is safe and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no immediate obstacles in the path upwards from (4,7) to (4,8).\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (4,4), it would need to move up to reach me, but since I'm moving up to eat the apple, I can continue moving up to (4,9) if possible, to stay away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, the apple at (4,8) is at y=8, and moving up from there would be y=9, which is within the board limits.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,8), I can consider my next move.\n\nBut for this turn, moving up to (4,8) to eat the apple is the priority.\n\nI should also think about my snake's length. Since I'm just starting, I'm only a head right now. After eating the apple, I will grow, but in this game, does growing mean I have a tail to worry about?\n\nWait, in standard Snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's specified that \"If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\" So, I need to make sure that after growing, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, since I'm only moving up and the only direction from (4,7) to (4,8) is up, and there are no other parts of my snake there, it should be safe.\n\nMoreover, after eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan to continue moving up towards (4,9), but I need to check if there's an apple there.\n\nLooking at the board, there's no apple at (4,9), but it's within the board limits, so I can move there safely, assuming no other snakes are there.\n\nBut for this turn, my immediate action is to move up to (4,8) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,4), and if it moves up, it could potentially reach (4,5), (4,6), and so on.\n\nBut since I'm moving up to (4,8), I'm putting distance between the enemy and myself.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like the safest and most rewarding move for this turn.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1.

There are apples scattered around at positions (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (0,2), and (0,6). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,8).

There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (4,8):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |4-8| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |8-0| = 5 + 8 = 13\n\n4. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |8-2| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |8-6| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,9) with a distance of 2, followed by (0,6) at 6, then (0,2) at 10, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (4,8):\n\n- Up: (4,9)\n\n- Down: (4,7)\n\n- Left: (3,8)\n\n- Right: (5,8)\n\nI need to choose the direction that gets me closer to the closest apple.\n\nMoving up to (4,9) would be moving towards (3,9), reducing the x-distance by 1.\n\nMoving left to (3,8) would also reduce the x-distance to (3,9).\n\nMoving down to (4,7) would move me away from (3,9).\n\nMoving right to (5,8) would move me further away from (3,9).\n\nSo, moving up or left seems beneficial.\n\nBut let's consider the immediate positions:\n\n- (4,9): Is this position occupied? Looking at the board, row 9, column 4 is empty.\n\n- (3,8): Row 8, column 3 is empty.\n\nBoth seem safe, but moving up to (4,9) would be closer to the apple at (3,9).\n\nAfter moving up to (4,9), the distance to (3,9) would be |4-3| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (3,8) would make the distance |3-3| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo, both moves bring me equally closer to the apple at (3,9).\n\nHowever, moving up to (4,9) might be better because from there, I can move left to (3,9) to eat the apple.\n\nWhereas moving left to (3,8) would require moving up to (3,9).\n\nBut both paths seem equivalent in terms of steps.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position and potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,4), and it's possible that it might move towards the apple at (8,4).\n\nBut for now, it's relatively far away from me.\n\nGiven that, I should focus on getting to the apple at (3,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nLet me think about the path to (3,9):\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move up to (4,9)\n\n- Move left to (3,9)\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move left to (3,8)\n\n- Move up to (3,9)\n\nBoth options take two moves to reach the apple.\n\nBut perhaps I can consider the board layout and potential future moves.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (4,9) and then left to (3,9) seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,9), I would grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to continue moving without running into myself.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (3,9), my tail will stay at (4,8) for the next move.\n\nSo, if I move from (3,9) to (3,10), which is off the board, I would die.\n\nWait, row 9 is the top row, so moving up from (3,9) would be off the board.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (3,9), I need to consider my next move carefully.\n\nI should plan to move left to (2,9), but I need to ensure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (3,8) after eating the apple at (3,9).\n\nBut moving down to (3,8) would be safe, as it's within the board limits.\n\nLet me map this out:\n\n1. Current position: (4,8)\n\n2. Move up to (4,9)\n\n3. Move left to (3,9) to eat the apple\n\n4. Then, move down to (3,8)\n\nThis seems safe.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Move left to (3,8)\n\n2. Move up to (3,9) to eat the apple\n\n3. Then, move left to (2,9)\n\nBut moving left from (3,9) to (2,9) is also safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there are any potential threats or obstacles in these paths.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in these positions, so it should be safe.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,4), and it might move towards the apple at (8,4).\n\nIf it does, it would need to move right to (6,4), then to (7,4), and finally to (8,4).\n\nThis would take a few moves, giving me time to reach (3,9) and potentially another apple before the enemy reaches its target.\n\nGiven that, I should prioritize reaching (3,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be up to (4,9), getting closer to the apple at (3,9).\n\nI should also consider if there are any other apples that might be easier to reach or pose less risk.\n\nLooking at the apple at (0,6), which is at a distance of 6 from my current position.\n\nComparatively, the apple at (3,9) is closer at a distance of 2.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for the closer apple first.\n\nAdditionally, moving towards (3,9) puts me in a position where I can potentially reach other apples later, depending on the board state.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this turn is to move up to (4,9).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1.

There are apples at (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (4,8), and (0,2). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (0,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,9): Column 3, Row 9\n\n- (8,4): Column 8, Row 4\n\n- (9,0): Column 9, Row 0\n\n- (4,8): Column 4, Row 8\n\n- (0,2): Column 0, Row 2\n\nMy position is (2,5): Column 2, Row 5\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (0,4): Column 0, Row 4\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible moves and their implications.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- Up: (2,6)\n\n- Down: (2,4)\n\n- Left: (1,5)\n\n- Right: (3,5)\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into walls, myself, or the enemy snake.\n\nSince it's the start, and the enemy snake doesn't have any body parts, I don't need to worry about its body yet. But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |2-3| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |2-8| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |2-4| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |2-0| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, apples at (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2) are all 5 steps away, while the others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\nUp: (2,6)\n\n- Not immediately dangerous.\n\nDown: (2,4)\n\n- Close to enemy snake at (0,4). Need to see if it's safe.\n\nLeft: (1,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nRight: (3,5)\n\n- Seems safe.\n\nI should also consider the positions of the apples relative to my current position.\n\nApple at (3,9) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (4,8) is up and to the right.\n\nApple at (0,2) is down and to the left.\n\nSo, to reach (3,9) or (4,8), moving up would be a good start.\n\nMoving down towards (0,2) could bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,4), which is to the left and down from my position.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy snake at (0,4). Not sure what it will do, but it's better to avoid being in its row.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any particular apple immediately, but it might set me up for a path towards one.\n\nWait, but I need a strategy to maximize points by eating apples without dying.\n\nPerhaps I should consider a path that allows me to eat the closest apple without risking collision.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (3,9).\n\nTo get from (2,5) to (3,9), I need to move right once and up four times.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nFirst move: right to (3,5)\n\nThen up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,8): right twice and up three times.\n\nOr for (0,2): left twice and down three times.\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (0,4), moving down might bring me closer to it.\n\nPerhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is farther, but maybe worth considering.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,0) is way far away, at the bottom right corner. That might not be the best priority right now.\n\nSo, focusing on (3,9), (4,8), and (0,2), all at a distance of 5.\n\nI need to choose which one to go for first.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (3,9): up and right\n\n- (4,8): up and right\n\n- (0,2): down and left\n\nGiven that the enemy is on the left and down, perhaps going for (3,9) or (4,8) would be safer, away from the enemy.\n\nMoreover, moving up and right might give me more space to maneuver.\n\nSo, perhaps moving towards (3,9) or (4,8).\n\nLet me think about the immediate next move.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving right to (3,5) seems like a good start towards both (3,9) and (4,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) also moves me closer to both.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the Manhattan distance to (3,9) from both (3,5) and (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,9): 4 steps up.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,9): right once, up three times.\n\nSo, both are similar in terms of steps.\n\nBut moving right to (3,5) doesn't bring me closer to any other apples, while moving up to (2,6) also brings me closer to (4,8).\n\nWait, from (2,6) to (4,8): right twice, up two times.\n\nSo, moving up might be more versatile.\n\nAlso, moving up to (2,6) doesn't put me in the same row as the enemy, whereas moving right to (3,5) keeps me on row 5, away from the enemy.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy is at (0,4), and it's snake 1, I don't know its behavior yet.\n\nPerhaps it will move towards the nearest apple, or towards me.\n\nTo be safe, I should assume it might move towards me.\n\nSo, if I move down to (2,4), I'm directly above the enemy at (0,4).\n\nThat might be risky.\n\nTherefore, maybe staying on row 5 or moving up is safer.\n\nMoreover, moving left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) both keep me on row 5.\n\nFrom there, I can decide to move up later.\n\nBut, I need to make progress towards an apple.\n\nLooking at the apple at (3,9), moving right to (3,5) and then up is a direct path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) and then right would also work.\n\nI think moving right to (3,5) is fine.\n\nLet me check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nCurrently, the board shows no other snakes or apples blocking (3,5).\n\nSo, moving right to (3,5) is safe.\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up to (2,6) and then right.\n\nBut, perhaps moving right first is fine.\n\nAlright, so my plan is to move right to (3,5), then up to (3,6), (3,7), (3,"

Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (1,4), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . .

But I should be cautious not to collide with its head.\n\nAlso, I need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance:\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |2-3| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |2-8| + |6-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |2-9| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |2-4| + |6-8| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |2-0| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, apples at (3,9) and (4,8) are closest, both at a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these is the easiest to reach without risking collision with the enemy or myself.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\n- Up: (2,7)\n\n- Not immediately dangerous, and moves me closer to (3,9) and (4,8).\n\n- Down: (2,5)\n\n- Moves me away from the closest apples and closer to the enemy snake at (1,4).\n\n- Left: (1,6)\n\n- Moves me closer to the enemy snake at (1,4).\n\n- Right: (3,6)\n\n- Moves me closer to (3,9) and (4,8).\n\nGiven this, moving up or right seems like the best options.\n\nLet me think about moving up to (2,7):\n\nFrom there, I can continue moving up towards (3,9) or (4,8). However, I need to consider if the path is clear.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (3,6):\n\nFrom there, I can move up towards (3,9) or continue right towards (4,8).\n\nBoth seem viable, but moving right to (3,6) might be slightly better because it directly aligns me with the apple at (3,9).\n\nMoreover, moving up from (2,6) to (2,7) doesn't bring me directly towards any apple; I'd need to decide whether to go left or right from there.\n\nOn the other hand, moving right to (3,6) puts me in a position where I can directly move up to (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9) to eat the apple at (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, if I choose to go for (4,8), moving right to (3,6), then up to (3,7), (3,8), and then right to (4,8).\n\nComparatively, moving up to (2,7) and then right to (3,7), (3,8), and (3,9) for the apple at (3,9), or right to (4,7), (4,8) for the apple at (4,8).\n\nIt seems that moving right to (3,6) is a more direct path to both closest apples.\n\nAdditionally, moving right avoids the area where the enemy snake is located at (1,4).\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy snake is at (1,4), it could move up towards me, or left, or down.\n\nBut since I'm at (2,6), moving right to (3,6) puts some distance between us.\n\nWhereas moving up to (2,7) keeps me in the same column as the enemy, which might be riskier if it decides to move up.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (3,6) seems like a safer and more strategic move for now.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can then plan to move up towards (3,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements in subsequent turns to adjust my path if necessary.\n\nSo, for this turn, I decide to move right to (3,6).\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (4,6):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |4-8| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |4-4| + |6-8| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,8) with a distance of 2, followed by (3,9) at 4, and (0,2) at 8, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (4,6):\n\n- Up: (4,7)\n\n- Down: (4,5)\n\n- Left: (3,6)\n\n- Right: (5,6)\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion here. In the board layout, columns are x-coordinates and rows are y-coordinates. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nGiven that, from (4,6), moving:\n\n- Right: (5,6)\n\n- Left: (3,6)\n\n- Up: (4,7)\n\n- Down: (4,5)\n\nI need to choose the direction that gets me closer to the closest apple at (4,8).\n\nMoving up to (4,7) would decrease the distance to (4,8) by one.\n\nMoving right to (5,6) would increase the x-coordinate, moving away from (4,8).\n\nMoving left to (3,6) would decrease the x-coordinate, also moving away from (4,8).\n\nMoving down to (4,5) would move away from (4,8).\n\nSo, moving up seems like the best choice to get closer to the nearest apple.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (3,4). If I move up to (4,7), I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that moving up is safe and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no immediate obstacles in the path upwards from (4,6) to (4,7) and then to (4,8).\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (3,4), it would need to move up and to the right to reach me, which might take several moves, giving me enough time to eat the apple at (4,8).\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan my next move to go for another apple, likely the one at (3,9), which is nearby.\n\nSo, my plan is to move up to (4,7), then to (4,8) to eat the apple, and then perhaps to (3,9).\n\nBut for this turn, I'll choose to move up to (4,7).\n\nWait, but looking back at the possible moves from (4,6), moving up would be to (4,7).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential risks in moving up.\n\nIs there any part of my body or the enemy's body in the way? Currently, my snake is just the head at (4,6), and the enemy is at (3,4). So, moving up to (4,7) should be safe.\n\nAfter moving up to (4,7), the distance to the apple at (4,8) is now 1, so I can eat it on the next move by moving up again.\n\nOnce I eat the apple at (4,8), I'll grow, but since I'm only one block right now, growing won't create any body parts to collide with.\n\nSo, it seems like a safe move.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for the apple at (3,9), which is farther away, but since there's a closer apple at (4,8), it's better to go for the closer one first.\n\nMoreover, moving up towards (4,8) also allows me to potentially block the enemy from reaching that apple, although the enemy is still some distance away.\n\nBut for now, my priority is to secure the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move up to (4,7).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--"

A . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . 1 . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,7), which is in row 7, column 4.\n\nI need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest. There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (4,7):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |4-8| + |7-4| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |7-0| = 5 + 7 = 12\n\n4. Apple at (4,8):\n\nDistance = |4-4| + |7-8| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n5. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |7-2| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,8) with a distance of 1, followed by (3,9) at 3, and (0,2) at 9, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (4,7):\n\n- Up: (4,8)\n\n- Down: (4,6)\n\n- Left: (3,7)\n\n- Right: (5,7)\n\nI need to choose the direction that gets me closer to the closest apple.\n\nMoving up to (4,8) would directly reach the apple at (4,8), which is ideal.\n\nMoving down to (4,6) would move me away from the apple at (4,8).\n\nMoving left to (3,7) would move me closer to the apple at (3,9), but it's farther away compared to the apple at (4,8).\n\nMoving right to (5,7) would not bring me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo, moving up to (4,8) seems like the best choice because it allows me to eat the apple and gain a point.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving up is safe and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no immediate obstacles in the path upwards from (4,7) to (4,8).\n\nAlso, considering the enemy's position at (4,4), it would need to move up to reach me, but since I'm moving up to eat the apple, I can continue moving up to (4,9) if possible, to stay away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, the apple at (4,8) is at y=8, and moving up from there would be y=9, which is within the board limits.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,8), I can consider my next move.\n\nBut for this turn, moving up to (4,8) to eat the apple is the priority.\n\nI should also think about my snake's length. Since I'm just starting, I'm only a head right now. After eating the apple, I will grow, but in this game, does growing mean I have a tail to worry about?\n\nWait, in standard Snake games, eating an apple makes your tail grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this game, it's specified that \"If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\" So, I need to make sure that after growing, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, since I'm only moving up and the only direction from (4,7) to (4,8) is up, and there are no other parts of my snake there, it should be safe.\n\nMoreover, after eating the apple at (4,8), I can plan to continue moving up towards (4,9), but I need to check if there's an apple there.\n\nLooking at the board, there's no apple at (4,9), but it's within the board limits, so I can move there safely, assuming no other snakes are there.\n\nBut for this turn, my immediate action is to move up to (4,8) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,4), and if it moves up, it could potentially reach (4,5), (4,6), and so on.\n\nBut since I'm moving up to (4,8), I'm putting distance between the enemy and myself.\n\nTherefore, moving up seems like the safest and most rewarding move for this turn.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1. If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2. If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n\n3. The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\n**Decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.**\n\n**Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.**\n\n**You may think out loud first then respond with the direction.**\n\n**You may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.**\n\n**End your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.**\n\n**UP**"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. There are apples scattered around at positions (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (0,2), and (0,6). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (4,8).

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,8), which is in row 8, column 4.\n\nI need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest. There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (4,8):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |4-8| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |4-9| + |8-0| = 5 + 8 = 13\n\n4. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |8-2| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |8-6| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,9) with a distance of 2, followed by (0,6) at 6, then (0,2) at 10, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (4,8):\n\n- Up: (4,9)\n\n- Down: (4,7)\n\n- Left: (3,8)\n\n- Right: (5,8)\n\nI need to choose the direction that gets me closer to the closest apple.\n\nMoving up to (4,9) would be moving towards (3,9), reducing the x-distance by 1.\n\nMoving left to (3,8) would also reduce the x-distance to (3,9).\n\nMoving down to (4,7) would move me away from (3,9).\n\nMoving right to (5,8) would move me further away from (3,9).\n\nSo, moving up or left seems beneficial.\n\nBut let's consider the immediate positions:\n\n- (4,9): Is this position occupied? Looking at the board, row 9, column 4 is empty.\n\n- (3,8): Row 8, column 3 is empty.\n\nBoth seem safe, but moving up to (4,9) would be closer to the apple at (3,9).\n\nAfter moving up to (4,9), the distance to (3,9) would be |4-3| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (3,8) would make the distance |3-3| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo, both moves bring me equally closer to the apple at (3,9).\n\nHowever, moving up to (4,9) might be better because from there, I can move left to (3,9) to eat the apple.\n\nWhereas moving left to (3,8) would require moving up to (3,9).\n\nBut both paths seem equivalent in terms of steps.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position and potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,4), and it's possible that it might move towards the apple at (8,4).\n\nBut for now, it's relatively far away from me.\n\nGiven that, I should focus on getting to the apple at (3,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nLet me think about the path to (3,9):\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move up to (4,9)\n\n- Move left to (3,9)\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move left to (3,8)\n\n- Move up to (3,9)\n\nBoth options take two moves to reach the apple.\n\nBut perhaps I can consider the board layout and potential future moves.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (4,9) and then left to (3,9) seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,9), I would grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to continue moving without running into myself.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (3,9), my tail will stay at (4,8) for the next move.\n\nSo, if I move from (3,9) to (3,10), which is off the board, I would die.\n\nWait, row 9 is the top row, so moving up from (3,9) would be off the board.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (3,9), I need to consider my next move carefully.\n\nI should plan to move left to (2,9), but I need to ensure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (3,8) after eating the apple at (3,9).\n\nBut moving down to (3,8) would be safe, as it's within the board limits.\n\nLet me map this out:\n\n1. Current position: (4,8)\n\n2. Move up to (4,9)\n\n3. Move left to (3,9) to eat the apple\n\n4. Then, move down to (3,8)\n\nThis seems safe.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Move left to (3,8)\n\n2. Move up to (3,9) to eat the apple\n\n3. Then, move left to (2,9)\n\nBut moving left from (3,9) to (2,9) is also safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there are any potential threats or obstacles in these paths.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no other snakes or apples in these positions, so it should be safe.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,4), and it might move towards the apple at (8,4).\n\nIf it does, it would need to move right to (6,4), then to (7,4), and finally to (8,4).\n\nThis would take a few moves, giving me time to reach (3,9) and potentially another apple before the enemy reaches its target.\n\nGiven that, I should prioritize reaching (3,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be up to (4,9), getting closer to the apple at (3,9).\n\nI should also consider if there are any other apples that might be easier to reach or pose less risk.\n\nLooking at the apple at (0,6), which is at a distance of 6 from my current position.\n\nComparatively, the apple at (3,9) is closer at a distance of 2.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for the closer apple first.\n\nAdditionally, moving towards (3,9) puts me in a position where I can potentially reach other apples later, depending on the board state.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this turn is to move up to (4,9).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1.

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this Snake game. Let's see the current state.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (3,9), (8,4), (9,0), (0,2), and (0,6). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (3,8). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (6,4) with no body parts, meaning it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and which one is closest to me. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position at (3,8):\n\n1. Apple at (3,9):\n\nDistance = |3-3| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n2. Apple at (8,4):\n\nDistance = |3-8| + |8-4| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n3. Apple at (9,0):\n\nDistance = |3-9| + |8-0| = 6 + 8 = 14\n\n4. Apple at (0,2):\n\nDistance = |3-0| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n5. Apple at (0,6):\n\nDistance = |3-0| + |8-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,9) with a distance of 1, which is directly above me. That seems like the obvious choice to go for first.\n\nNow, looking at my possible moves from (3,8):\n\n- Up: (3,9) - which is the apple.\n\n- Down: (3,7)\n\n- Left: (2,8)\n\n- Right: (4,8)\n\nSince moving up would place me on the apple at (3,9), I would eat it, grow longer, and gain a point. But I need to think about where I'll go after that.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,9), my tail will remain at (3,8) for the next move. So, if I move from (3,9) to (3,10), but the board only goes up to y=9, so that's off the board and I would die. Therefore, I need to plan my next move carefully.\n\nAlternatively, if I eat the apple at (3,9), I could move left or right to (2,9) or (4,9), provided those spaces are empty.\n\nLooking at the board, row 9, column 2 is empty, and column 4 is empty. So, moving left to (2,9) or right to (4,9) would be safe.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy snake's position and its possible moves. The enemy is at (6,4), and it might move towards the apple at (8,4). If it does, it would need to move right to (7,4) and then to (8,4). This would take a couple of moves, giving me time to secure the apple at (3,9) and perhaps position myself for another apple.\n\nMoreover, after eating the apple at (3,9), I could consider moving towards another apple. The next closest apple is at (0,6) with a distance of 5 from my current position. After eating (3,9), the distance to (0,6) would be |3-0| + |9-6| = 3 + 3 = 6, which is a bit further, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the apple at (0,2), which is also distance 9 from my current position, but that seems too far to worry about right now.\n\nGiven that, my immediate goal should be to eat the apple at (3,9), then position myself in a way that allows me to move towards another apple without dying.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Move up to (3,9) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, move left to (2,9) or right to (4,9), depending on which direction is safer and closer to the next apple.\n\n3. From there, assess the board again and decide on the next apple to go for.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (3,9), I don't immediately put myself in a position where I'll hit a wall or myself.\n\nWait a minute, after eating the apple at (3,9), my tail will be at (3,8). So, if I move from (3,9) to (2,9), I need to make sure that (2,9) is empty, which it is, according to the board.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (4,9) is also safe.\n\nSo, both left and right are safe moves after eating the apple at (3,9).\n\nNow, considering the enemy's position at (6,4), it's relatively far from me, so I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this turn should be to move up to (3,9) to eat the apple.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**End of your last move information.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1.
