However, it may require multiple moves and is less optimal as I move away from any future options.\n- **Apple at (8, 2):** Too far and requires a move away from the current strategic center of the board.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\n1. Moving to **(5, 8)** by going **LEFT** efficiently aligns me towards the apple at (4, 9) and keeps me centralized enough to redirect if needed.\n2. This move does not risk any immediate collision with Snake #2, given their current position.\n3. Collecting the apple at (4, 9) next move enhances my position further, allowing a pivot if necessary towards other apples or away from threats.\n\n**Next Move and Future Strategy:**\n\n- **Move LEFT to (5, 8):** Preparing to pursue the apple at (4, 9) optimally.\n- This move supports a future orientation where I can decide between approaching more apples or tracking Snake #2's movements, keeping my lead and strategy adaptable.\n\n**Decided Move: LEFT**"
