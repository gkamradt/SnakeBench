The apples are at (9, 3), (2, 9), (8, 7), (8, 2), and (9, 1). \n\nTo decide my next move, I have to consider both the available apples and the danger posed by the enemy snake. The enemy snake is currently at (9, 2) and can potentially block my path or corner me.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP (to (0, 2))**: This moves me to (0, 2). It's safe and doesn't run into a wall or another snake, but it doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n2. **DOWN (to (0, 0))**: This moves me down to (0, 0). It is safe but also doesn't lead me towards an apple.\n3. **LEFT (to (-1, 1))**: This goes out of bounds and is not permitted.\n4. **RIGHT (to (1, 1))**: This moves me to (1, 1) where there are no immediate apples, but it keeps me out of danger since I'm rather far from the enemy and it opens pathways for future moves.\n\n### Apple Strategy:\nThe nearest apples currently are at (8, 2) and (9, 1), but both require me to maneuver around the enemy snake. My next move also needs to consider the potential for the enemy snake to block my pathway.\n\n### Plan:\n- I will move **RIGHT (to (1, 1))**. This keeps me safe from the enemy snake and allows more mobility for future moves towards apples without directly crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

I'm not too close to any of them, so I'll need to plan my next move carefully.\n\nI'll start by trying to get closer to the apple at (9, 3), which is relatively close to my current position. I can move right to get closer to it. I'll also keep an eye on the other snakes, especially the one at (0, 1), which is relatively close to me.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to try to get closer to the apple at (9, 3) while keeping an eye on the other snakes.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
