Moving right is also not ideal as it would take me towards the enemy snake without any immediate gain of apples. Moving down would move me towards an apple, but it would also bring me closer to the enemy snake and limit my future moves.\n\nTherefore, the best move seems to be UP, as it allows me to start heading towards the apple at (9, 0) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake and the wall.\n\nNext move: UP"
