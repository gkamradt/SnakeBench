We've successfully eaten the apple and gained a point.\n\nNow, we need to decide our next move. We were planning to move up to get to the apple at (1, 2), which is still a good plan. However, we should also be aware of the enemy snake #2, which is at position (6, 2) with its body at [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)]. We should avoid getting too close to it.\n\nMoving up will give us a better position to move towards the apple at (1, 2) and also keep us away from the enemy snake #2.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After we eat the apple at (1, 2), we'll continue to move towards the apple at (0, 6) or (6, 0). We should prioritize the apple at (0, 6) since it's closer to our current position.\n\nNext move: UP"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "Let's assess the current situation. Our snake is currently positioned at (6, 2) and we have apples at (1, 2), (6, 0), (6, 7), (0, 6), and (0, 7). The enemy snake, #1, is at (2, 1) with a body at [(2, 2), (3, 2)]. \n\nWe've just moved left, and now we're at the position (6, 2). Since we're not at the same position as any apple, we didn't collect any apple and didn't grow. \n\nNow, we should consider moving towards other apples. The closest apple is at (6, 0) or (6, 7), but we should also be cautious of the enemy snake, which is currently at (2, 1). Since the enemy snake is quite far from us, we can consider moving towards the apple at (6, 0) or (6, 7). \n\nHowever, before we make a move, let's consider the possible paths. Moving towards (6, 0) would require us to move down, while moving towards (6, 7) would require us to move up. \n\nConsidering the enemy snake's position, it might be safer to move towards (6, 7) to avoid a potential collision. \n\nSince we are already at x-coordinate 6, which is the same x-coordinate as the apple at (6, 7), we can move up to get closer to the apple.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving towards the apple at (6, 7), we should continue to assess the board state and adjust our path accordingly. We should prioritize avoiding collisions with the enemy snake and the walls, and consider moving towards other apples.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
