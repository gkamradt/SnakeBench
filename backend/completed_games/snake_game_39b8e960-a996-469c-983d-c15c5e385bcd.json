The best approach here is to move UP to (7, 7), as this may give me space to maneuver in the subsequent turns toward (5, 4) and avoid confrontation with the enemy snake at the same time.\n\nDecided next move: **UP**."

My proximity to other apples (5,4), (5,0), (5,3) and (9,4) isn't great, but (5, 7) is very close.  \n\nStrategy for next turn:  Prioritize immediate apples.

I need to focus on reaching the closest apple at (5, 4) while ensuring I do not get cornered by the enemy snake.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- My snake has just grown by collecting an apple and is now longer at 3 segments (including my head).\n- The next apple is at (5, 4), but I need to be mindful of Snake #1's position.\n\n### Possible Moves Analysis:\n1. **UP (7, 7)**: I can move up to (7, 7), but this position has already been occupied by myself in the previous turn, so this is not a good move.\n   \n2. **DOWN (7, 5)**: Going down retraces my steps, effectively putting me back at (7, 5), which does not help advance me toward apples and keeps me trapped near the enemy snake. \n\n3. **LEFT (6, 6)**: This move is safe. It places me away from any immediate threat from Snake #1 and keeps me between (5, 4) and the snake, giving me some breathing room for future turns.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8, 6)**: This move takes me away from (5, 4) and into a less favorable position on the board. \n\nGiven my analysis and the board situation, the best move is to go LEFT to (6, 6). This keeps me safe for the moment while also maintaining an approach to the apple at (5, 4) in the future.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nGoing forward, I need to keep focusing on positioning myself toward the remaining apples while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #1. After this move, my goal will be to evaluate upcoming moves carefully to approach (5, 4) without getting caught or blocked.\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

The goal is still to reach the nearest apples at (5, 4) and the subsequent ones without getting caught by Snake #1.\n\n### Analyzing the Board After My Last Move:\n- My head is now at (6, 6).\n- The body of Snake #1 is positioned at (5, 7) moving downwards. A large portion of its body is taking up the (4, x) and (5, x) areas.\n- The apples are at (5, 4), (9, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), and (5, 5).\n\n### Possible Moves from (6, 6):\n1. **UP (6, 7)**: Indicates moving back to my previous position at (6, 7), which is not a good move since I can't retrace my steps.\n   \n2. **DOWN (6, 5)**: This move goes down to (6, 5), where I would be placing myself in the way of player growth but closer to the apple at (5, 5). However, it does not get me closer to (5, 4) immediately.\n\n3. **LEFT (5, 6)**: This move would take me directly toward the column of (5, x) where my target apples reside. After this, I can plan for a future move down to (5, 5), and then left to (5, 4) to collect the apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT (7, 6)**: This moves me back towards (7, 6), which is also my previous position. Not optimal.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe most strategic move is to go LEFT to (5, 6). This will allow me to position myself for a subsequent move down to (5, 5), eventually allowing me to collect (5, 4) to gain points.\n\n### Future Strategy:\nI need to work toward collecting apples at (5, 4) as my immediate objective. I should keep monitoring Snake #1's movement to ensure I remain a safe distance from it and prevent potential entrapment.\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."
