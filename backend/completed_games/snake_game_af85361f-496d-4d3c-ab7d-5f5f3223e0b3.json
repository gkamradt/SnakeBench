            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,8). There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm at (7,8), which is towards the top right of the board. There's another snake, snake #1, at (0,2), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples scattered around the board: (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I should consider which one is closest to my current position to minimize the time and risk involved in getting there.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple, since the snake can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nStarting with (6,5):\n\nDistance to (6,5):\n\n|7 - 6| + |8 - 5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext, (3,3):\n\n|7 - 3| + |8 - 3| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\nThen, (8,3):\n\n|7 - 8| + |8 - 3| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n(2,7):\n\n|7 - 2| + |8 - 7| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nAnd (3,5):\n\n|7 - 3| + |8 - 5| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,5) with a distance of 4. That seems like a good target to aim for first.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and any potential obstacles. Snake #1 is at (0,2), and since it's at the bottom left, and I'm at (7,8) in the top right, it might not be immediately threatening. However, I should keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to (6,5). Let's map out the steps:\n\nFrom (7,8) to (6,5):\n\n- Move left to (6,8)\n\n- Move down to (6,7)\n\n- Move down to (6,6)\n\n- Move down to (6,5)\n\nThat's a total of three moves: left, then down three times.\n\nBut I should check if there are any apples or obstacles in between. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for my head at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (3,7)\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for me at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (3,7)? Wait, the apple positions are (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), (3,5). So, there's an apple at (2,7), not (3,7). Maybe it's a typo in the board state.\n\nRow 6: all dots\n\nRow 5: dots except for apples at (3,5) and (6,5)\n\nRow 4: all dots\n\nRow 3: dots except for apples at (3,3) and (8,3)\n\nRow 2: snake #1 at (0,2)\n\nRow 1: all dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nSo, from (7,8) to (6,5):\n\n- Left to (6,8)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n(6,8): safe, no obstacles\n\n(6,7): safe\n\n(6,6): safe\n\n(6,5): apple\n\nSeems straightforward. No other snakes or apples in the way.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are shorter paths or if I might be walking into a trap. Since it's a straight path and no immediate threats, it seems acceptable.\n\nHowever, I should think about what to do after eating the apple at (6,5). Will that lead me closer to another apple or put me in a position where I can efficiently reach others?\n\nAfter eating (6,5), I'll be at (6,5) with an extended body. Let's consider the next apple to go for. The closest remaining apple would be (3,5), which is three steps to the left.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (3,5):\n\n- Left to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n(5,5): safe\n\n(4,5): safe\n\n(3,5): apple\n\nThis seems safe as well.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is closest at that point.\n\nPossible targets: (2,7), (3,3), (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (3,5) (already eaten).\n\nSo, (2,7) and (3,3) are options.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut wait, there's no apple at (3,7), but there is one at (2,7). So:\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,6): safe\n\n(3,7): safe\n\n(2,7): apple\n\nSeems okay.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nWhich is two steps down.\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,4): safe\n\n(3,3): apple\n\nThis is shorter, so maybe better.\n\nConsidering the positions, perhaps going for (3,3) first after (3,5) would be more efficient, as it's only two steps down.\n\nAfter eating (3,3), the remaining apples are at (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (2,7), (3,5) (eaten).\n\nSo, apples left: (8,3) and (2,7).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\n- Right to (6,3)\n\n- Right to (7,3)\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\nThat's five steps to the right.\n\nAlternatively, to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nThat's five steps up and one left.\n\nComparing the two paths, going to (8,3) is five steps to the right, while going to (2,7) is up and left.\n\nGiven that (8,3) is in the opposite direction from (2,7), it might be more efficient to choose one path over the other based on which apple is more central or which path has fewer obstacles.\n\nBut in this case, since the board is relatively open, either path could work.\n\nHowever, I need to plan this step by step, considering that I have to make moves one at a time, and I don't know how the other snake will move.\n\nAlso, I should consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, my snake grows longer, which could potentially block my own path or make turns more complicated.\n\nGiven that, I should try to keep my path as straightforward as possible, minimizing tight turns or paths that could trap me.\n\nLooking back at my initial plan:\n\n1. Go from (7,8) to (6,5)\n\n2. Then to (3,5)\n\n3. Then to (3,3)\n\n4. Then decide between (8,3) and (2,7)\n\nThis seems like a reasonable sequence, but it's a bit spread out. Maybe there's a better way to order the apple consumption to minimize travel time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (8,3) next, since it's somewhat in line with my initial position.\n\nLet me consider an alternative path:\n\nFrom (7,8) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (8,8)\n\n- Down to (8,7)\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nThat's one right and five downs, totaling six moves.\n\nBut compared to the initial plan of four moves to (6,5), this seems longer.\n\nMoreover, after eating (8,3), I'd need to go to another apple, which might not be efficient.\n\nSo,"

There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm at (7,7), which is towards the top right of the board. There's another snake, snake #1, at (0,3), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples scattered around the board: (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I should consider which one is closest to my current position to minimize the time and risk involved in getting there.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple, since the snake can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nStarting with (6,5):\n\nDistance to (6,5):\n\n|7 - 6| + |7 - 5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nNext, (3,3):\n\n|7 - 3| + |7 - 3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nThen, (8,3):\n\n|7 - 8| + |7 - 3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n(2,7):\n\n|7 - 2| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\nAnd (3,5):\n\n|7 - 3| + |7 - 5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,5) with a distance of 3. That seems like a good target to aim for first.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and any potential obstacles. Snake #1 is at (0,3), and since it's at the bottom left, and I'm at (7,7) in the top right, it might not be immediately threatening. However, I should keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to (6,5). Let's map out the steps:\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,5):\n\n- Move left to (6,7)\n\n- Move down to (6,6)\n\n- Move down to (6,5)\n\nThat's a total of two moves: left once, then down twice.\n\nBut I should check if there are any apples or obstacles in between. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for me at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (3,7)\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for me at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7)\n\nRow 6: all dots\n\nRow 5: dots except for apples at (3,5) and (6,5)\n\nRow 4: all dots\n\nRow 3: dots except for apples at (3,3) and (8,3)\n\nRow 2: snake #1 at (0,2)\n\nRow 1: all dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nSo, from (7,7) to (6,5):\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n(6,7): safe\n\n(6,6): safe\n\n(6,5): apple\n\nSeems straightforward. No other snakes or apples in the way.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are shorter paths or if I might be walking into a trap. Since it's a straight path and no immediate threats, it seems acceptable.\n\nHowever, I should think about what to do after eating the apple at (6,5). Will that lead me closer to another apple or put me in a position where I can efficiently reach others?\n\nAfter eating (6,5), I'll be at (6,5) with an extended body. Let's consider the next apple to go for. The closest remaining apple would be (3,5), which is three steps to the left.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (3,5):\n\n- Left to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n(5,5): safe\n\n(4,5): safe\n\n(3,5): apple\n\nThis seems safe as well.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is closest at that point.\n\nPossible targets: (2,7), (3,3), (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (3,5) (already eaten).\n\nSo, apples left: (2,7), (3,3), (8,3).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nThat's two steps down.\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,4): safe\n\n(3,3): apple\n\nSeems okay.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut there's no apple at (3,7), but there is one at (2,7). So:\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,6): safe\n\n(3,7): safe\n\n(2,7): apple\n\nSeems feasible.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next. Going to (3,3) is closer, only two steps down, while going to (2,7) is up and left, which is three steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (3,3) first is more efficient.\n\nAfter eating (3,3), the remaining apples are at (2,7) and (8,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5) (already eaten, so it's part of my body now)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut since (3,5) is part of my body, I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or block my own path.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe it's better to go for (8,3) next, which is to the right.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\n- Right to (6,3)\n\n- Right to (7,3)\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\nThat's five steps to the right.\n\nAlternatively, going to (2,7) involves moving up and left, which is more steps.\n\nGiven that, going to (8,3) might be a better choice because it's a straight path to the right, and it's closer than (2,7).\n\nAfter eating (8,3), the only apple left is at (2,7).\n\nFrom (8,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3) (already eaten, part of my body)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (2,4)\n\n- Up to (2,5)\n\n- Up to (2,6)\n\n- Up to (2,7)\n\nThis path is longer and more complicated, and it involves passing through (3,3), which is part of my body. I need to ensure that I don't create a situation where my body blocks the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better order to eat the apples.\n\nLet me consider eating (6,5), then (3,5), then (2,7), then (3,3), and finally (8,3).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,5): left, down, down\n\nFrom (6,5) to (3,5): left, left, left\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,7): up, up, left\n\nFrom (2,7) to (3,3): down, down, down, down, right\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3): right, right, right, right, right\n\nThis seems like a logical sequence, but it might be inefficient in terms of time and risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apples in a way that minimizes the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n(7,7) -> (6,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,7) -> (3,3) -> (8,3)\n\nLet's calculate the total steps:\n\n(7,7) to (6,5):"

Every time I eat an apple, my snake grows longer, which could potentially block my own path or make turns more complicated.\n\nGiven that, I should try to keep my path as straightforward as possible, minimizing tight turns or paths that could trap me.\n\nLooking back at my initial plan:\n\n1.

Maybe there's a better way to order the apple consumption to minimize travel time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (8,3) next, since it's somewhat in line with my initial position.\n\nLet me consider an alternative path:\n\nFrom (7,8) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (8,8)\n\n- Down to (8,7)\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nThat's one right and five downs, totaling six moves.\n\nBut compared to the initial plan of four moves to (6,5), this seems longer.\n\nMoreover, after eating (8,3), I'd need to go to another apple, which might not be efficient.\n\nSo,"

Let's see which one is closest at that point.\n\nPossible targets: (2,7), (3,3), (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (3,5) (already eaten).\n\nSo, apples left: (2,7), (3,3), (8,3).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nThat's two steps down.\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,4): safe\n\n(3,3): apple\n\nSeems okay.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut there's no apple at (3,7), but there is one at (2,7). So:\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,6): safe\n\n(3,7): safe\n\n(2,7): apple\n\nSeems feasible.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next. Going to (3,3) is closer, only two steps down, while going to (2,7) is up and left, which is three steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (3,3) first is more efficient.\n\nAfter eating (3,3), the remaining apples are at (2,7) and (8,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5) (already eaten, so it's part of my body now)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut since (3,5) is part of my body, I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or block my own path.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe it's better to go for (8,3) next, which is to the right.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\n- Right to (6,3)\n\n- Right to (7,3)\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\nThat's five steps to the right.\n\nAlternatively, going to (2,7) involves moving up and left, which is more steps.\n\nGiven that, going to (8,3) might be a better choice because it's a straight path to the right, and it's closer than (2,7).\n\nAfter eating (8,3), the only apple left is at (2,7).\n\nFrom (8,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3) (already eaten, part of my body)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (2,4)\n\n- Up to (2,5)\n\n- Up to (2,6)\n\n- Up to (2,7)\n\nThis path is longer and more complicated, and it involves passing through (3,3), which is part of my body. I need to ensure that I don't create a situation where my body blocks the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better order to eat the apples.\n\nLet me consider eating (6,5), then (3,5), then (2,7), then (3,3), and finally (8,3).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,5): left, down, down\n\nFrom (6,5) to (3,5): left, left, left\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,7): up, up, left\n\nFrom (2,7) to (3,3): down, down, down, down, right\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3): right, right, right, right, right\n\nThis seems like a logical sequence, but it might be inefficient in terms of time and risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apples in a way that minimizes the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n(7,7) -> (6,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,7) -> (3,3) -> (8,3)\n\nLet's calculate the total steps:\n\n(7,7) to (6,5):"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,7). There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). Also, there's another snake, number 1, at (1,3), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to pick up these apples in the most efficient way possible, avoiding the walls, the other snake, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Rows are labeled from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top. Columns are from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (8,7), which is row 8, column 7.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,5)\n\nEnemy snake is at (1,3).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Probably the closest one to minimize the time and risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. To (6,5):\n\n|8-6| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. To (3,3):\n\n|8-3| + |7-3| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n3. To (8,3):\n\n|8-8| + |7-3| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n4. To (2,7):\n\n|8-2| + |7-7| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n5. To (3,5):\n\n|8-3| + |7-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (6,5) and (8,3), both with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to decide between (6,5) and (8,3).

There are apples at (8,3), which is directly down, and (6,5), which is down and left.\n\nIf I go to (8,3), I might be able to pick up another apple that's to the right or left, but looking at the list, the only other apple at (8,_) is (8,3) itself.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (8,3), and another at (3,3). Hmm.\n\nIf I go to (8,3), then I can look towards (3,3), which is up and left.\n\nBut that would be a longer journey.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (6,5), perhaps there are other apples nearby.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,5), the closest apple would be (3,5), which is left by three steps.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (3,3), which is down by two steps.\n\nThen to (2,7), which is up four steps and left one step.\n\nFinally, to (8,3), which is right five steps and down four steps.\n\nThat seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (8,3) first, then I can go up to (3,3), which is up five steps.\n\nThen go to (3,5), which is up two steps.\n\nThen to (6,5), which is right three steps.\n\nThen to (2,7), which is left four steps and up two steps.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the order that minimizes total movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to pick up the apples in a spiral or snaking pattern across the board.\n\nBut time is limited, so maybe I should just go for the closest one, which is (8,3), since it's directly down.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nFour moves.\n\nThen, from (8,3), I can look towards (3,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (3,5):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (6,5):\n\n- Right to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Right to (6,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nFinally, from (6,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (6,6)\n\n- Up to (6,7)\n\n- Left to (5,7)\n\n- Left to (4,7)\n\n- Left to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nThat's six moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 20 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (6,5) first:\n\nFrom (8,7) to (6,5):\n\n- Left to (7,7)\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nFour moves.\n\nThen, from (6,5) to (3,5):\n\n- Left to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nFive moves.\n\nFinally, from (2,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Right to (4,7)\n\n- Right to (5,7)\n\n- Right to (6,7)\n\n- Right to (7,7)\n\n- Right to (8,7)\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nThat's 10 moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 24 moves.\n\nSo, going to (8,3) first seems more efficient, with 20 moves versus 24 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles or if the other snake might interfere.\n\nCurrently, the other snake is at (1,3), and it's not clear if it's moving or how it will move.\n\nAssuming it's moving, I need to anticipate its path and avoid it.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with the plan to go to (8,3) first.\n\nSo, first, from (8,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nFour moves.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), my body will extend, so I need to make sure not to run into my own tail.\n\nThen, from (8,3), I'll go to (3,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\nFive moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (3,5):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (6,5):\n\n- Right to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Right to (6,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nFinally, from (6,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (6,6)\n\n- Up to (6,7)\n\n- Left to ("

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,8). There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm at (7,8), which is towards the top right of the board. There's another snake, snake #1, at (0,2), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples scattered around the board: (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I should consider which one is closest to my current position to minimize the time and risk involved in getting there.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple, since the snake can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nStarting with (6,5):\n\nDistance to (6,5):\n\n|7 - 6| + |8 - 5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext, (3,3):\n\n|7 - 3| + |8 - 3| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\nThen, (8,3):\n\n|7 - 8| + |8 - 3| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n(2,7):\n\n|7 - 2| + |8 - 7| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nAnd (3,5):\n\n|7 - 3| + |8 - 5| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,5) with a distance of 4. That seems like a good target to aim for first.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and any potential obstacles. Snake #1 is at (0,2), and since it's at the bottom left, and I'm at (7,8) in the top right, it might not be immediately threatening. However, I should keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to (6,5). Let's map out the steps:\n\nFrom (7,8) to (6,5):\n\n- Move left to (6,8)\n\n- Move down to (6,7)\n\n- Move down to (6,6)\n\n- Move down to (6,5)\n\nThat's a total of three moves: left, then down three times.\n\nBut I should check if there are any apples or obstacles in between. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for my head at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (3,7)\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for me at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (3,7)? Wait, the apple positions are (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), (3,5). So, there's an apple at (2,7), not (3,7). Maybe it's a typo in the board state.\n\nRow 6: all dots\n\nRow 5: dots except for apples at (3,5) and (6,5)\n\nRow 4: all dots\n\nRow 3: dots except for apples at (3,3) and (8,3)\n\nRow 2: snake #1 at (0,2)\n\nRow 1: all dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nSo, from (7,8) to (6,5):\n\n- Left to (6,8)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n(6,8): safe, no obstacles\n\n(6,7): safe\n\n(6,6): safe\n\n(6,5): apple\n\nSeems straightforward. No other snakes or apples in the way.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are shorter paths or if I might be walking into a trap. Since it's a straight path and no immediate threats, it seems acceptable.\n\nHowever, I should think about what to do after eating the apple at (6,5). Will that lead me closer to another apple or put me in a position where I can efficiently reach others?\n\nAfter eating (6,5), I'll be at (6,5) with an extended body. Let's consider the next apple to go for. The closest remaining apple would be (3,5), which is three steps to the left.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (3,5):\n\n- Left to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n(5,5): safe\n\n(4,5): safe\n\n(3,5): apple\n\nThis seems safe as well.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is closest at that point.\n\nPossible targets: (2,7), (3,3), (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (3,5) (already eaten).\n\nSo, (2,7) and (3,3) are options.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut wait, there's no apple at (3,7), but there is one at (2,7). So:\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,6): safe\n\n(3,7): safe\n\n(2,7): apple\n\nSeems okay.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nWhich is two steps down.\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,4): safe\n\n(3,3): apple\n\nThis is shorter, so maybe better.\n\nConsidering the positions, perhaps going for (3,3) first after (3,5) would be more efficient, as it's only two steps down.\n\nAfter eating (3,3), the remaining apples are at (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (2,7), (3,5) (eaten).\n\nSo, apples left: (8,3) and (2,7).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\n- Right to (6,3)\n\n- Right to (7,3)\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\nThat's five steps to the right.\n\nAlternatively, to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nThat's five steps up and one left.\n\nComparing the two paths, going to (8,3) is five steps to the right, while going to (2,7) is up and left.\n\nGiven that (8,3) is in the opposite direction from (2,7), it might be more efficient to choose one path over the other based on which apple is more central or which path has fewer obstacles.\n\nBut in this case, since the board is relatively open, either path could work.\n\nHowever, I need to plan this step by step, considering that I have to make moves one at a time, and I don't know how the other snake will move.\n\nAlso, I should consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, my snake grows longer, which could potentially block my own path or make turns more complicated.\n\nGiven that, I should try to keep my path as straightforward as possible, minimizing tight turns or paths that could trap me.\n\nLooking back at my initial plan:\n\n1. Go from (7,8) to (6,5)\n\n2. Then to (3,5)\n\n3. Then to (3,3)\n\n4. Then decide between (8,3) and (2,7)\n\nThis seems like a reasonable sequence, but it's a bit spread out. Maybe there's a better way to order the apple consumption to minimize travel time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (8,3) next, since it's somewhat in line with my initial position.\n\nLet me consider an alternative path:\n\nFrom (7,8) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (8,8)\n\n- Down to (8,7)\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nThat's one right and five downs, totaling six moves.\n\nBut compared to the initial plan of four moves to (6,5), this seems longer.\n\nMoreover, after eating (8,3), I'd need to go to another apple, which might not be efficient.\n\nSo,"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,7). There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm at (7,7), which is towards the top right of the board. There's another snake, snake #1, at (0,3), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples scattered around the board: (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I should consider which one is closest to my current position to minimize the time and risk involved in getting there.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple, since the snake can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nStarting with (6,5):\n\nDistance to (6,5):\n\n|7 - 6| + |7 - 5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nNext, (3,3):\n\n|7 - 3| + |7 - 3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nThen, (8,3):\n\n|7 - 8| + |7 - 3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n(2,7):\n\n|7 - 2| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\nAnd (3,5):\n\n|7 - 3| + |7 - 5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,5) with a distance of 3. That seems like a good target to aim for first.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and any potential obstacles. Snake #1 is at (0,3), and since it's at the bottom left, and I'm at (7,7) in the top right, it might not be immediately threatening. However, I should keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to (6,5). Let's map out the steps:\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,5):\n\n- Move left to (6,7)\n\n- Move down to (6,6)\n\n- Move down to (6,5)\n\nThat's a total of two moves: left once, then down twice.\n\nBut I should check if there are any apples or obstacles in between. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for me at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (3,7)\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for me at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (2,7)\n\nRow 6: all dots\n\nRow 5: dots except for apples at (3,5) and (6,5)\n\nRow 4: all dots\n\nRow 3: dots except for apples at (3,3) and (8,3)\n\nRow 2: snake #1 at (0,2)\n\nRow 1: all dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nSo, from (7,7) to (6,5):\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n(6,7): safe\n\n(6,6): safe\n\n(6,5): apple\n\nSeems straightforward. No other snakes or apples in the way.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are shorter paths or if I might be walking into a trap. Since it's a straight path and no immediate threats, it seems acceptable.\n\nHowever, I should think about what to do after eating the apple at (6,5). Will that lead me closer to another apple or put me in a position where I can efficiently reach others?\n\nAfter eating (6,5), I'll be at (6,5) with an extended body. Let's consider the next apple to go for. The closest remaining apple would be (3,5), which is three steps to the left.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (3,5):\n\n- Left to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n(5,5): safe\n\n(4,5): safe\n\n(3,5): apple\n\nThis seems safe as well.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is closest at that point.\n\nPossible targets: (2,7), (3,3), (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (3,5) (already eaten).\n\nSo, apples left: (2,7), (3,3), (8,3).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nThat's two steps down.\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,4): safe\n\n(3,3): apple\n\nSeems okay.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut there's no apple at (3,7), but there is one at (2,7). So:\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,6): safe\n\n(3,7): safe\n\n(2,7): apple\n\nSeems feasible.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next. Going to (3,3) is closer, only two steps down, while going to (2,7) is up and left, which is three steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (3,3) first is more efficient.\n\nAfter eating (3,3), the remaining apples are at (2,7) and (8,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5) (already eaten, so it's part of my body now)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut since (3,5) is part of my body, I need to make sure that I don't create a loop or block my own path.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe it's better to go for (8,3) next, which is to the right.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\n- Right to (6,3)\n\n- Right to (7,3)\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\nThat's five steps to the right.\n\nAlternatively, going to (2,7) involves moving up and left, which is more steps.\n\nGiven that, going to (8,3) might be a better choice because it's a straight path to the right, and it's closer than (2,7).\n\nAfter eating (8,3), the only apple left is at (2,7).\n\nFrom (8,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3) (already eaten, part of my body)\n\n- Left to (2,3)\n\n- Up to (2,4)\n\n- Up to (2,5)\n\n- Up to (2,6)\n\n- Up to (2,7)\n\nThis path is longer and more complicated, and it involves passing through (3,3), which is part of my body. I need to ensure that I don't create a situation where my body blocks the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better order to eat the apples.\n\nLet me consider eating (6,5), then (3,5), then (2,7), then (3,3), and finally (8,3).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,5): left, down, down\n\nFrom (6,5) to (3,5): left, left, left\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,7): up, up, left\n\nFrom (2,7) to (3,3): down, down, down, down, right\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3): right, right, right, right, right\n\nThis seems like a logical sequence, but it might be inefficient in terms of time and risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apples in a way that minimizes the total distance traveled.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n(7,7) -> (6,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,7) -> (3,3) -> (8,3)\n\nLet's calculate the total steps:\n\n(7,7) to (6,5):"

My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,7). There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5).

Rows are labeled from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top.

There are apples at (8,3), which is directly down, and (6,5), which is down and left.\n\nIf I go to (8,3), I might be able to pick up another apple that's to the right or left, but looking at the list, the only other apple at (8,_) is (8,3) itself.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (8,3), and another at (3,3). Hmm.\n\nIf I go to (8,3), then I can look towards (3,3), which is up and left.\n\nBut that would be a longer journey.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (6,5), perhaps there are other apples nearby.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,5), the closest apple would be (3,5), which is left by three steps.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (3,3), which is down by two steps.\n\nThen to (2,7), which is up four steps and left one step.\n\nFinally, to (8,3), which is right five steps and down four steps.\n\nThat seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (8,3) first, then I can go up to (3,3), which is up five steps.\n\nThen go to (3,5), which is up two steps.\n\nThen to (6,5), which is right three steps.\n\nThen to (2,7), which is left four steps and up two steps.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the order that minimizes total movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to pick up the apples in a spiral or snaking pattern across the board.\n\nBut time is limited, so maybe I should just go for the closest one, which is (8,3), since it's directly down.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nFour moves.\n\nThen, from (8,3), I can look towards (3,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (3,5):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (6,5):\n\n- Right to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Right to (6,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nFinally, from (6,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (6,6)\n\n- Up to (6,7)\n\n- Left to (5,7)\n\n- Left to (4,7)\n\n- Left to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nThat's six moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 20 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (6,5) first:\n\nFrom (8,7) to (6,5):\n\n- Left to (7,7)\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nFour moves.\n\nThen, from (6,5) to (3,5):\n\n- Left to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nFive moves.\n\nFinally, from (2,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Right to (4,7)\n\n- Right to (5,7)\n\n- Right to (6,7)\n\n- Right to (7,7)\n\n- Right to (8,7)\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nThat's 10 moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 24 moves.\n\nSo, going to (8,3) first seems more efficient, with 20 moves versus 24 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles or if the other snake might interfere.\n\nCurrently, the other snake is at (1,3), and it's not clear if it's moving or how it will move.\n\nAssuming it's moving, I need to anticipate its path and avoid it.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with the plan to go to (8,3) first.\n\nSo, first, from (8,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nFour moves.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), my body will extend, so I need to make sure not to run into my own tail.\n\nThen, from (8,3), I'll go to (3,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\nFive moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (3,5):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (6,5):\n\n- Right to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Right to (6,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nFinally, from (6,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (6,6)\n\n- Up to (6,7)\n\n- Left to ("

Since I'm currently at (0, 2), I can move up (0, 1), down (0, 3), left (1, 2), or right (2, 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. There are two apples in the reachable area: one at (2, 7) and one at (3, 5). Moving up (0, 1) would not help me reach any apples, and moving down (0, 3) would take me away from the apple at (2, 7). Moving left (1, 2) would take me closer to the apple at (2, 7), but it's further away than the apple at (3, 5). Moving right (2, 2) would take me closer to the apple at (3, 5).\n\nHowever, moving right (2, 2) would put me in the same column as enemy snake #2, which might pose a risk.

There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, right now, I'm at (7,8), which is towards the top right of the board. There's another snake, snake #1, at (0,2), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples scattered around the board: (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), and (3,5). I should consider which one is closest to my current position to minimize the time and risk involved in getting there.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple, since the snake can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nStarting with (6,5):\n\nDistance to (6,5):\n\n|7 - 6| + |8 - 5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext, (3,3):\n\n|7 - 3| + |8 - 3| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\nThen, (8,3):\n\n|7 - 8| + |8 - 3| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n(2,7):\n\n|7 - 2| + |8 - 7| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nAnd (3,5):\n\n|7 - 3| + |8 - 5| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,5) with a distance of 4. That seems like a good target to aim for first.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and any potential obstacles. Snake #1 is at (0,2), and since it's at the bottom left, and I'm at (7,8) in the top right, it might not be immediately threatening. However, I should keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the path to (6,5). Let's map out the steps:\n\nFrom (7,8) to (6,5):\n\n- Move left to (6,8)\n\n- Move down to (6,7)\n\n- Move down to (6,6)\n\n- Move down to (6,5)\n\nThat's a total of three moves: left, then down three times.\n\nBut I should check if there are any apples or obstacles in between. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for my head at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (3,7)\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots\n\nRow 8: dots except for me at (7,8)\n\nRow 7: dots except for an apple at (3,7)? Wait, the apple positions are (6,5), (3,3), (8,3), (2,7), (3,5). So, there's an apple at (2,7), not (3,7). Maybe it's a typo in the board state.\n\nRow 6: all dots\n\nRow 5: dots except for apples at (3,5) and (6,5)\n\nRow 4: all dots\n\nRow 3: dots except for apples at (3,3) and (8,3)\n\nRow 2: snake #1 at (0,2)\n\nRow 1: all dots\n\nRow 0: all dots\n\nSo, from (7,8) to (6,5):\n\n- Left to (6,8)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nLooking at these positions:\n\n(6,8): safe, no obstacles\n\n(6,7): safe\n\n(6,6): safe\n\n(6,5): apple\n\nSeems straightforward. No other snakes or apples in the way.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are shorter paths or if I might be walking into a trap. Since it's a straight path and no immediate threats, it seems acceptable.\n\nHowever, I should think about what to do after eating the apple at (6,5). Will that lead me closer to another apple or put me in a position where I can efficiently reach others?\n\nAfter eating (6,5), I'll be at (6,5) with an extended body. Let's consider the next apple to go for. The closest remaining apple would be (3,5), which is three steps to the left.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (3,5):\n\n- Left to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\nAgain, checking for obstacles:\n\n(5,5): safe\n\n(4,5): safe\n\n(3,5): apple\n\nThis seems safe as well.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can consider going for another apple. Let's see which one is closest at that point.\n\nPossible targets: (2,7), (3,3), (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (3,5) (already eaten).\n\nSo, (2,7) and (3,3) are options.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nBut wait, there's no apple at (3,7), but there is one at (2,7). So:\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,6): safe\n\n(3,7): safe\n\n(2,7): apple\n\nSeems okay.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nWhich is two steps down.\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n\n(3,4): safe\n\n(3,3): apple\n\nThis is shorter, so maybe better.\n\nConsidering the positions, perhaps going for (3,3) first after (3,5) would be more efficient, as it's only two steps down.\n\nAfter eating (3,3), the remaining apples are at (6,5) (already eaten), (8,3), (2,7), (3,5) (eaten).\n\nSo, apples left: (8,3) and (2,7).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\n- Right to (6,3)\n\n- Right to (7,3)\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\nThat's five steps to the right.\n\nAlternatively, to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nThat's five steps up and one left.\n\nComparing the two paths, going to (8,3) is five steps to the right, while going to (2,7) is up and left.\n\nGiven that (8,3) is in the opposite direction from (2,7), it might be more efficient to choose one path over the other based on which apple is more central or which path has fewer obstacles.\n\nBut in this case, since the board is relatively open, either path could work.\n\nHowever, I need to plan this step by step, considering that I have to make moves one at a time, and I don't know how the other snake will move.\n\nAlso, I should consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, my snake grows longer, which could potentially block my own path or make turns more complicated.\n\nGiven that, I should try to keep my path as straightforward as possible, minimizing tight turns or paths that could trap me.\n\nLooking back at my initial plan:\n\n1. Go from (7,8) to (6,5)\n\n2. Then to (3,5)\n\n3. Then to (3,3)\n\n4. Then decide between (8,3) and (2,7)\n\nThis seems like a reasonable sequence, but it's a bit spread out. Maybe there's a better way to order the apple consumption to minimize travel time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple at (8,3) next, since it's somewhat in line with my initial position.\n\nLet me consider an alternative path:\n\nFrom (7,8) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (8,8)\n\n- Down to (8,7)\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nThat's one right and five downs, totaling six moves.\n\nBut compared to the initial plan of four moves to (6,5), this seems longer.\n\nMoreover, after eating (8,3), I'd need to go to another apple, which might not be efficient.\n\nSo,"

Also, there's another snake, number 1, at (1,3), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to pick up these apples in the most efficient way possible, avoiding the walls, the other snake, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Rows are labeled from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top. Columns are from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, my position is (8,7), which is row 8, column 7.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (3,5)\n\nEnemy snake is at (1,3).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Probably the closest one to minimize the time and risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. To (6,5):\n\n|8-6| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. To (3,3):\n\n|8-3| + |7-3| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n3. To (8,3):\n\n|8-8| + |7-3| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n4. To (2,7):\n\n|8-2| + |7-7| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n5. To (3,5):\n\n|8-3| + |7-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (6,5) and (8,3), both with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to decide between (6,5) and (8,3). Let's look at the positions:\n\n- (6,5) is to the left and down.\n\n- (8,3) is straight down.\n\nLet's consider the paths:\n\nTo (6,5):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Left to (7,5)\n\n- Left to (6,5)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nWait, no. From (8,7):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Left to (7,5)\n\n- Left to (6,5)\n\nYes, four moves.\n\nTo (8,3):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nAlso four moves.\n\nSo, both are equally distant in terms of moves.\n\nBut perhaps one path is safer or leads me closer to other apples.\n\nLet me think about the board again. There are apples at (8,3), which is directly down, and (6,5), which is down and left.\n\nIf I go to (8,3), I might be able to pick up another apple that's to the right or left, but looking at the list, the only other apple at (8,_) is (8,3) itself.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (8,3), and another at (3,3). Hmm.\n\nIf I go to (8,3), then I can look towards (3,3), which is up and left.\n\nBut that would be a longer journey.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (6,5), perhaps there are other apples nearby.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,5), the closest apple would be (3,5), which is left by three steps.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (3,3), which is down by two steps.\n\nThen to (2,7), which is up four steps and left one step.\n\nFinally, to (8,3), which is right five steps and down four steps.\n\nThat seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (8,3) first, then I can go up to (3,3), which is up five steps.\n\nThen go to (3,5), which is up two steps.\n\nThen to (6,5), which is right three steps.\n\nThen to (2,7), which is left four steps and up two steps.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider the order that minimizes total movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim to pick up the apples in a spiral or snaking pattern across the board.\n\nBut time is limited, so maybe I should just go for the closest one, which is (8,3), since it's directly down.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nFour moves.\n\nThen, from (8,3), I can look towards (3,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (3,5):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (6,5):\n\n- Right to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Right to (6,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nFinally, from (6,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (6,6)\n\n- Up to (6,7)\n\n- Left to (5,7)\n\n- Left to (4,7)\n\n- Left to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nThat's six moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 20 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (6,5) first:\n\nFrom (8,7) to (6,5):\n\n- Left to (7,7)\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nFour moves.\n\nThen, from (6,5) to (3,5):\n\n- Left to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Left to (3,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\n- Up to (3,7)\n\n- Left to (2,7)\n\nFive moves.\n\nFinally, from (2,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Right to (4,7)\n\n- Right to (5,7)\n\n- Right to (6,7)\n\n- Right to (7,7)\n\n- Right to (8,7)\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nThat's 10 moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 24 moves.\n\nSo, going to (8,3) first seems more efficient, with 20 moves versus 24 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any obstacles or if the other snake might interfere.\n\nCurrently, the other snake is at (1,3), and it's not clear if it's moving or how it will move.\n\nAssuming it's moving, I need to anticipate its path and avoid it.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with the plan to go to (8,3) first.\n\nSo, first, from (8,7) to (8,3):\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nFour moves.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), my body will extend, so I need to make sure not to run into my own tail.\n\nThen, from (8,3), I'll go to (3,3):\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,3)\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\nFive moves.\n\nThen, from (3,3) to (3,5):\n\n- Up to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen, from (3,5) to (6,5):\n\n- Right to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Right to (6,5)\n\nThree moves.\n\nFinally, from (6,5) to (2,7):\n\n- Up to (6,6)\n\n- Up to (6,7)\n\n- Left to ("
