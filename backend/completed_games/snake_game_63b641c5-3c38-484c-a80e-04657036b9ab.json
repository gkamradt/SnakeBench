The apple at (2, 5) is particularly closer in terms of the x-axis.\n\n3. **Potential Threats/Movements**:\n   - Movement horizontally or towards y-coordinate 5 from x-coordinate 3 should be relatively safe for now, as long as I keep my distance from the other snake.\n   - Without the direction of the enemy snake's last move, I must be cautious about moving directly towards it.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\n- To move towards the closest apple, I need to decrease y-coordinate to get to apples at y=5. Simultaneously, since x=2 (apple at (2, 5)) is to the left, I also need to move horizontally towards the left.\n\n**Planning the Path:**\n- Since I'm currently at (3,9), dropping down towards y=5 (where apples are), and going towards x=2 seems sensible. At y-coordinate 8, I am still significantly above the target apples, so it's safe to move DOWN first, then consider moving LEFT next turn to be in line with the apple at (2, 5).\n\n**Final Decision**:\n- Move DOWN to begin the approach to the nearest apple and avoid any unnecessary risks or intersections with the enemy snake's potential paths. It gives me the flexibility to either continue moving DOWN next turn or adjust my movement based on new information about apple locations or enemy movements.\n\n**Next Move**: DOWN."

Although Snake #1 is at (3,9), that's not immediately in our path, and we can safely move left now. \n\nMy strategy is to start moving toward the nearest apple at (4,5) by moving left, then head down in subsequent moves until we can grab it. \n\nDecided move: LEFT."

There are other apples at (5, 3), (9, 3), and (9, 4) but they are considerably further.\n- **Enemy Snake #2**: Located at (4, 9) with no body extension.\n\n**Strategy Discussion:**\n\n1. **Safety Concerns**: Being in proximity to the enemy's head but with no body poses a lesser immediate risk. The enemy's movement is unpredictable but restricted as it cannot move into its own body.\n\n2. **Objective Approach**: Aiming to close the gap between the snake and the nearest apples on y=5.\n   \n3. **Optimal Path Analysis**:\n   - Continuing DOWN until reaching y-coordinate 5 aligns with positioning toward the apples. My current x-coordinate, x=3, situates me between both nearest apples (x=2 and x=4). Once at y=5, a slight adjustment either LEFT or RIGHT will secure an apple.\n\n4. **Threat and Opportunity Balancing**: Movement should consider maximizing apple intake while minimizing potential confrontations with Snake #2. Given Snake #2's last observed position and no noted movement, high precision in tracking their likely path is tricky - maintaining flexibility in response is key.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\n- Proceed DOWN again to move directly toward the y-coordinate level of the nearest apples. This trajectory is both the shortest path to a food source and avoids any direct routes towards the enemy snake\u2019s last known position.\n\n**Planning the Path**:\n- Once at y=6, evaluate the relative x-positions to decide whether to drift LEFT to x=2 for the apple placed at (2, 5), or stay the course towards the more central apple at (4, 5).\n\n**Final Decision**:\n- Commit to moving DOWN again while observing the enemy\u2019s movements.

Both are conveniently one unit down and slightly to the left or right, respectively. \n\n- **Enemy Snake #2**: Last known position at (4, 8). Given this position, it's unlikely that the snake would directly interfere with my current pursuit unless it decides to move drastically south.\n\n- **Path Planning**: With apples just one row below at the y-coordinate 5, I should carefully plan to position myself to either collect the apple at (2,5) or (4,5) in the subsequent moves after reaching the 5th y-coordinate.\n\n- **Immediate Threats**: There seem to be no immediate walls or body collisions expected if I continue the path DOWN.\n\n- **Potential Next Moves**:\n  - Moving DOWN this turn allows me to reach y=5.\n  - From y=5, decisions can be made based on enemy snake's position and closest apple alignments to tactically choose either LEFT to (2,5) or RIGHT to (4,5).\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\n- Execute moving DOWN to y=5 to align on the same y-coordinate as the nearest apples. \n- For the next turn (after reaching y=5), carefully assessing the environment will be crucial to decide whether to go LEFT to snatch (2, 5) or RIGHT towards (4, 5).\n\n**Next Move**: DOWN."

Both moves are safe without immediate threats in current surroundings.\n\n**Next Turn Considerations**:\n- As both apples are equidistant and reachable, I should prioritize the apple that presents less competition and leaves options open for further strategic moves.\n- Observing where the enemy snake moves after I pick an apple will be crucial for planning subsequent turns.\n\n**Next Move**: \n- Given that moving RIGHT often presents a strategically advantageous position due to keeping close to the board's center, I choose to move RIGHT to collect the apple at (4, 5).
