Moving towards this apple would be a good strategy to gain a point and grow my snake.\n\nHowever, I need to be mindful of the enemy snake's position at (5, 1). While the enemy snake is not directly in my path, I should avoid getting too close to it to prevent any potential collisions.\n\nConsidering the current position of my snake at (2, 7) and the location of the nearest apple, the best move for this turn would be to go LEFT. This will bring me closer to the apple at (3, 4) while also maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nNext turn, I might consider moving towards the apple at (0, 2) or the one at (0, 9) to continue growing my snake and increasing my score. I'll also keep a close eye on the enemy snake's position and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
