            "rationale": "Let's evaluate my current situation again before deciding on my next move:\n\n### Position Recap:\n- **My Position:** (1, 7)\n- **Apples Remaining:** (8, 4), (8, 2), (5, 0), (1, 4)\n- **Enemy Snake:** at (8, 4) with body segments [(8, 5), (8, 6)]\n\n### Possible Moves From (1, 7):\n1. **UP to (1, 8):** This position is where I just was. Moving back doesn't gain any ground.\n2. **DOWN to (1, 6):** This cell is empty. It keeps distance from the enemy snake but doesn't lead me closer to any apples.\n3. **LEFT to (0, 7):** This is an open space, similar in benefits to moving down.\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 7):** Also an empty space, keeping me away from enemy territory.\n\n### Evaluating the Moves:\n- **UP (1, 8):** Regressing to where I was is not advantageous.\n- **DOWN (1, 6):** Keeps me away from the enemy but may lead me farther from potential apples.\n- **LEFT (0, 7):** A safe move, maintains my position without risking proximity to the enemy.\n- **RIGHT (2, 7):** Also a safe move with no immediate risks.\n\n### Apples Count and Enemy Constraints:\nThe apple at **(1, 4)** is reachable if I make targeted moves down the row but getting close to the **(8, 4)** apple is a challenge because of the enemy snake. \n\n### Best Strategic Move:\nThe goal is to maximize point gain while minimizing risk. Moving LEFT will allow me to position myself and potentially move toward the apple at (1, 4) in future moves, while moving to (2, 7) doesn\u2019t offer a clear path to any apples. \n\nIn summary, moving LEFT to (0, 7) keeps my options open without danger, positioning me effectively for future moves.\n\n### Decision:\nI choose to move **LEFT** to (0, 7). \n\nThe subsequent strategy is to keep available the option to move down towards (1, 4) or back towards (1, 6) either by going left again or continuing to navigate without getting cornered by the enemy. Staying adaptable is key as the enemy\u2019s movements can change how I approach my next apple."

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "Firstly, let's reevaluate the position after taking into account the referred 'last move' direction, which was DOWN. Currently and as mentioned in the previous context, the snake is located at (8, 3). Thus, after moving DOWN from (8, 3), the snake should now be at (8, 2).\n\nUpon arriving at (8, 2), an apple is present there according to the apple positions given, which means the snake will consume the apple and grow. \n\nThe considerations that follow consuming the apple at (8, 2) include avoiding the bottom wall (since any further DOWN movement would lead to death due to crashing into the wall), as well as making a strategic choice for the next direction. LEFT or RIGHT seem to be the viable options:\n\n1. Moving LEFT after consuming the apple at (8,2) doesn't provide any immediate advantage as there are no nearby apples in that immediate trajectory.\n2. Moving RIGHT after consuming the apple at (8,2) could be strategically better as it keeps the snake toward the middle of the board, potentially opening up access to the central parts of the board where movement options are more numerous.\n\n#### Decided Next Move for This Turn: \nSince the 'last move' context states the snake's intention was to collect the apple at (8, 2) by moving DOWN and considering this apple will be consumed on this turn, the immediate next move should consider future options post-apple consumption.\n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn Post-Apple Collection:\nHaving consumed the apple at (8,2), I should then look to the best next strategic step for staying alive while maximizing future points. Moving RIGHT seems the optimal next step to stay flexible and avoid the boundary walls.\n\n#### Decided Next Move: DOWN to collect the apple at (8, 2). For the subsequent move, consider moving RIGHT depending on the updated board state."
