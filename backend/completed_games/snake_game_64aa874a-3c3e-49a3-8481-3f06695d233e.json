Moving here allows you to collect it, gaining 1 point and potentially increasing your snake's length.\n   - **Strategic Advantage:** Collecting an apple provides a direct advantage.

However, it might limit immediate options for transitioning towards higher y-coordinates.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n   - **Safety:** The space to the right is clear; no immediate threats.\n   - **Proximity to Apples:** Moving right brings the snake closer to the apple at (8, 1).
