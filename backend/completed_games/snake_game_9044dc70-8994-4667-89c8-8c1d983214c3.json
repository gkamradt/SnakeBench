I could attempt to position myself to where I can box it in or make it run into me. But, that strategy is also high risk for me: if I don't manage to box it in and I got too close, it might end up getting me instead. It's not too close to me right now. If it doesn't come too close, I rather try not to engage with it.\n\nThe nearest apple to me right now is at (4, 8), which is one space to my right and same level on the y-axis. Other apples are a bit further away, so I should consider moving right to get a quick snack.\n\nBut I should also put myself in a good position to get the other apples after I eat this one.

This path will incrementally decrease distance to the apple while keeping a relatively safe distance from the enemy snake #2, which isn't currently blocking the path downwards.\n\nOther Considerations:\n- By moving DOWN to (8,3), then again to (8,2), and finally to (8,1), I can effectively collect the apple while maintaining a relatively safe distance from any potential threats.\n\nImmediate Threats:\n- Patrolling and tracking the movement of snake #2 is essential. Should it descend its direction or appear likely to intersect with my path, I will need to reassess my strategy and possibly consider altering my route or avoiding any imminent confrontation.\n\nFuture Strategy:\n- Upon successful collection of the apple at (8,1), consider targeting next closest apple. An evaluation of other snakes' positions and potential threats will be critical to determine my subsequent moves.\n\nDecided Next Move:\n- DOWN, heading towards the apple located at (8,1), while keeping an eye on snake #2's movements for necessary adjustments in future turns."

Instead, moving LEFT first will give me additional space to maneuver my snake, allowing me to retain the positional advantage and keeping my options open for the next turns. It also gets me slightly closer towards the (7,1) apple.\n\nThe strategy for the next turn is to check whether the enemy snake moved up or not. If it remains where it is or moves down, I can continue to approach the (7,1) apple. If it does ascend, I should move up in order to maintain distance from it.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

Since it\u2019s relatively far and potentially moving away but still something to track, no immediate threat is posed by this snake crossing my path towards the apple at (8,1).\n\nImmediate Strategy:\n- Continuing DOWN remains the best strategy. This will take me to the apple at (8,1) without interference. Collecting this apple will gain an additional point and increase my size, enhancing the possibility of securing more apples available on the board.\n\nConsiderations for Future Strategy:\n- Post collecting the apple at (8,1), evaluate the new positions of enemies and potential routes to the next closest apples. Given the availability of apples at (2,4), (3,2), and (4,9), planning a strategic route avoiding enemy encroachments is crucial.\n- Always maintain a buffer space between my snake and the enemy to prevent any unexpected collisions.\n\nDecided Next Move:\n- Continue moving DOWN to collect the apple at (8,1), and keep vigilant observation of snake #2 movements.

This will increase size and points.\n\nPost Apple Consideration:\n- After collecting the apple at (8,1), review board state to determine the safest route either going for the next closest apple or repositioning. The board\u2019s upper quadrant holds another apple at (4,9) but requires crossing the board, which might need careful path planning especially regarding Snake #2 movements.\n\nLong-Term Strategy:\n- Continuously update on Snake #2's movements and other potential new threats. Map routes that minimize risk of collision, while maximizing apple collection.\n\nDecided Next Move:\n- Confirmed move is DOWN to collect the apple at (8,1). This decision is based on current safety and direct path to an immediate gain.
