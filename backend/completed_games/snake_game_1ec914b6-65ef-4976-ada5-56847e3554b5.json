Prioritizing movements that bring us closer to these areas can maximize our point gain.\n  \n- **Enemy Snake Position:** The enemy snake is at (5, 9), which is relatively distant. Currently, there's no immediate threat, allowing us to focus on apple collection without significant risk.\n\n- **Flexibility:** Maintaining the ability to change direction based on the evolving game state is crucial. Avoiding positions that restrict movement can be advantageous in the long run.\n\n**Decision:**\n- **Moving DOWN** positions us closer to several apples and keeps us within the central area of the board, offering flexibility for future moves. While it slightly reduces vertical space, the benefits of proximity to multiple apples outweigh this concern.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"
