            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and where everything is.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (9,1). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (6,9) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (3,8), (1,4), (4,8), (8,2), and (4,9).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see the apples are spread out. The one at (4,9) is near the top middle, which is close to the enemy snake at (6,9). The apple at (8,2) is on the lower right side, and (1,4) is on the left side. The others are at (3,8) and (4,8), which are on the upper left and middle.\n\nMy snake is at (9,1), which is near the bottom right. The last move was None, so I'm just starting or resuming. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying, which means I need to avoid walls, other snakes, and my own body.\n\nLet me think about possible moves. From (9,1), I can move up, left, or down. Wait, down from (9,1) would take me to (9,0), which is still within the board. But moving down might not be the best because it's towards the bottom, and there are no apples directly below me. Alternatively, moving left would take me to (8,1), which is still in the same row but closer to the center. Moving up would take me to (9,2), which is also a valid move.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one to me is at (8,2). That's two steps to the left and one step up. So if I move left twice and up once, I can reach that apple. Alternatively, the apple at (4,8) is further away, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference from the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (6,9). Since it's just the head there, and its body is empty, it's not a threat right now. But I should keep an eye on it in case it moves towards me.\n\nSo, focusing on the nearest apple at (8,2). Let me plan the path. From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's two moves. But I can only make one move at a time. So my first move should be towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (4,9). It's at the top middle, but that's quite a distance. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left multiple times. But that's a longer path, and I might get intercepted by the enemy snake or run into myself if I'm not careful.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (1,4). That's on the left side, but again, it's quite a distance. Maybe not the best target right now.\n\nSo, the apple at (8,2) seems the most accessible. Let me check if moving left from (9,1) is safe. The cell (8,1) is empty, as per the board state. So moving left is safe. Then, from (8,1), moving up to (8,2) would collect the apple.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (8,2), so moving up from (8,1) would take me to (8,2), which is the apple. So that's a two-move plan. But I can only make one move now. So my first move should be left to (8,1).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move up first to (9,2), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving left seems better.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, the apple at (8,2) is at column 8, row 2. So from (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's correct.\n\nBut I should also check if moving left from (9,1) is safe. The cell (8,1) is empty, so yes. Also, moving left won't cause me to collide with myself because my body is only at (9,1) right now, assuming I just started or my body is not present in the current state.\n\nWait, the board state shows that my snake is at (9,1), and the enemy is at (6,9). There's no mention of my body, so I'm probably just the head there, and the rest is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (8,1) is the first step towards collecting the apple at (8,2). Alternatively, maybe I can go for another apple if it's more beneficial, but the one at (8,2) seems the most immediate.\n\nWait, another thought: the apple at (4,8) is also nearby. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on. But that's a longer path, and I might not reach it before the enemy snake does, especially since it's closer to (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the apple at (4,9), which is at the top middle. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on until I reach (4,9). But that's a lot of moves, and I might get intercepted.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,9) is only four columns to the left from (8,9). So if I can get to (8,9), I can move left to (7,9), etc., but I'm starting at (9,1). So it's a longer path.\n\nI think the best immediate move is to go for the apple at (8,2). So moving left to (8,1) is the first step.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the coordinates. The board shows that row 9 is the top, so moving up increases y, and moving down decreases y. So from (9,1), moving up would take me to (9,2), which is one step up. Moving left would take me to (8,1).\n\nYes, that's correct. So moving left to (8,1) is the first step towards (8,2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move up first to (9,2), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving left is better.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is lower than my current position. So moving up from (9,1) would take me towards row 2, but I'm already at row 1. Wait, no, row 9 is the top, so row 1 is just below that. So moving up from (9,1) would take me to (9,2), which is higher up, but the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is lower than my current position. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the coordinate system. The board is from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So increasing y goes up, decreasing y goes down. So (9,1) is near the top right, just one row down from (9,9). The apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is two rows down from the top. So to get to (8,2), I need to move down from (9,1).\n\nWait, that's a mistake I made earlier. So from (9,1), moving down would take me to (9,0), which is further down. But the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is higher up than row 1. Wait, no, row 9 is the top, so row 1 is just below that, and row 0 is the bottom. So row 2 is two rows below row 9, which is the top. So (8,2) is in row 2, which is lower than my current position at (9,1). So to get there, I need to move down.\n\nWait, that changes everything. So from (9,1), moving down would take me to (9,0), which is further down, but the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is higher up. Wait, no, row 2 is lower than row 1 because row 9 is the top. So row 1 is just below row 9, and row 2 is below row 1. So moving down from (9,1) would take me to (9,0), which is further down, but the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is higher than row 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm getting confused with the coordinate system. Let me visualize it again. The board is a grid where (0,0) is the bottom left, and (9,9) is the top right. So y increases as you go up. So (9,1) is one row below (9,9). The apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is two rows below (9,9). So to get to (8,2), I need to move down from (9,1) to (9,0), then left to (8,0), then up to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move left first to (8,1), then down to (8,0), then left to (7,0), etc. But that seems inefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (4,8). That's in row 8, which is near the top. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on until I reach (4,8). That's a longer path, but maybe more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (4,9) is at the very top. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on until I reach (4,9). That's even further.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize the apple at (8,2) because it's the closest. But given the coordinate confusion, I need to clarify.\n\nLet me think again: (9,1) is near the top right. The apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is two rows below the top. So to get there, I need to move down from (9,1) to (9,0), then left to (8,0), then up to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,1), then down to (8,0), then left to (7,0), etc., but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should just move towards the nearest apple, regardless of the path. The apple at (8,2) is the closest, so I should go for that.\n\nBut considering the movement, from (9,1), moving left to (8,1) is safe. Then, from (8,1), moving up to (8,2) would collect the apple. So that's two moves. But I can only make one move now. So moving left is the first step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move up to (9,2), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving left is better.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,1), then next move I can move up to (8,2) to collect the apple. That seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I should also check if the enemy snake is a threat. It's at (6,9), which is on the top middle. Since it's only the head and no body, it's not blocking my path. So I can proceed safely.\n\nAnother consideration: when I move, I have to make sure I don't run into my own body. Since I'm just starting, my body is empty, so that's not an issue. But as I grow, I'll have to be careful.\n\nSo, to sum up, the best move is to go left to (8,1), then up to (8,2) to collect the apple. So my first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nThe best move is to go left to (8,1) to start moving towards the nearest apple at (8,2). \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

The closest apple to me is at (4, 9), which is just one step away. If I move up, I'll run into the wall, so that's not an option. Moving down would take me away from the apples, so that's not ideal either. Moving left would put me closer to the apple at (4, 9), so that's a good option.\n\nMy strategy for next turn will be to try to get to the apple at (3, 8) or (1, 4) to maximize my points.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

That's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move left first to (8,1), then down to (8,0), then left to (7,0), etc. But that seems inefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (4,8). That's in row 8, which is near the top. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on until I reach (4,8). That's a longer path, but maybe more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (4,9) is at the very top. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on until I reach (4,9). That's even further.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize the apple at (8,2) because it's the closest. But given the coordinate confusion, I need to clarify.\n\nLet me think again: (9,1) is near the top right. The apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is two rows below the top. So to get there, I need to move down from (9,1) to (9,0), then left to (8,0), then up to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,1), then down to (8,0), then left to (7,0), etc., but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should just move towards the nearest apple, regardless of the path. The apple at (8,2) is the closest, so I should go for that.\n\nBut considering the movement, from (9,1), moving left to (8,1) is safe. Then, from (8,1), moving up to (8,2) would collect the apple. So that's two moves. But I can only make one move now. So moving left is the first step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move up to (9,2), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving left is better.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,1), then next move I can move up to (8,2) to collect the apple. That seems like a good plan.\n\nBut I should also check if the enemy snake is a threat. It's at (6,9), which is on the top middle. Since it's only the head and no body, it's not blocking my path. So I can proceed safely.\n\nAnother consideration: when I move, I have to make sure I don't run into my own body. Since I'm just starting, my body is empty, so that's not an issue. But as I grow, I'll have to be careful.\n\nSo, to sum up, the best move is to go left to (8,1), then up to (8,2) to collect the apple. So my first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nThe best move is to go left to (8,1) to start moving towards the nearest apple at (8,2). \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and where everything is.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (9,1). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (6,9) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (3,8), (1,4), (4,8), (8,2), and (4,9).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see the apples are spread out. The one at (4,9) is near the top middle, which is close to the enemy snake at (6,9). The apple at (8,2) is on the lower right side, and (1,4) is on the left side. The others are at (3,8) and (4,8), which are on the upper left and middle.\n\nMy snake is at (9,1), which is near the bottom right. The last move was None, so I'm just starting or resuming. My goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying, which means I need to avoid walls, other snakes, and my own body.\n\nLet me think about possible moves. From (9,1), I can move up, left, or down. Wait, down from (9,1) would take me to (9,0), which is still within the board. But moving down might not be the best because it's towards the bottom, and there are no apples directly below me. Alternatively, moving left would take me to (8,1), which is still in the same row but closer to the center. Moving up would take me to (9,2), which is also a valid move.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one to me is at (8,2). That's two steps to the left and one step up. So if I move left twice and up once, I can reach that apple. Alternatively, the apple at (4,8) is further away, but maybe it's worth considering if I can get there without interference from the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (6,9). Since it's just the head there, and its body is empty, it's not a threat right now. But I should keep an eye on it in case it moves towards me.\n\nSo, focusing on the nearest apple at (8,2). Let me plan the path. From (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's two moves. But I can only make one move at a time. So my first move should be towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (4,9). It's at the top middle, but that's quite a distance. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left multiple times. But that's a longer path, and I might get intercepted by the enemy snake or run into myself if I'm not careful.\n\nAnother option is the apple at (1,4). That's on the left side, but again, it's quite a distance. Maybe not the best target right now.\n\nSo, the apple at (8,2) seems the most accessible. Let me check if moving left from (9,1) is safe. The cell (8,1) is empty, as per the board state. So moving left is safe. Then, from (8,1), moving up to (8,2) would collect the apple.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (8,2), so moving up from (8,1) would take me to (8,2), which is the apple. So that's a two-move plan. But I can only make one move now. So my first move should be left to (8,1).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move up first to (9,2), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving left seems better.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, the apple at (8,2) is at column 8, row 2. So from (9,1), moving left to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's correct.\n\nBut I should also check if moving left from (9,1) is safe. The cell (8,1) is empty, so yes. Also, moving left won't cause me to collide with myself because my body is only at (9,1) right now, assuming I just started or my body is not present in the current state.\n\nWait, the board state shows that my snake is at (9,1), and the enemy is at (6,9). There's no mention of my body, so I'm probably just the head there, and the rest is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nSo, moving left to (8,1) is the first step towards collecting the apple at (8,2). Alternatively, maybe I can go for another apple if it's more beneficial, but the one at (8,2) seems the most immediate.\n\nWait, another thought: the apple at (4,8) is also nearby. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on. But that's a longer path, and I might not reach it before the enemy snake does, especially since it's closer to (6,9).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize the apple at (4,9), which is at the top middle. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on until I reach (4,9). But that's a lot of moves, and I might get intercepted.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,9) is only four columns to the left from (8,9). So if I can get to (8,9), I can move left to (7,9), etc., but I'm starting at (9,1). So it's a longer path.\n\nI think the best immediate move is to go for the apple at (8,2). So moving left to (8,1) is the first step.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the coordinates. The board shows that row 9 is the top, so moving up increases y, and moving down decreases y. So from (9,1), moving up would take me to (9,2), which is one step up. Moving left would take me to (8,1).\n\nYes, that's correct. So moving left to (8,1) is the first step towards (8,2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move up first to (9,2), but that doesn't get me closer to any apple. So moving left is better.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is lower than my current position. So moving up from (9,1) would take me towards row 2, but I'm already at row 1. Wait, no, row 9 is the top, so row 1 is just below that. So moving up from (9,1) would take me to (9,2), which is higher up, but the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is lower than my current position. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the coordinate system. The board is from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So increasing y goes up, decreasing y goes down. So (9,1) is near the top right, just one row down from (9,9). The apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is two rows down from the top. So to get to (8,2), I need to move down from (9,1).\n\nWait, that's a mistake I made earlier. So from (9,1), moving down would take me to (9,0), which is further down. But the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is higher up than row 1. Wait, no, row 9 is the top, so row 1 is just below that, and row 0 is the bottom. So row 2 is two rows below row 9, which is the top. So (8,2) is in row 2, which is lower than my current position at (9,1). So to get there, I need to move down.\n\nWait, that changes everything. So from (9,1), moving down would take me to (9,0), which is further down, but the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is higher up. Wait, no, row 2 is lower than row 1 because row 9 is the top. So row 1 is just below row 9, and row 2 is below row 1. So moving down from (9,1) would take me to (9,0), which is further down, but the apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is higher than row 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm getting confused with the coordinate system. Let me visualize it again. The board is a grid where (0,0) is the bottom left, and (9,9) is the top right. So y increases as you go up. So (9,1) is one row below (9,9). The apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is two rows below (9,9). So to get to (8,2), I need to move down from (9,1) to (9,0), then left to (8,0), then up to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move left first to (8,1), then down to (8,0), then left to (7,0), etc. But that seems inefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (4,8). That's in row 8, which is near the top. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on until I reach (4,8). That's a longer path, but maybe more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (4,9) is at the very top. From (9,1), moving up to (9,2), then left to (8,2), then up to (8,3), and so on until I reach (4,9). That's even further.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize the apple at (8,2) because it's the closest. But given the coordinate confusion, I need to clarify.\n\nLet me think again: (9,1) is near the top right. The apple at (8,2) is in row 2, which is two rows below the top. So to get there, I need to move down from (9,1) to (9,0), then left to (8,0), then up to (8,1), then up to (8,2). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,1), then down to (8,0), then left to (7,0), etc., but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.
