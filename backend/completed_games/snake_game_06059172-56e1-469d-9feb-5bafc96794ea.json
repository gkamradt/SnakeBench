Avoidance of conflicts with snake #2 or walls remains a priority. \n\n4. **Rest of the Game Plan**:\n   - With the growing body (and therefore additional weight), maneuverability decreases, necessitating a keen eye on potential traps or being cornered.\n   - Keep watching the enemy snake's trajectory, especially since it is placed on the upper half closer to our target area.\n   - Be alert for any new apple spawns elsewhere on the board; prioritize reachable apples while maintaining safe routing.\n\n5. **Long-term Strategy**: Post-consuming nearby apples, reevaluate strategy for apple collection based on new apple positions as well as relative positions of enemy snake.\n\nGiven we are clear about the neighboring apple positions directly adjacent above and no immediate threats, the next logical and safest move:\n\n**Decided next move: UP** (to move to (6, 2) and consume the apple)."

You have indicated that moving up during the last turn was part of the strategy to get to consecutive apples located at (6, 2) and (6, 3). Currently, the immediate apple at (6, 2) can be reached by just one more move UP.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake Position & Strategy**: Enemy snake (#2) is at (2, 7). With no body segments shown, it poses less immediate risk to our path towards the apples, although its future movements should be monitored to avoid direct conflicts.\n\n3. **Next Moves & Strategy**:\n   - **Immediate Next Move**: Moving UP to (6, 2) will allow us to eat the apple positioned there, which aligns with the strategy to accumulate points and grow.\n   - **Subsequent Strategy**: After consuming the apple at (6, 2), a further UP move will be ideal to consume the next apple at (6, 3), unless influenced by any new developments on the board. Avoidance of conflicts with snake #2 or walls remains a priority. \n\n4. **Rest of the Game Plan**:\n   - With the growing body (and therefore additional weight), maneuverability decreases, necessitating a keen eye on potential traps or being cornered.\n   - Keep watching the enemy snake's trajectory, especially since it is placed on the upper half closer to our target area.\n   - Be alert for any new apple spawns elsewhere on the board; prioritize reachable apples while maintaining safe routing.\n\n5. **Long-term Strategy**: Post-consuming nearby apples, reevaluate strategy for apple collection based on new apple positions as well as relative positions of enemy snake.\n\nGiven we are clear about the neighboring apple positions directly adjacent above and no immediate threats, the next logical and safest move:\n\n**Decided next move: UP** (to move to (6, 2) and consume the apple)."

Approaching and consuming it remains a priority since it is unguarded and directly accessible.\n\n**Enemy Snake Consideration:**\n- Snake #2, located at (2, 6), poses no immediate threat to my current objective or path.\n\n**Safety and Obstacle Review:**\n- My immediate path downwards (DOWN) to (8, 8) where the apple is situated offers no obstacle nor danger from enemy interactions or wall collisions. \n\n**Post-Consumption Plan:**\n- Once the apple at (8, 8) is consumed, the nearest next targets will be the apples at (6, 5) or (4, 4). The direct path from (8, 8) towards these apples should be plotted ensuring efficiency in movement, and safety considering distances from walls and opponent's likely movements. Moving towards (6, 5) seems to be a strategic choice since it's closer than moving to the central (4, 4).\n\nFor this move, the decision is straightforward due to the direct safety and the location of the apple:\n- Move DOWN to consume the apple at (8, 8), grow my snake, and gain a point. Post this, a quick reassessment of the surroundings and potential movements of both my snake and the enemy will be essential for future strategy development.\n\n**Next Move Decision**: DOWN"

The direct path from (8, 8) towards these apples should be plotted ensuring efficiency in movement, and safety considering distances from walls and opponent's likely movements.

Post this, a quick reassessment of the surroundings and potential movements of both my snake and the enemy will be essential for future strategy development.\n\n**Next Move Decision**: DOWN"
