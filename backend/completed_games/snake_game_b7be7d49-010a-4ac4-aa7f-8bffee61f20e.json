There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n\nSo, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0). Wait, but earlier it was said apples are at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), (4,4). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are towards the top, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,3). Wait, in the last move information, it says I was at (4,2), but according to the board state, I'm at (4,3). Maybe I moved up since the last turn. Okay, so I'm at (4,3).\n\nThere are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (8,1) with its body at [], which probably means it's just the head with no body parts yet.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots except possibly the apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: apple at (4,4).\n\nRow 3: me at (4,3).\n\nRow 2: dot.\n\nRow 1: enemy at (8,1) and apple at (9,1).\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nSo, my position is (4,3), and I need to decide where to go next.\n\nMy last move was up, from (4,2) to (4,3), aiming to get to the apples directly above me at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nThat seems like a good plan because those apples are right in line with my current position, and there don't seem to be any immediate obstacles.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy snake. It's at (8,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it starts moving upwards, it might eventually cross my path, but for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, after eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving to other apples. The apple at (5,8) seems fairly distant, and there are apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0), but the enemy is already near there.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the central area for now, secure those apples, and then decide what to do next.\n\nSo, continuing from (4,3), moving up to (4,4), eating the apple, then to (4,5), eating that one too.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving right to column 5 and going up to (5,8).\n\nAlternatively, I could look towards the apples in the bottom right, but that might put me in direct competition with the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, sticking to the central area seems safer for now.\n\nI should also be aware of my own body as I grow longer. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in or make sharp turns that could cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSo, for this turn, since I'm at (4,3), and the apple is at (4,4) directly above me, I should move up to (4,4).\n\nThen, in the next turn, I can eat the apple at (4,5).\n\nAfter that, I'll need to decide whether to move right to column 5 and go up to (5,8), or maybe head towards the bottom right corner.\n\nBut for now, moving up seems like the safest and most straightforward choice.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's position and movements.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n\nSo, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0). Wait, but earlier it was said apples are at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), (4,4). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

Then, after eating that apple, I can consider my options again.\n\nBut I should also think a few steps ahead. After eating (4,5), what's next?\n\nIf I move up from (4,5) to (4,6), there's no apple there. So, maybe I should consider moving right to (5,5), but there's no apple there either. Alternatively, I could move to (4,6) and then to (5,6), where there's an apple at (5,8), but that's further up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right. Maybe I should adjust my path to include that apple.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (4,6).\n\n- Move right to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Then, maybe move up to (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9), but there are no apples there, as far as I can see.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move right to (5,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nOption 3:\n\n- Move right to (5,4).\n\n- Move up to (5,5), (5,6), etc.\n\nBut, considering that I need to be cautious of the enemy, and also of my own growing length, perhaps sticking to vertical movement for now is safer.\n\nAlso, moving right from (4,4) to (5,4) might not be the best idea because there's no immediate apple there, and I might be moving away from the apples at (4,5) and (6,6).\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is two rows down and two columns to the right from my current position.\n\nSo, perhaps a better plan is to move up to (4,5), eat the apple, then move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, I can consider moving to (5,7), (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or my own tail in the process.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down from (4,4) to (4,3), but that's where my tail is, and if I move down further, I might get boxed in.\n\nWait, no, my tail is at (4,3), and since I've grown by eating the apple at (4,4), my tail might have moved, but according to the board, it's still at (4,3).\n\nActually, when you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, and your snake grows by adding a new segment in the direction you're moving.\n\nWait, no, in classic Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays, and you don't lose segments unless you move into a wall or yourself.\n\nBut in this game, since there are multiple apples, and you can grow multiple times, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, after eating the apple at (4,4), my snake has grown, so I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving up to (4,5) seems safe.\n\nThen, from (4,5), moving up to (4,6), which is empty, then right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), where there's an apple at (6,6).\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (6,6), which is two rows down from (4,4).\n\nActually, looking back, the apple positions are:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nSo, from (4,4), up to (4,5), eat the apple, then up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is at row 6, column 6.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), but the apple is at (6,6), which is down from there.\n\nWait, no, if I'm at (5,5), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6) to get the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a better plan is to stay in the central area, eat the apples at (4,5) and (6,6), and then head towards (5,8).\n\nBut, moving from (4,5) to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (6,6) seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving down from (4,5) to (4,4), but that's where I just came from, and I don't want to go back because I might hit my own body.\n\nWait, no, since I've grown, my body is now at (4,3), and possibly (4,2), depending on how much I've grown.\n\nActually, every time I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my tail stays, and I don't lose segments.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is.\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- Me at (4,4)\n\n- Tail at (4,3)\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (4,3), and a new segment will be added where I was before eating, which is (4,4).\n\nSo, after eating (4,5), my snake will be at (4,5), (4,4), and (4,3).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,6), I'm safe.\n\nThen, I can move right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, the apple is"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n\nSo, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0). Wait, but earlier it was said apples are at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), (4,4). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

It's at (8,1), which is below and to the right of me.

Then, after eating that apple, I can consider my options again.\n\nBut I should also think a few steps ahead. After eating (4,5), what's next?\n\nIf I move up from (4,5) to (4,6), there's no apple there. So, maybe I should consider moving right to (5,5), but there's no apple there either. Alternatively, I could move to (4,6) and then to (5,6), where there's an apple at (5,8), but that's further up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right. Maybe I should adjust my path to include that apple.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (4,6).\n\n- Move right to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Then, maybe move up to (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9), but there are no apples there, as far as I can see.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move right to (5,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nOption 3:\n\n- Move right to (5,4).\n\n- Move up to (5,5), (5,6), etc.\n\nBut, considering that I need to be cautious of the enemy, and also of my own growing length, perhaps sticking to vertical movement for now is safer.\n\nAlso, moving right from (4,4) to (5,4) might not be the best idea because there's no immediate apple there, and I might be moving away from the apples at (4,5) and (6,6).\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is two rows down and two columns to the right from my current position.\n\nSo, perhaps a better plan is to move up to (4,5), eat the apple, then move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, I can consider moving to (5,7), (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or my own tail in the process.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down from (4,4) to (4,3), but that's where my tail is, and if I move down further, I might get boxed in.\n\nWait, no, my tail is at (4,3), and since I've grown by eating the apple at (4,4), my tail might have moved, but according to the board, it's still at (4,3).\n\nActually, when you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, and your snake grows by adding a new segment in the direction you're moving.\n\nWait, no, in classic Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays, and you don't lose segments unless you move into a wall or yourself.\n\nBut in this game, since there are multiple apples, and you can grow multiple times, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, after eating the apple at (4,4), my snake has grown, so I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving up to (4,5) seems safe.\n\nThen, from (4,5), moving up to (4,6), which is empty, then right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), where there's an apple at (6,6).\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (6,6), which is two rows down from (4,4).\n\nActually, looking back, the apple positions are:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nSo, from (4,4), up to (4,5), eat the apple, then up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is at row 6, column 6.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), but the apple is at (6,6), which is down from there.\n\nWait, no, if I'm at (5,5), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6) to get the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a better plan is to stay in the central area, eat the apples at (4,5) and (6,6), and then head towards (5,8).\n\nBut, moving from (4,5) to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (6,6) seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving down from (4,5) to (4,4), but that's where I just came from, and I don't want to go back because I might hit my own body.\n\nWait, no, since I've grown, my body is now at (4,3), and possibly (4,2), depending on how much I've grown.\n\nActually, every time I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my tail stays, and I don't lose segments.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is.\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- Me at (4,4)\n\n- Tail at (4,3)\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (4,3), and a new segment will be added where I was before eating, which is (4,4).\n\nSo, after eating (4,5), my snake will be at (4,5), (4,4), and (4,3).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,6), I'm safe.\n\nThen, I can move right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, the apple is"

Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n\nSo, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0). Wait, but earlier it was said apples are at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), (4,4). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

Maybe I should adjust my path to include that apple.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (4,6).\n\n- Move right to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Then, maybe move up to (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9), but there are no apples there, as far as I can see.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move right to (5,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nOption 3:\n\n- Move right to (5,4).\n\n- Move up to (5,5), (5,6), etc.\n\nBut, considering that I need to be cautious of the enemy, and also of my own growing length, perhaps sticking to vertical movement for now is safer.\n\nAlso, moving right from (4,4) to (5,4) might not be the best idea because there's no immediate apple there, and I might be moving away from the apples at (4,5) and (6,6).\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is two rows down and two columns to the right from my current position.\n\nSo, perhaps a better plan is to move up to (4,5), eat the apple, then move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, I can consider moving to (5,7), (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or my own tail in the process.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down from (4,4) to (4,3), but that's where my tail is, and if I move down further, I might get boxed in.\n\nWait, no, my tail is at (4,3), and since I've grown by eating the apple at (4,4), my tail might have moved, but according to the board, it's still at (4,3).\n\nActually, when you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, and your snake grows by adding a new segment in the direction you're moving.\n\nWait, no, in classic Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays, and you don't lose segments unless you move into a wall or yourself.\n\nBut in this game, since there are multiple apples, and you can grow multiple times, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, after eating the apple at (4,4), my snake has grown, so I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving up to (4,5) seems safe.\n\nThen, from (4,5), moving up to (4,6), which is empty, then right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), where there's an apple at (6,6).\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (6,6), which is two rows down from (4,4).\n\nActually, looking back, the apple positions are:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nSo, from (4,4), up to (4,5), eat the apple, then up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is at row 6, column 6.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), but the apple is at (6,6), which is down from there.\n\nWait, no, if I'm at (5,5), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6) to get the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a better plan is to stay in the central area, eat the apples at (4,5) and (6,6), and then head towards (5,8).\n\nBut, moving from (4,5) to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (6,6) seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving down from (4,5) to (4,4), but that's where I just came from, and I don't want to go back because I might hit my own body.\n\nWait, no, since I've grown, my body is now at (4,3), and possibly (4,2), depending on how much I've grown.\n\nActually, every time I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my tail stays, and I don't lose segments.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is.\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- Me at (4,4)\n\n- Tail at (4,3)\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (4,3), and a new segment will be added where I was before eating, which is (4,4).\n\nSo, after eating (4,5), my snake will be at (4,5), (4,4), and (4,3).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,6), I'm safe.\n\nThen, I can move right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, the apple is"

So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (5,4). Wait, in the last move information, it says I was at (5,4), but looking at the board state, it seems like I might have moved since then. Let me confirm.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots except possibly apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: me at (5,4).\n\nRow 3: tail at (4,3).\n\nRow 2: dot.\n\nRow 1: enemy at (7,1).\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (5,4), and I need to decide where to go next.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,1) with no body parts.\n\nGiven this, I need to prioritize which apple to go for and make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (4,5), which is directly above me.

So, to get to (4,5), I need to move up to (5,5), then left to (4,5).\n\nWait, no. If I'm at (5,4), moving up would be to (5,5), then left to (4,5).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving up to (5,5) is safe. Let's see what's at (5,5). According to the board, it's a dot, so it's empty.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (5,4).\n\nThen, from (4,5), I can consider moving up to (4,6), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, I can move right to (5,5), but again, no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right. Maybe I should aim for that after getting the one at (4,5).\n\nBut, I should also consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move towards (6,6), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner, which is where the enemy is headed, based on its current position.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nTo get there, I would need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving right to (6,4), then down to (6,5), and then (6,6).\n\nThat seems like a shorter path to an apple.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy, which is at (7,1).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n\nSo, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0). Wait, but earlier it was said apples are at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), (4,4). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

If I move towards (6,6), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner, which is where the enemy is headed, based on its current position.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nTo get there, I would need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving right to (6,4), then down to (6,5), and then (6,6).\n\nThat seems like a shorter path to an apple.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy, which is at (7,1).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

That seems like the closest one, and moving left to (4,5) would allow me to eat it.\n\nBut, I need to think about what's after that.

So, maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nBut, I need to be careful because the enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . .

Then, after eating that apple, I can consider my options again.\n\nBut I should also think a few steps ahead. After eating (4,5), what's next?\n\nIf I move up from (4,5) to (4,6), there's no apple there. So, maybe I should consider moving right to (5,5), but there's no apple there either. Alternatively, I could move to (4,6) and then to (5,6), where there's an apple at (5,8), but that's further up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.

According to the board, it's a dot, so it's empty.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (5,4).\n\nThen, from (4,5), I can consider moving up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.

Maybe I should aim for that after getting the one at (4,5).\n\nBut, I should also consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move towards (6,6), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner, which is where the enemy is headed, based on its current position.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nTo get there, I would need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving right to (6,4), then down to (6,5), and then (6,6).\n\nThat seems like a shorter path to an apple.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy, which is at (7,1).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

There might be some confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, in the last move information, it says I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), and the rationale was to go for the apple at (5,8). So, now I'm at (5,5), and I need to decide my next move.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,1) with no body parts.\n\nGiven this, I need to prioritize which apple to go for and make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (4,5), which is directly left of me. That seems like the closest one, and moving left to (4,5) would allow me to eat it.\n\nBut, I need to think about what's after that. After eating the apple at (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (5,5).\n\nThen, from (4,5), I can consider moving up to (4,6), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, I can move left again to (3,5), but again, no apple.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5). So, maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nBut, I need to be careful because the enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move down, I might get closer to the enemy.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nThis seems like a longer path, but it might be safer since the enemy is below me.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nThis would require moving down and to the right, passing through (5,5) to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), then right to (6,1), (7,1), etc., down to (9,1).\n\nThis is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,5), I can move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,5), and my tail is at (5,4), as per the last move.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,5), I need to move up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,6).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,7), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), with the intention to go for (5,8).\n\nSo, continuing that path, I should move up to (5,6) this turn.\n\nBut let's confirm the board state again.\n\nRow 9: dots, with apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: dots.\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: dot.\n\nRow 3: dot.\n\nRow 2: dot, enemy at (7,2).\n\nRow 1: dot.\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nWait, there seems to be some inconsistency in the board state description.\n\nBut assuming that, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6) is safe and leads me towards the apple at (5,8), that seems like a good move.\n\nI should proceed with moving up to (5,6).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n\nSo, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0). Wait, but earlier it was said apples are at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), (4,4). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

Wait, in the last move information, it says I was at (4,2), but according to the board state, I'm at (4,3). Maybe I moved up since the last turn. Okay, so I'm at (4,3).\n\nThere are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (8,1) with its body at [], which probably means it's just the head with no body parts yet.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: all dots except possibly the apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: apple at (4,4).\n\nRow 3: me at (4,3).\n\nRow 2: dot.\n\nRow 1: enemy at (8,1) and apple at (9,1).\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nSo, my position is (4,3), and I need to decide where to go next.\n\nMy last move was up, from (4,2) to (4,3), aiming to get to the apples directly above me at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nThat seems like a good plan because those apples are right in line with my current position, and there don't seem to be any immediate obstacles.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy snake. It's at (8,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it starts moving upwards, it might eventually cross my path, but for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, after eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving to other apples. The apple at (5,8) seems fairly distant, and there are apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0), but the enemy is already near there.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the central area for now, secure those apples, and then decide what to do next.\n\nSo, continuing from (4,3), moving up to (4,4), eating the apple, then to (4,5), eating that one too.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving right to column 5 and going up to (5,8).\n\nAlternatively, I could look towards the apples in the bottom right, but that might put me in direct competition with the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, sticking to the central area seems safer for now.\n\nI should also be aware of my own body as I grow longer. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in or make sharp turns that could cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSo, for this turn, since I'm at (4,3), and the apple is at (4,4) directly above me, I should move up to (4,4).\n\nThen, in the next turn, I can eat the apple at (4,5).\n\nAfter that, I'll need to decide whether to move right to column 5 and go up to (5,8), or maybe head towards the bottom right corner.\n\nBut for now, moving up seems like the safest and most straightforward choice.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's position and movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nBut for this turn, I think moving up to (4,4) is the way to go.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

So, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail as I continue moving.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it starts moving upwards, it might eventually cross my path, but for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nI should consider my next move from (4,4). The apple above me at (4,5) is my immediate target. If I move up to (4,5), I'll eat that apple and grow longer again.\n\nAfter that, I could consider moving right to column 5 and going up to (5,8), or maybe towards the apple at (6,6).\n\nAlternatively, there are apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0), but the enemy is already near there at (7,1). I should be cautious about going there because the enemy might be trying to get those apples too.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer for me to stay in the central area for now, secure the apples around me, and then decide what to do next.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving up to (4,5) seems straightforward. Then, after eating that apple, I can consider my options again.\n\nBut I should also think a few steps ahead. After eating (4,5), what's next?\n\nIf I move up from (4,5) to (4,6), there's no apple there. So, maybe I should consider moving right to (5,5), but there's no apple there either. Alternatively, I could move to (4,6) and then to (5,6), where there's an apple at (5,8), but that's further up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right. Maybe I should adjust my path to include that apple.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (4,6).\n\n- Move right to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Then, maybe move up to (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9), but there are no apples there, as far as I can see.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move right to (5,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nOption 3:\n\n- Move right to (5,4).\n\n- Move up to (5,5), (5,6), etc.\n\nBut, considering that I need to be cautious of the enemy, and also of my own growing length, perhaps sticking to vertical movement for now is safer.\n\nAlso, moving right from (4,4) to (5,4) might not be the best idea because there's no immediate apple there, and I might be moving away from the apples at (4,5) and (6,6).\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is two rows down and two columns to the right from my current position.\n\nSo, perhaps a better plan is to move up to (4,5), eat the apple, then move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, I can consider moving to (5,7), (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or my own tail in the process.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down from (4,4) to (4,3), but that's where my tail is, and if I move down further, I might get boxed in.\n\nWait, no, my tail is at (4,3), and since I've grown by eating the apple at (4,4), my tail might have moved, but according to the board, it's still at (4,3).\n\nActually, when you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, and your snake grows by adding a new segment in the direction you're moving.\n\nWait, no, in classic Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays, and you don't lose segments unless you move into a wall or yourself.\n\nBut in this game, since there are multiple apples, and you can grow multiple times, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, after eating the apple at (4,4), my snake has grown, so I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving up to (4,5) seems safe.\n\nThen, from (4,5), moving up to (4,6), which is empty, then right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), where there's an apple at (6,6).\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (6,6), which is two rows down from (4,4).\n\nActually, looking back, the apple positions are:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nSo, from (4,4), up to (4,5), eat the apple, then up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is at row 6, column 6.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), but the apple is at (6,6), which is down from there.\n\nWait, no, if I'm at (5,5), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6) to get the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a better plan is to stay in the central area, eat the apples at (4,5) and (6,6), and then head towards (5,8).\n\nBut, moving from (4,5) to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (6,6) seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving down from (4,5) to (4,4), but that's where I just came from, and I don't want to go back because I might hit my own body.\n\nWait, no, since I've grown, my body is now at (4,3), and possibly (4,2), depending on how much I've grown.\n\nActually, every time I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my tail stays, and I don't lose segments.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is.\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- Me at (4,4)\n\n- Tail at (4,3)\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (4,3), and a new segment will be added where I was before eating, which is (4,4).\n\nSo, after eating (4,5), my snake will be at (4,5), (4,4), and (4,3).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,6), I'm safe.\n\nThen, I can move right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, the apple is"

If I'm at (5,4), moving up would be to (5,5), then left to (4,5).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving up to (5,5) is safe. Let's see what's at (5,5). According to the board, it's a dot, so it's empty.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (5,4).\n\nThen, from (4,5), I can consider moving up to (4,6), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, I can move right to (5,5), but again, no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right. Maybe I should aim for that after getting the one at (4,5).\n\nBut, I should also consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move towards (6,6), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner, which is where the enemy is headed, based on its current position.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nTo get there, I would need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving right to (6,4), then down to (6,5), and then (6,6).\n\nThat seems like a shorter path to an apple.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy, which is at (7,1).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,5), and my tail is at (5,4), as per the last move.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,5), I need to move up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,6).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,7), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), with the intention to go for (5,8).\n\nSo, continuing that path, I should move up to (5,6) this turn.\n\nBut let's confirm the board state again.\n\nRow 9: dots, with apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: dots.\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: dot.\n\nRow 3: dot.\n\nRow 2: dot, enemy at (7,2).\n\nRow 1: dot.\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nWait, there seems to be some inconsistency in the board state description.\n\nBut assuming that, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6) is safe and leads me towards the apple at (5,8), that seems like a good move.\n\nI should proceed with moving up to (5,6).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . .

Then, after eating that apple, I can consider my options again.\n\nBut I should also think a few steps ahead. After eating (4,5), what's next?\n\nIf I move up from (4,5) to (4,6), there's no apple there. So, maybe I should consider moving right to (5,5), but there's no apple there either. Alternatively, I could move to (4,6) and then to (5,6), where there's an apple at (5,8), but that's further up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.

According to the board, it's a dot, so it's empty.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (5,4).\n\nThen, from (4,5), I can consider moving up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.

Maybe I should aim for that after getting the one at (4,5).\n\nBut, I should also consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move towards (6,6), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner, which is where the enemy is headed, based on its current position.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nTo get there, I would need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving right to (6,4), then down to (6,5), and then (6,6).\n\nThat seems like a shorter path to an apple.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy, which is at (7,1).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

There might be some confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, in the last move information, it says I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), and the rationale was to go for the apple at (5,8). So, now I'm at (5,5), and I need to decide my next move.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,1) with no body parts.\n\nGiven this, I need to prioritize which apple to go for and make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (4,5), which is directly left of me. That seems like the closest one, and moving left to (4,5) would allow me to eat it.\n\nBut, I need to think about what's after that. After eating the apple at (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (5,5).\n\nThen, from (4,5), I can consider moving up to (4,6), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, I can move left again to (3,5), but again, no apple.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5). So, maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nBut, I need to be careful because the enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move down, I might get closer to the enemy.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nThis seems like a longer path, but it might be safer since the enemy is below me.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nThis would require moving down and to the right, passing through (5,5) to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), then right to (6,1), (7,1), etc., down to (9,1).\n\nThis is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,5), I can move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,5), and my tail is at (5,4), as per the last move.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,5), I need to move up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,6).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,7), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), with the intention to go for (5,8).\n\nSo, continuing that path, I should move up to (5,6) this turn.\n\nBut let's confirm the board state again.\n\nRow 9: dots, with apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: dots.\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: dot.\n\nRow 3: dot.\n\nRow 2: dot, enemy at (7,2).\n\nRow 1: dot.\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nWait, there seems to be some inconsistency in the board state description.\n\nBut assuming that, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6) is safe and leads me towards the apple at (5,8), that seems like a good move.\n\nI should proceed with moving up to (5,6).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n\nSo, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0). Wait, but earlier it was said apples are at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), (4,4). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

Then, after eating that apple, I can consider my options again.\n\nBut I should also think a few steps ahead. After eating (4,5), what's next?\n\nIf I move up from (4,5) to (4,6), there's no apple there. So, maybe I should consider moving right to (5,5), but there's no apple there either. Alternatively, I could move to (4,6) and then to (5,6), where there's an apple at (5,8), but that's further up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right. Maybe I should adjust my path to include that apple.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (4,6).\n\n- Move right to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Then, maybe move up to (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9), but there are no apples there, as far as I can see.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Move up to (4,5).\n\n- Move right to (5,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nOption 3:\n\n- Move right to (5,4).\n\n- Move up to (5,5), (5,6), etc.\n\nBut, considering that I need to be cautious of the enemy, and also of my own growing length, perhaps sticking to vertical movement for now is safer.\n\nAlso, moving right from (4,4) to (5,4) might not be the best idea because there's no immediate apple there, and I might be moving away from the apples at (4,5) and (6,6).\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is two rows down and two columns to the right from my current position.\n\nSo, perhaps a better plan is to move up to (4,5), eat the apple, then move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6) to get the apple at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, I can consider moving to (5,7), (5,8) to get the apple at (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or my own tail in the process.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down from (4,4) to (4,3), but that's where my tail is, and if I move down further, I might get boxed in.\n\nWait, no, my tail is at (4,3), and since I've grown by eating the apple at (4,4), my tail might have moved, but according to the board, it's still at (4,3).\n\nActually, when you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, and your snake grows by adding a new segment in the direction you're moving.\n\nWait, no, in classic Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays, and you don't lose segments unless you move into a wall or yourself.\n\nBut in this game, since there are multiple apples, and you can grow multiple times, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nGiven that, after eating the apple at (4,4), my snake has grown, so I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nSo, from (4,4), moving up to (4,5) seems safe.\n\nThen, from (4,5), moving up to (4,6), which is empty, then right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), where there's an apple at (6,6).\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (6,6), which is two rows down from (4,4).\n\nActually, looking back, the apple positions are:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nSo, from (4,4), up to (4,5), eat the apple, then up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (6,6), which is at row 6, column 6.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move right to (5,5), then up to (5,6), but the apple is at (6,6), which is down from there.\n\nWait, no, if I'm at (5,5), moving down to (5,6), then right to (6,6) to get the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into myself or the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a better plan is to stay in the central area, eat the apples at (4,5) and (6,6), and then head towards (5,8).\n\nBut, moving from (4,5) to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (6,6) seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving down from (4,5) to (4,4), but that's where I just came from, and I don't want to go back because I might hit my own body.\n\nWait, no, since I've grown, my body is now at (4,3), and possibly (4,2), depending on how much I've grown.\n\nActually, every time I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my tail stays, and I don't lose segments.\n\nSo, I need to keep track of where my body is.\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- Me at (4,4)\n\n- Tail at (4,3)\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (4,3), and a new segment will be added where I was before eating, which is (4,4).\n\nSo, after eating (4,5), my snake will be at (4,5), (4,4), and (4,3).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,6), I'm safe.\n\nThen, I can move right to (5,6), but there's no apple there.\n\nWait, the apple is"

If I move towards (6,6), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner, which is where the enemy is headed, based on its current position.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nTo get there, I would need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving right to (6,4), then down to (6,5), and then (6,6).\n\nThat seems like a shorter path to an apple.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy, which is at (7,1).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

There might be some confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, in the last move information, it says I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), and the rationale was to go for the apple at (5,8). So, now I'm at (5,5), and I need to decide my next move.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,1) with no body parts.\n\nGiven this, I need to prioritize which apple to go for and make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (4,5), which is directly left of me. That seems like the closest one, and moving left to (4,5) would allow me to eat it.\n\nBut, I need to think about what's after that.

So, maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nBut, I need to be careful because the enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move down, I might get closer to the enemy.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nThis seems like a longer path, but it might be safer since the enemy is below me.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nThis would require moving down and to the right, passing through (5,5) to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), then right to (6,1), (7,1), etc., down to (9,1).\n\nThis is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,5), I can move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me.

If I move up, I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good for safety.\n\nAnother option is to consider the apple at (6,6), which is to the right and slightly down.\n\nFrom (5,7), I could move right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut moving down might bring me closer to the enemy, which is at (7,3).\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,5) is to the left and down, which again might bring me closer to the enemy if it moves.\n\nThe apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are at the top-right corner, which is quite a distance away, and moving there would require navigating around potential hazards.\n\nGiven these options, I think the safest and most immediate choice is to continue moving up to (5,8) to eat the apple there.\n\nThis path minimizes the risk of encountering the enemy and allows me to gain a point quickly.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I can then decide whether to move right or left based on the board state at that time.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move up to (5,8).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\n\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\n\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\n\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\n\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)?

There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

Maybe I should aim for that after getting the one at (4,5).\n\nBut, I should also consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move towards (6,6), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner, which is where the enemy is headed, based on its current position.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nTo get there, I would need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving right to (6,4), then down to (6,5), and then (6,6).\n\nThat seems like a shorter path to an apple.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy, which is at (7,1).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

Let me confirm.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots except possibly apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: me at (5,4).\n\nRow 3: tail at (4,3).\n\nRow 2: dot.\n\nRow 1: enemy at (7,1).\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (5,4), and I need to decide where to go next.\n\nWait, but in the board state, it shows me at (5,4), but in the last move information, it says I was at (5,5). There might be some confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, in the last move information, it says I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), and the rationale was to go for the apple at (5,8). So, now I'm at (5,5), and I need to decide my next move.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,1) with no body parts.\n\nGiven this, I need to prioritize which apple to go for and make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (4,5), which is directly left of me. That seems like the closest one, and moving left to (4,5) would allow me to eat it.\n\nBut, I need to think about what's after that. After eating the apple at (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (5,5).\n\nThen, from (4,5), I can consider moving up to (4,6), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, I can move left again to (3,5), but again, no apple.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5). So, maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nBut, I need to be careful because the enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move down, I might get closer to the enemy.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nThis seems like a longer path, but it might be safer since the enemy is below me.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nThis would require moving down and to the right, passing through (5,5) to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), then right to (6,1), (7,1), etc., down to (9,1).\n\nThis is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,5), I can move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,5), and my tail is at (5,4), as per the last move.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,5), I need to move up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,6).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,7), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), with the intention to go for (5,8).\n\nSo, continuing that path, I should move up to (5,6) this turn.\n\nBut let's confirm the board state again.\n\nRow 9: dots, with apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: dots.\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: dot.\n\nRow 3: dot.\n\nRow 2: dot, enemy at (7,2).\n\nRow 1: dot.\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nWait, there seems to be some inconsistency in the board state description.\n\nBut assuming that, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6) is safe and leads me towards the apple at (5,8), that seems like a good move.\n\nI should proceed with moving up to (5,6).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and according to the last move information, I was at (5,7). But looking at the board state, it seems like I might have moved since then. Wait, in the board state, you're at (5,7), and the last move was UP from (5,6) to (5,7). So, I need to consider my current position as (5,7).\n\nThe board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots except possibly apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: you're at (5,7).\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: dots.\n\nRow 3: enemy at (7,3).\n\nRow 2: dots.\n\nRow 1: dots.\n\nRow 0: apples at (9,0) and (9,1).\n\nSo, I'm at (5,7), and I need to decide where to go next.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,3), which is below and to the right of me, with no body parts.\n\nGiven this, I need to prioritize which apple to go for and make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple directly above me at (5,8). It's right there, one step up from my current position.\n\nIf I move up to (5,8), I eat the apple, grow longer, and my tail will stay at (5,7).\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving right or left.\n\nMoving right would take me to (6,8), then down to (6,7), and possibly towards the apple at (6,6).\n\nAlternatively, moving left would take me to (4,8), then down to (4,7), and possibly towards the apple at (4,5).\n\nBoth paths seem feasible, but I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,3), which is below and to the right of me. If I move up, I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good for safety.\n\nAnother option is to consider the apple at (6,6), which is to the right and slightly down.\n\nFrom (5,7), I could move right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut moving down might bring me closer to the enemy, which is at (7,3).\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,5) is to the left and down, which again might bring me closer to the enemy if it moves.\n\nThe apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are at the top-right corner, which is quite a distance away, and moving there would require navigating around potential hazards.\n\nGiven these options, I think the safest and most immediate choice is to continue moving up to (5,8) to eat the apple there.\n\nThis path minimizes the risk of encountering the enemy and

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (4,2). There are apples at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), and (4,4). There's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,0) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (4,2), which is in the lower middle of the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is near the bottom right corner. There are apples scattered around: one near the top right, one in the middle left, and two near my position.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apples at (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me, which seems convenient. But I also need to consider the enemy snake and make sure I don't run into it or get boxed in.\n\nLet me plot this out mentally:\n\n- Apples:\n\n- (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner.\n\n- (5,8) is near the top middle.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) are directly above me.\n\n- Enemy snake at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for the apples directly above me first, since they're closer and don't require me to navigate around the enemy.\n\nBut I should also consider the growth. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which could help me protect myself from the enemy snake by blocking paths.\n\nLet me think about the path to the apples above me:\n\nFrom (4,2), moving up to (4,3), then (4,4), and (4,5). That seems straightforward, as there don't seem to be any obstacles in that column.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the enemy snake could interfere. The enemy is at (8,0), and if it starts moving upwards and to the left, it might cross my path eventually. But for now, it's fairly distant.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating one apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my tail doesn't get in the way if I need to make sharp turns later on.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) first, since it's closer, and then proceed to (4,5).\n\nLet me visualize this:\n\nStarting at (4,2):\n\n- Move up to (4,3)\n\n- Move up to (4,4) and eat the apple, growing longer.\n\n- Then move up to (4,5) and eat that apple as well.\n\nAfter eating two apples, I would have grown by two units, so my tail will be longer.\n\nBut I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's potential movements. If it starts moving upwards towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (5,8), which is higher up and to the right. That might give me a better position to control more of the board and potentially block the enemy.\n\nHowever, that apple is quite a distance away, and I'd have to navigate around possibly growing in length, which could make maneuvering more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to first eat the nearby apples to grow in size, making me a more formidable presence on the board, and then aim for the more distant apples.\n\nAlso, considering that there are apples at (9,1) and (9,0), which are in the bottom right corner, and the enemy is already near there at (8,0). If I go for those apples, I might end up competing directly with the enemy snake.\n\nMaybe it's better to avoid that area for now and focus on the center of the board.\n\nSo, back to the apples at (4,4) and (4,5). Let's see what's around those positions.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots, except possibly the apple at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: all dots.\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8), but that might be a typo since apples are at (5,8) and (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nWait, the board state seems to show:\n\nRow 9: all dots.\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 5: apple at (5,8)? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the board state is not fully provided.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . . . . . . A\n\n0 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n\nSo, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0). Wait, but earlier it was said apples are at (9,1), (9,0), (5,8), (4,5), (4,4). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the board state, apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\nSo, (5,8) might have been a mistake earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my plan.\n\nNow, apples are at (5,5), (4,4), (4,5), (9,1), and (9,0).\n\nI'm at (4,2), and the enemy is at (8,0).\n\nSo, the apples at (4,4) and (4,5) are directly above me, which is still a good target.\n\nLet me plan to move up to (4,3), then (4,4), eat the apple, grow, then to (4,5), eat that apple, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't box myself in or create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nAlso, I need to stay aware of the enemy's position and movements. If the enemy starts moving towards me, I might need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I can position myself in a way that my body blocks the enemy's path to certain areas, that could be beneficial.\n\nBut for now, since the enemy is at (8,0), which is below and to the right of me, and the apples I'm targeting are above me, I think it's safe to proceed upwards.\n\nAfter eating the apples at (4,4) and (4,5), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nPerhaps moving right to column 5, where there's an apple at (5,5), then maybe up to (5,8) if possible.\n\nBut first things first: get to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move up to (4,3).\n\nNo immediate threats, and I'm on my way to the nearest apples.\n\nI'll plan to continue moving up in the next turns until I reach the apples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nUP"

Maybe I should aim for that after getting the one at (4,5).\n\nBut, I should also consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move towards (6,6), I might get too close to the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are in the bottom right corner, which is where the enemy is headed, based on its current position.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nTo get there, I would need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might expose myself to the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving right to (6,4), then down to (6,5), and then (6,6).\n\nThat seems like a shorter path to an apple.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy, which is at (7,1).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,5).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then left to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, perhaps move up to (4,6), but there's no apple there.\n\n- Alternatively, move right to (5,5), but that's where I just came from.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6).\n\n- Move right to (6,4).\n\n- Then up to (6,5).\n\n- Then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\n- After that, I can consider moving up to (6,7), but there are no apples there.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8).\n\n- Move up to (5,5).\n\n- Then up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\n- This is a longer path, but it might be safer.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\n- Move right to (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then right to (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n\n- This is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and then up to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), and (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,4), and my tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,4), I need to move up to (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,5).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,6), and so on,"

Let me confirm.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots except possibly apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: all dots.\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: me at (5,4).\n\nRow 3: tail at (4,3).\n\nRow 2: dot.\n\nRow 1: enemy at (7,1).\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nSo, I'm at (5,4), and I need to decide where to go next.\n\nWait, but in the board state, it shows me at (5,4), but in the last move information, it says I was at (5,5). There might be some confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, in the last move information, it says I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), and the rationale was to go for the apple at (5,8). So, now I'm at (5,5), and I need to decide my next move.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,1) with no body parts.\n\nGiven this, I need to prioritize which apple to go for and make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (4,5), which is directly left of me. That seems like the closest one, and moving left to (4,5) would allow me to eat it.\n\nBut, I need to think about what's after that. After eating the apple at (4,5), I'll grow, so my tail will stay at (5,5).\n\nThen, from (4,5), I can consider moving up to (4,6), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, I can move left again to (3,5), but again, no apple.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, as there are no apples nearby after (4,5). So, maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (6,6), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nBut, I need to be careful because the enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If I move down, I might get closer to the enemy.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple at (5,8), which is straight up from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and finally (5,8).\n\nThis seems like a longer path, but it might be safer since the enemy is below me.\n\nOption 4: Go for the apples in the bottom right corner at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nThis would require moving down and to the right, passing through (5,5) to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), then right to (6,1), (7,1), etc., down to (9,1).\n\nThis is a long path and risky, as the enemy is already near there.\n\nConsidering these options, perhaps the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,6), as it's relatively close and has a direct path.\n\nSo, from (5,5), I can move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same area.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below and to the right of me. If it moves up, it might head towards (7,2), (7,3), etc.\n\nSo, if I move right to (6,5), then down to (6,6), the enemy would have to move up to (7,2), (7,3), etc., to intercept me, which seems unlikely for now.\n\nTherefore, moving towards (6,6) seems like a safe choice.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then (6,8), and finally (6,9) to see if there are any apples there, but according to the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving right to (7,6), but there are no apples there either.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,8) is in column 5, row 8.\n\nSo, after getting the apple at (6,6), I can consider moving up to (6,7), then left to (5,7), and up to (5,8) to get that apple.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim directly for (5,8) from my current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nThis is a straight path upwards, and there don't seem to be any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1), which is below me, so unless it moves up, it shouldn't interfere.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nLet me think about my body positions.\n\nI'm at (5,5), and my tail is at (5,4), as per the last move.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,8), I'll have grown, so my tail will be at (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), assuming I move straight up.\n\nSo, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving straight up to (5,8) seems safe, as long as I continue moving up without turning.\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (5,8), I'll need to decide where to go next.\n\nPerhaps then I can consider moving right or left to get other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting the apple at (5,8) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, considering the apple at (4,5) is closer, I could go for that first, but as I thought earlier, there aren't any apples nearby after that, so it might not be the best use of my moves.\n\nGiven that, I think I should aim for the apple at (5,8).\n\nSo, from (5,5), I need to move up to (5,6), then (5,7), and (5,8).\n\nBut, in this turn, I can only make one move.\n\nSo, I should move up to (5,6).\n\nThen, next turn, I can continue moving up to (5,7), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I was at (5,4), moved up to (5,5), with the intention to go for (5,8).\n\nSo, continuing that path, I should move up to (5,6) this turn.\n\nBut let's confirm the board state again.\n\nRow 9: dots, with apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: dots.\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: dot.\n\nRow 3: dot.\n\nRow 2: dot, enemy at (7,2).\n\nRow 1: dot.\n\nRow 0: apple at (9,0).\n\nWait, there seems to be some inconsistency in the board state description.\n\nBut assuming that, from (5,5), moving up to (5,6) is safe and leads me towards the apple at (5,8), that seems like a good move.\n\nI should proceed with moving up to (5,6).\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and according to the last move information, I was at (5,7). But looking at the board state, it seems like I might have moved since then. Wait, in the board state, you're at (5,7), and the last move was UP from (5,6) to (5,7). So, I need to consider my current position as (5,7).\n\nThe board state shows:\n\nRow 9: all dots except possibly apples at (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nRow 8: apple at (5,8).\n\nRow 7: you're at (5,7).\n\nRow 6: apple at (6,6).\n\nRow 5: apple at (4,5).\n\nRow 4: dots.\n\nRow 3: enemy at (7,3).\n\nRow 2: dots.\n\nRow 1: dots.\n\nRow 0: apples at (9,0) and (9,1).\n\nSo, I'm at (5,7), and I need to decide where to go next.\n\nThere are apples at:\n\n- (9,1)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,3), which is below and to the right of me, with no body parts.\n\nGiven this, I need to prioritize which apple to go for and make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple directly above me at (5,8). It's right there, one step up from my current position.\n\nIf I move up to (5,8), I eat the apple, grow longer, and my tail will stay at (5,7).\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving right or left.\n\nMoving right would take me to (6,8), then down to (6,7), and possibly towards the apple at (6,6).\n\nAlternatively, moving left would take me to (4,8), then down to (4,7), and possibly towards the apple at (4,5).\n\nBoth paths seem feasible, but I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,3), which is below and to the right of me. If I move up, I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good for safety.\n\nAnother option is to consider the apple at (6,6), which is to the right and slightly down.\n\nFrom (5,7), I could move right to (6,7), then down to (6,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut moving down might bring me closer to the enemy, which is at (7,3).\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (4,5) is to the left and down, which again might bring me closer to the enemy if it moves.\n\nThe apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are at the top-right corner, which is quite a distance away, and moving there would require navigating around potential hazards.\n\nGiven these options, I think the safest and most immediate choice is to continue moving up to (5,8) to eat the apple there.\n\nThis path minimizes the risk of encountering the enemy and
