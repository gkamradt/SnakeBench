Moving RIGHT may be an indirect route to gather points but it does ensure safety from the enemy snake and keeps paths open for future movements.\n\nA good strategy to implement next turn could be to position myself in a way that hinders enemy snake's direct path to an apple, applying pressure and possibly leading it towards potential traps.\n\nMy next planned move is RIGHT."
