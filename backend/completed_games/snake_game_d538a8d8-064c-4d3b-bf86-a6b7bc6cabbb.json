My new body positions are now [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1)].\n- The enemy snake (#1) is currently at (6, 7) with its body at [(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)], positioned significantly farther down the board towards the left side.\n- Nearby apples remain at (6, 2), (0, 6), but I have also moved further towards (9,5) since the apple here has been consumed.\n\n### Potential Moves Analysis:\n1. **UP (to (9, 4))**: This position is open, as there are no obstacles, but it does not contain an apple.\n2. **DOWN (to (9, 2))**: This position is also open, contains no obstacles, but also does not offer an apple.\n3. **LEFT (to (8, 3))**: This would put me back to my previous head position, which is invalid.\n4. **RIGHT (to (10, 3))**: This move is out of bounds and invalid.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **UP (to (9, 4))**: Safe and strategic as it keeps potential paths open without heading back.\n- **DOWN (to (9, 2))**: Also a safe move and allows exploration further down where I could strategize to reach other apples later.\n- **LEFT (to (8, 3))**: Invalid move since it would return to the previous head position.\n- **RIGHT (to (10, 3))**: Out of bounds move, which is invalid.\n\nChoosing between moving UP or DOWN, neither immediately offers an apple but both would keep the snake in a safe position. Given that I want to keep pressure and strategic mobility while also allowing for future apple exploration, both potential moves are about equal in risk but allow for forward movement. \n\n### Next Move Decision:\nSince moving UP gives me an additional chance to explore further up or potentially move towards further apples on my next turn while also avoiding confrontation with the enemy, I\u2019ll choose to move **UP** to (9, 4). \n\n### Strategy Next Turn:\nAfter this move, I will evaluate how to position myself effectively towards apples while remaining aware of the enemy snake's movements. The priority will be keeping a safe distance while aiming for fruit opportunities.\n\nDecided next move: **UP**."

Their body is on (5, 9), (6, 9), and (6, 8), so there's no immediate threat as long as I stay away from their area.\n\n### Next Move Strategy:\nGiven that moving UP does not further my goal of approaching the nearest apple, I will prioritize moving LEFT to (7, 6) to set up a connection toward (6, 2). While moving UP would keep me in open space, I want to progress toward the apple rather than away.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move to maintain progress toward the nearest apple while avoiding any potential threats is to move LEFT to (7, 6).\n\nNext Move: **LEFT**."

While moving UP would keep me in open space, I want to progress toward the apple rather than away.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move to maintain progress toward the nearest apple while avoiding any potential threats is to move LEFT to (7, 6).\n\nNext Move: **LEFT**."

I will need to be cautious of potential enemy movements, especially considering that, at this time, the enemy snake is further away but could change positions quickly.\n\n### Final Decision:\nI will execute the move **DOWN** to (9, 7). \n\nNext Move: **DOWN**."
