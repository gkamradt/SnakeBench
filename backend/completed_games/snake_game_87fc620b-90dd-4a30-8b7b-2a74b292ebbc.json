We just moved left to our current position. \n\nSince we are already at the x-coordinate of 5, we should consider moving up to collect the apple at (5, 1) or moving towards the apple at (8, 9) or (6, 3). However, moving up to (5, 1) seems like a more efficient move in the long run, but it would require us to move down first, which could put us in a vulnerable position. \n\nA possible strategy for the next few turns could be to move towards the apple at (8, 9), as it is the closest apple to our current position that doesn't require us to move down. We should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions.\n\nFor now, let's prioritize moving towards the apple at (8, 9). To do that, we need to move right. \n\nNext turn, I want to remind myself to keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and be prepared to change direction if necessary.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
