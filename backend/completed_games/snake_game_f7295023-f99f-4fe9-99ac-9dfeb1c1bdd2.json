            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (5,6), which is in row 6, column 5. There's an apple at (5,5), directly below me. Another apple at (8,9), which is up and to the right. There's an apple at (0,6), which is to my left, same row. One at (9,2), which is to the right and down. And one at (6,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): distance is |5-5| + |6-5| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- (0,6): distance is |5-0| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- (9,2): distance is |5-9| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (6,1): distance is |5-6| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (8,9): distance is |5-8| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only one step down.\n\nBut I should also consider if that's the best choice. If I take that apple, I grow longer, which could be good, but I need to make sure I don't get boxed in or hit by the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, if I move down to (5,5), I would be at the apple. Since I grow after eating, my tail will extend, but in this case, since I'm just the head right now, my body will have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (5,6).\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves. After eating the apple at (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (5,5) is directly down. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nWait, but (5,5) is directly down, and there's another apple at (5,5). Wait, no, I'm confused.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly down from me at (5,6). So, if I move down to (5,5), I eat that apple, grow, and then need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple. The apple at (0,6) is now five steps to the left, while the apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nBut, I also need to be aware of the enemy snake at (4,0). It's at the bottom row, column 4. It doesn't have any body parts, so it's probably just the head as well.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake. Since snakes can't occupy the same space, if I'm moving towards an apple, I need to ensure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same apple in a way that would cause a collision.\n\nLet me think about possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (5,5).\n\nMove down from (5,6) to (5,5).\n\nThen, look for the next apple. The apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right, about four steps up and three steps right.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. The closest apple for the enemy might be the one at (6,1), which is up and to the right from its position.\n\nWait, let's calculate the distance for the enemy to each apple:\n\n- (8,9): |4-8| + |0-9| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\n- (0,6): |4-0| + |0-6| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (9,2): |4-9| + |0-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (5,5): |4-5| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nSo, the closest for the enemy is (6,1), which is at distance 3.\n\nTherefore, it might be moving towards (6,1).\n\nIf I go for (5,5), then I need to consider what's next. After eating (5,5), I could potentially go for (0,6), but that's five steps to the left, which might take too much time, and the enemy could reach (6,1) before me.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut, moving to (8,9) would require me to go up three rows and right three columns.\n\nLet's see, from (5,6) to (8,9): up three, right three.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,6):\n\n- Up to (5,7)\n\n- Up to (5,8)\n\n- Up to (5,9)\n\n- Right to (6,9)\n\n- Right to (7,9)\n\n- Right to (8,9)\n\nBut, there's an apple at (8,9), so that's the target.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), directly down.\n\nI need to prioritize.\n\nOption 2: Go for (0,6), which is left five steps, same row.\n\nBut that seems too far, and the enemy might intercept other apples before I can get there.\n\nOption 3: Go for (9,2), which is right four steps and down four steps.\n\nThat seems even farther.\n\nOption 4: Go for (6,1), which is right one and down five.\n\nAgain, that's quite a distance.\n\nOption 5: Go for (8,9), which is up three and right three.\n\nHmm.\n\nConsidering that I can grow by eating apples, perhaps it's better to go for closer apples first to increase my length and make it harder for the enemy to hit me.\n\nBut, longer snakes are also harder to maneuver, so I need to balance growth and agility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for apples that are less accessible to the enemy, to minimize competition.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, not too close to enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from enemy horizontally, but same row.\n\n- (9,2): far to the right and down, enemy would have to move there.\n\n- (6,1): to the right and down, closer to enemy.\n\n- (8,9): up and to the right, far from enemy.\n\nSo, (5,5) and (8,9) seem like good options.\n\nBut (5,5) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I can decide based on the new board state.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (6,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . .

A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . 1 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,6), which is in row 6, column 6. There's an apple at (5,5), which is left and down from me. Another apple at (8,9), up and to the right. Apples at (0,6), same row but all the way to the left. At (9,2), right and down. And at (6,1), directly down from me.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (0,6): |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |6-9| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (8,9): |6-8| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. Let's calculate the distances for the enemy:\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (5,5): |5-5| + |0-5| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nSo, the enemy's closest apple is at (6,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple at (6,1) is directly down from me, and it's also the closest to the enemy.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for (5,5), which is closer for me, or maybe aim for another apple to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), it's only 2 moves away, and the enemy is 2 moves away from (6,1). So, I can probably grab (5,5) before the enemy gets to (6,1).\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I'll grow longer, which could be an advantage.\n\nBut, I need to plan my next moves after that. Let's say I go to (5,5). Then, which apple should I go for next?\n\nAt that point, the apples would be at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), and (6,1). The enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I need to consider that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5), then (0,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), and so on to (0,5). But wait, (0,6) is directly left, same row.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at row 6, column 0. From (5,5), I'd need to move up to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on to (0,6).\n\nThat would take |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves in total from my current position.\n\nBut, if I go for (5,5) first, it's 2 moves, then from there to (0,6), it's 5 moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going directly to (0,6) from (6,6) would be |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 moves.\n\nWait, but going to (5,5) first adds extra moves. Maybe going directly to (0,6) is better in terms of total moves.\n\nBut, (5,5) is closer, so perhaps I should take it first to grow and then aim for (0,6).\n\nHowever, the enemy is closer to (6,1), which is at distance 2 for them, same as my distance to (5,5).\n\nIf I take (5,5), and the enemy takes (6,1), then we both get an apple, and I've grown longer.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can go for (0,6), while the enemy goes for another apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for (8,9), which is farther away but less accessible to the enemy.\n\nFrom (6,6), to (8,9), it's up 3 and right 2, so 5 moves.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (5,0), and to get to (8,9), they'd need to go up 9 and right 3, which is 12 moves.\n\nSo, that might be a safer option, as the enemy would take longer to reach (8,9).\n\nHowever, it's farther for me as well.\n\nLet me consider the risks.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), which is close, and the enemy goes for (6,1), which is also close, we might collide somewhere in the middle if we're both moving towards our chosen apples.\n\nI need to be careful about that.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (8,9), the enemy might not be able to reach it before me, but it's a longer path.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apple that no one else is likely to reach soon.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, medium distance for the enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from both, horizontally for the enemy.\n\n- (9,2): far for both, but closer to the enemy vertically.\n\n- (6,1): close to the enemy, below me.\n\n- (8,9): far from both, but closer to me relatively.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should go for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and I can secure it without interference.\n\nBut, it's also far for me, and I need to make sure that I don't leave too much space for the enemy to maneuver in the meantime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (0,6), which is far from both, but since it's to the left, I need to make sure that I don't run into the wall.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at x=0, which is the leftmost column, so I need to be careful not to go past x=0.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that growing my snake might make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\n\nBut, in this case, since the board is 10x10, and I'm starting from (6,6), I have room to grow.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is right now. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, if I move to (5,6), then my tail will move"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . .

A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (5,6), which is in row 6, column 5. There's an apple at (5,5), directly below me. Another apple at (8,9), which is up and to the right. There's an apple at (0,6), which is to my left, same row. One at (9,2), which is to the right and down. And one at (6,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): distance is |5-5| + |6-5| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- (0,6): distance is |5-0| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- (9,2): distance is |5-9| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (6,1): distance is |5-6| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (8,9): distance is |5-8| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only one step down.\n\nBut I should also consider if that's the best choice. If I take that apple, I grow longer, which could be good, but I need to make sure I don't get boxed in or hit by the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, if I move down to (5,5), I would be at the apple. Since I grow after eating, my tail will extend, but in this case, since I'm just the head right now, my body will have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (5,6).\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves. After eating the apple at (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (5,5) is directly down. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nWait, but (5,5) is directly down, and there's another apple at (5,5). Wait, no, I'm confused.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly down from me at (5,6). So, if I move down to (5,5), I eat that apple, grow, and then need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple. The apple at (0,6) is now five steps to the left, while the apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nBut, I also need to be aware of the enemy snake at (4,0). It's at the bottom row, column 4. It doesn't have any body parts, so it's probably just the head as well.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake. Since snakes can't occupy the same space, if I'm moving towards an apple, I need to ensure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same apple in a way that would cause a collision.\n\nLet me think about possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (5,5).\n\nMove down from (5,6) to (5,5).\n\nThen, look for the next apple. The apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right, about four steps up and three steps right.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. The closest apple for the enemy might be the one at (6,1), which is up and to the right from its position.\n\nWait, let's calculate the distance for the enemy to each apple:\n\n- (8,9): |4-8| + |0-9| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\n- (0,6): |4-0| + |0-6| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (9,2): |4-9| + |0-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (5,5): |4-5| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nSo, the closest for the enemy is (6,1), which is at distance 3.\n\nTherefore, it might be moving towards (6,1).\n\nIf I go for (5,5), then I need to consider what's next. After eating (5,5), I could potentially go for (0,6), but that's five steps to the left, which might take too much time, and the enemy could reach (6,1) before me.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut, moving to (8,9) would require me to go up three rows and right three columns.\n\nLet's see, from (5,6) to (8,9): up three, right three.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,6):\n\n- Up to (5,7)\n\n- Up to (5,8)\n\n- Up to (5,9)\n\n- Right to (6,9)\n\n- Right to (7,9)\n\n- Right to (8,9)\n\nBut, there's an apple at (8,9), so that's the target.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), directly down.\n\nI need to prioritize.\n\nOption 2: Go for (0,6), which is left five steps, same row.\n\nBut that seems too far, and the enemy might intercept other apples before I can get there.\n\nOption 3: Go for (9,2), which is right four steps and down four steps.\n\nThat seems even farther.\n\nOption 4: Go for (6,1), which is right one and down five.\n\nAgain, that's quite a distance.\n\nOption 5: Go for (8,9), which is up three and right three.\n\nHmm.\n\nConsidering that I can grow by eating apples, perhaps it's better to go for closer apples first to increase my length and make it harder for the enemy to hit me.\n\nBut, longer snakes are also harder to maneuver, so I need to balance growth and agility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for apples that are less accessible to the enemy, to minimize competition.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, not too close to enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from enemy horizontally, but same row.\n\n- (9,2): far to the right and down, enemy would have to move there.\n\n- (6,1): to the right and down, closer to enemy.\n\n- (8,9): up and to the right, far from enemy.\n\nSo, (5,5) and (8,9) seem like good options.\n\nBut (5,5) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I can decide based on the new board state.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,"

The enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I need to consider that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5), then (0,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), and so on to (0,5). But wait, (0,6) is directly left, same row.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at row 6, column 0. From (5,5), I'd need to move up to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on to (0,6).\n\nThat would take |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves in total from my current position.\n\nBut, if I go for (5,5) first, it's 2 moves, then from there to (0,6), it's 5 moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going directly to (0,6) from (6,6) would be |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 moves.\n\nWait, but going to (5,5) first adds extra moves. Maybe going directly to (0,6) is better in terms of total moves.\n\nBut, (5,5) is closer, so perhaps I should take it first to grow and then aim for (0,6).\n\nHowever, the enemy is closer to (6,1), which is at distance 2 for them, same as my distance to (5,5).\n\nIf I take (5,5), and the enemy takes (6,1), then we both get an apple, and I've grown longer.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can go for (0,6), while the enemy goes for another apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for (8,9), which is farther away but less accessible to the enemy.\n\nFrom (6,6), to (8,9), it's up 3 and right 2, so 5 moves.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (5,0), and to get to (8,9), they'd need to go up 9 and right 3, which is 12 moves.\n\nSo, that might be a safer option, as the enemy would take longer to reach (8,9).\n\nHowever, it's farther for me as well.\n\nLet me consider the risks.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), which is close, and the enemy goes for (6,1), which is also close, we might collide somewhere in the middle if we're both moving towards our chosen apples.\n\nI need to be careful about that.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (8,9), the enemy might not be able to reach it before me, but it's a longer path.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apple that no one else is likely to reach soon.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, medium distance for the enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from both, horizontally for the enemy.\n\n- (9,2): far for both, but closer to the enemy vertically.\n\n- (6,1): close to the enemy, below me.\n\n- (8,9): far from both, but closer to me relatively.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should go for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and I can secure it without interference.\n\nBut, it's also far for me, and I need to make sure that I don't leave too much space for the enemy to maneuver in the meantime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (0,6), which is far from both, but since it's to the left, I need to make sure that I don't run into the wall.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at x=0, which is the leftmost column, so I need to be careful not to go past x=0.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that growing my snake might make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\n\nBut, in this case, since the board is 10x10, and I'm starting from (6,6), I have room to grow.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is right now. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, if I move to (5,6), then my tail will move"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,6). Wait, in the board state, it shows my position at (6,6), but according to the text, it's at (7,6). There might be a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . 1 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, row 6, column 6 has my snake's head, which is position (6,6). But earlier it was mentioned that my snake is at (7,6). Maybe there's a confusion between row and column indices. In programming, it's common to refer to positions as (row, column), which corresponds to (Y, X). So, position (6,6) would be row 6, column 6. But in the initial statement, it says the snake is at (7,6), which might be a mistake.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll stick with the board state provided, which places my snake at (6,6).\n\nNow, there are apples at:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,5)\n\nAnd the enemy snake, number 1, is at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so likely just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Enemy's proximity**: Which apple is closest to the enemy snake.\n\n3. **Path clearance**: Ensuring the path to the apple is safe and doesn't lead to collisions.\n\n4. **Board boundaries**: Avoiding walls and ensuring there's room to maneuver.\n\n5. **Future moves**: Planning ahead to the next apple after the current one.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (0,6): |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |6-9| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (8,9): |6-8| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5) with a distance of 2.\n\nNow, let's see how close the enemy is to each apple:\n\nEnemy is at (5,0).\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (5,5): |5-5| + |0-5| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe enemy's closest apple is (6,1), also with a distance of 2.\n\nHmm, so both me and the enemy have apples that are 2 moves away, but they're different apples.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for (5,5) or consider another apple to avoid direct competition with the enemy.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Closest apple.\n\n- Enemy is going for (6,1), which is separate.\n\n- Can quickly secure points.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- If the enemy decides to change path or if their path intersects with mine.\n\nOption 2: Go for (6,1).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Same distance as the enemy, but I might get there first if I move quickly.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- Direct competition with the enemy.\n\n- Riskier due to potential collisions.\n\nOption 3: Go for a farther apple, like (8,9) or (0,6).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Less competition with the enemy.\n\n- Can secure more points if managed properly.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- Longer travel time, during which the enemy could be gaining points.\n\nGiven that (5,5) is the closest and not contested, it seems best to go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the board will have fewer apples, and the enemy might have moved closer to another apple.\n\nLet me plan the path to (5,5):\n\nFrom (6,6) to (5,5):\n\n- Move left to (5,6)\n\n- Move down to (5,5)\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nI need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead to collisions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, moving left to (5,6) is safe; it's currently empty.\n\nThen moving down to (5,5), which has an apple.\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't cause my tail to block my path.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (5,5).\n\nOnce at (5,5), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\nThe enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I should consider that.\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (5,5) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple from (5,5) would be (6,1), but if the enemy has already taken it, I need to choose another one.\n\nAssuming the enemy takes (6,1), then my next best option would be (0,6) at a distance of 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,9) or (9,2), both at distance 7.\n\nBut (0,6) is closer, so perhaps that's a better choice.\n\nWait, but (0,6) is at the left edge, and I need to make sure I don't run into the wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy might be moving towards (9,2) after taking (6,1).\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, maybe after taking (5,5), I should consider going for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and by the time the enemy reaches there, I might already have it.\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might be exposing myself to risks.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to take the closest apple without worrying too much about the enemy, and then assess the situation.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with going to (5,5).\n\nNow, to get there, my first move should be to the left, to (5,6).\n\nThen, move down to (5,5).\n\nBut, in the last move, I moved right, according to the information provided.\n\nWait, the last move information says:\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, but according to the board state, my head is at (6,6), and I need to move left to (5,6).\n\nBut in the last move, I moved right, which would have taken me to (7,6), but according to the board, I'm at (6,6).\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the board representation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- Rows are Y coordinates, with 0 at"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (5,6), which is in row 6, column 5. There's an apple at (5,5), directly below me. Another apple at (8,9), which is up and to the right. There's an apple at (0,6), which is to my left, same row. One at (9,2), which is to the right and down. And one at (6,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): distance is |5-5| + |6-5| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- (0,6): distance is |5-0| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- (9,2): distance is |5-9| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (6,1): distance is |5-6| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (8,9): distance is |5-8| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only one step down.\n\nBut I should also consider if that's the best choice. If I take that apple, I grow longer, which could be good, but I need to make sure I don't get boxed in or hit by the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, if I move down to (5,5), I would be at the apple. Since I grow after eating, my tail will extend, but in this case, since I'm just the head right now, my body will have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (5,6).\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves. After eating the apple at (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (5,5) is directly down. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nWait, but (5,5) is directly down, and there's another apple at (5,5). Wait, no, I'm confused.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly down from me at (5,6). So, if I move down to (5,5), I eat that apple, grow, and then need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple. The apple at (0,6) is now five steps to the left, while the apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nBut, I also need to be aware of the enemy snake at (4,0). It's at the bottom row, column 4. It doesn't have any body parts, so it's probably just the head as well.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake. Since snakes can't occupy the same space, if I'm moving towards an apple, I need to ensure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same apple in a way that would cause a collision.\n\nLet me think about possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (5,5).\n\nMove down from (5,6) to (5,5).\n\nThen, look for the next apple. The apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right, about four steps up and three steps right.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. The closest apple for the enemy might be the one at (6,1), which is up and to the right from its position.\n\nWait, let's calculate the distance for the enemy to each apple:\n\n- (8,9): |4-8| + |0-9| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\n- (0,6): |4-0| + |0-6| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (9,2): |4-9| + |0-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (5,5): |4-5| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nSo, the closest for the enemy is (6,1), which is at distance 3.\n\nTherefore, it might be moving towards (6,1).\n\nIf I go for (5,5), then I need to consider what's next. After eating (5,5), I could potentially go for (0,6), but that's five steps to the left, which might take too much time, and the enemy could reach (6,1) before me.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut, moving to (8,9) would require me to go up three rows and right three columns.\n\nLet's see, from (5,6) to (8,9): up three, right three.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,6):\n\n- Up to (5,7)\n\n- Up to (5,8)\n\n- Up to (5,9)\n\n- Right to (6,9)\n\n- Right to (7,9)\n\n- Right to (8,9)\n\nBut, there's an apple at (8,9), so that's the target.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), directly down.\n\nI need to prioritize.\n\nOption 2: Go for (0,6), which is left five steps, same row.\n\nBut that seems too far, and the enemy might intercept other apples before I can get there.\n\nOption 3: Go for (9,2), which is right four steps and down four steps.\n\nThat seems even farther.\n\nOption 4: Go for (6,1), which is right one and down five.\n\nAgain, that's quite a distance.\n\nOption 5: Go for (8,9), which is up three and right three.\n\nHmm.\n\nConsidering that I can grow by eating apples, perhaps it's better to go for closer apples first to increase my length and make it harder for the enemy to hit me.\n\nBut, longer snakes are also harder to maneuver, so I need to balance growth and agility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for apples that are less accessible to the enemy, to minimize competition.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, not too close to enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from enemy horizontally, but same row.\n\n- (9,2): far to the right and down, enemy would have to move there.\n\n- (6,1): to the right and down, closer to enemy.\n\n- (8,9): up and to the right, far from enemy.\n\nSo, (5,5) and (8,9) seem like good options.\n\nBut (5,5) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I can decide based on the new board state.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (6,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . .

A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . 1 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,6), which is in row 6, column 6. There's an apple at (5,5), which is left and down from me. Another apple at (8,9), up and to the right. Apples at (0,6), same row but all the way to the left. At (9,2), right and down. And at (6,1), directly down from me.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (0,6): |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |6-9| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (8,9): |6-8| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. Let's calculate the distances for the enemy:\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (5,5): |5-5| + |0-5| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nSo, the enemy's closest apple is at (6,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple at (6,1) is directly down from me, and it's also the closest to the enemy.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for (5,5), which is closer for me, or maybe aim for another apple to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), it's only 2 moves away, and the enemy is 2 moves away from (6,1). So, I can probably grab (5,5) before the enemy gets to (6,1).\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I'll grow longer, which could be an advantage.\n\nBut, I need to plan my next moves after that. Let's say I go to (5,5). Then, which apple should I go for next?\n\nAt that point, the apples would be at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), and (6,1). The enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I need to consider that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5), then (0,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), and so on to (0,5). But wait, (0,6) is directly left, same row.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at row 6, column 0. From (5,5), I'd need to move up to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on to (0,6).\n\nThat would take |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves in total from my current position.\n\nBut, if I go for (5,5) first, it's 2 moves, then from there to (0,6), it's 5 moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going directly to (0,6) from (6,6) would be |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 moves.\n\nWait, but going to (5,5) first adds extra moves. Maybe going directly to (0,6) is better in terms of total moves.\n\nBut, (5,5) is closer, so perhaps I should take it first to grow and then aim for (0,6).\n\nHowever, the enemy is closer to (6,1), which is at distance 2 for them, same as my distance to (5,5).\n\nIf I take (5,5), and the enemy takes (6,1), then we both get an apple, and I've grown longer.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can go for (0,6), while the enemy goes for another apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for (8,9), which is farther away but less accessible to the enemy.\n\nFrom (6,6), to (8,9), it's up 3 and right 2, so 5 moves.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (5,0), and to get to (8,9), they'd need to go up 9 and right 3, which is 12 moves.\n\nSo, that might be a safer option, as the enemy would take longer to reach (8,9).\n\nHowever, it's farther for me as well.\n\nLet me consider the risks.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), which is close, and the enemy goes for (6,1), which is also close, we might collide somewhere in the middle if we're both moving towards our chosen apples.\n\nI need to be careful about that.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (8,9), the enemy might not be able to reach it before me, but it's a longer path.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apple that no one else is likely to reach soon.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, medium distance for the enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from both, horizontally for the enemy.\n\n- (9,2): far for both, but closer to the enemy vertically.\n\n- (6,1): close to the enemy, below me.\n\n- (8,9): far from both, but closer to me relatively.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should go for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and I can secure it without interference.\n\nBut, it's also far for me, and I need to make sure that I don't leave too much space for the enemy to maneuver in the meantime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (0,6), which is far from both, but since it's to the left, I need to make sure that I don't run into the wall.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at x=0, which is the leftmost column, so I need to be careful not to go past x=0.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that growing my snake might make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\n\nBut, in this case, since the board is 10x10, and I'm starting from (6,6), I have room to grow.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is right now. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, if I move to (5,6), then my tail will move"

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,6). Wait, in the board state, it shows my position at (6,6), but according to the text, it's at (7,6). There might be a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . .

Maybe there's a confusion between row and column indices. In programming, it's common to refer to positions as (row, column), which corresponds to (Y, X). So, position (6,6) would be row 6, column 6. But in the initial statement, it says the snake is at (7,6), which might be a mistake.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll stick with the board state provided, which places my snake at (6,6).\n\nNow, there are apples at:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,5)\n\nAnd the enemy snake, number 1, is at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so likely just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Enemy's proximity**: Which apple is closest to the enemy snake.\n\n3. **Path clearance**: Ensuring the path to the apple is safe and doesn't lead to collisions.\n\n4. **Board boundaries**: Avoiding walls and ensuring there's room to maneuver.\n\n5. **Future moves**: Planning ahead to the next apple after the current one.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (0,6): |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |6-9| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (8,9): |6-8| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5) with a distance of 2.\n\nNow, let's see how close the enemy is to each apple:\n\nEnemy is at (5,0).\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (5,5): |5-5| + |0-5| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe enemy's closest apple is (6,1), also with a distance of 2.\n\nHmm, so both me and the enemy have apples that are 2 moves away, but they're different apples.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for (5,5) or consider another apple to avoid direct competition with the enemy.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Closest apple.\n\n- Enemy is going for (6,1), which is separate.\n\n- Can quickly secure points.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- If the enemy decides to change path or if their path intersects with mine.\n\nOption 2: Go for (6,1).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Same distance as the enemy, but I might get there first if I move quickly.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- Direct competition with the enemy.\n\n- Riskier due to potential collisions.\n\nOption 3: Go for a farther apple, like (8,9) or (0,6).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Less competition with the enemy.\n\n- Can secure more points if managed properly.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- Longer travel time, during which the enemy could be gaining points.\n\nGiven that (5,5) is the closest and not contested, it seems best to go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the board will have fewer apples, and the enemy might have moved closer to another apple.\n\nLet me plan the path to (5,5):\n\nFrom (6,6) to (5,5):\n\n- Move left to (5,6)\n\n- Move down to (5,5)\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nI need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead to collisions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, moving left to (5,6) is safe; it's currently empty.\n\nThen moving down to (5,5), which has an apple.\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't cause my tail to block my path.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (5,5).\n\nOnce at (5,5), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\nThe enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I should consider that.\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (5,5) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple from (5,5) would be (6,1), but if the enemy has already taken it, I need to choose another one.\n\nAssuming the enemy takes (6,1), then my next best option would be (0,6) at a distance of 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,9) or (9,2), both at distance 7.\n\nBut (0,6) is closer, so perhaps that's a better choice.\n\nWait, but (0,6) is at the left edge, and I need to make sure I don't run into the wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy might be moving towards (9,2) after taking (6,1).\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, maybe after taking (5,5), I should consider going for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and by the time the enemy reaches there, I might already have it.\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might be exposing myself to risks.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to take the closest apple without worrying too much about the enemy, and then assess the situation.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with going to (5,5).\n\nNow, to get there, my first move should be to the left, to (5,6).\n\nThen, move down to (5,5).\n\nBut, in the last move, I moved right, according to the information provided.\n\nWait, the last move information says:\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, but according to the board state, my head is at (6,6), and I need to move left to (5,6).\n\nBut in the last move, I moved right, which would have taken me to (7,6), but according to the board, I'm at (6,6).\n\nThis is confusing.

There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nFactors to consider:\n\n1. Proximity: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. Enemy's proximity: Where is the enemy snake and which apple is closest to it.\n\n3. Path to the apple: Ensure the path is safe and doesn't lead to collisions.\n\n4.

A . . . .\n\nSo, (5,6) is empty, and (5,5) has an apple.\n\nGood, no issues there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a safe path ahead.\n\nAssuming I eat (5,5), my tail will stay in place unless I move forward.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (5,5).\n\nOnce at (5,5), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the enemy might have moved to (4,2) or (9,2).\n\nLet me think ahead.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), possible next apples:\n\n- (8,9): distance from (5,5) is |5-8| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (4,2): depending on enemy's move\n\nAssuming the enemy has taken (4,2), then (0,6) is the next closest at distance 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (0,6) after (5,5).\n\nBut that's a distance of 6 moves.\n\nI need to see if there's a better path or if I should consider another apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (4,2) after (5,5), but if the enemy is already there, that might be dangerous.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just focus on getting to (5,5) first and then assess the situation.\n\nGiven that, my immediate move should be to go up to (5,6).\n\nThen, left to (5,5) to eat the apple.\n\nBut in my last move, I moved right, according to the previous move information.\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved right to (8,6), but according to the board, I'm at (6,6). There's inconsistency here.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the board.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nThe board shows:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . A . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . 1 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . T . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake's head is at (6,5), which is row 6, column 5.\n\nWait, no, it shows '2' at (6,5), which is row 6, column 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the positions are off by one.\n\nWait, in row 6, the sixth character is '2', which is at column 5.\n\nSo, position (6,5) is where my snake's head is.\n\nBut earlier, it was mentioned that I'm at (8,6). There's clearly a confusion here.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll consider the board's representation: I'm at (6,5).\n\nSo, my position is (6,5), not (6,6).\n\nTherefore, the apples are at:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,2)\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,1), with body at (6,0).\n\nNow, to get from (6,5) to (5,5):\n\n- Move up to (5,5)\n\nThat's directly up.\n\nAlternatively, to go to (5,5):\n\n- Move up to (5,5)\n\nSince there's an apple there, that should be safe.\n\nWait, but looking at the board,"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (5,6), which is in row 6, column 5. There's an apple at (5,5), directly below me. Another apple at (8,9), which is up and to the right. There's an apple at (0,6), which is to my left, same row. One at (9,2), which is to the right and down. And one at (6,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): distance is |5-5| + |6-5| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- (0,6): distance is |5-0| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- (9,2): distance is |5-9| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (6,1): distance is |5-6| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (8,9): distance is |5-8| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only one step down.\n\nBut I should also consider if that's the best choice. If I take that apple, I grow longer, which could be good, but I need to make sure I don't get boxed in or hit by the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, if I move down to (5,5), I would be at the apple. Since I grow after eating, my tail will extend, but in this case, since I'm just the head right now, my body will have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (5,6).\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves. After eating the apple at (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (5,5) is directly down. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nWait, but (5,5) is directly down, and there's another apple at (5,5). Wait, no, I'm confused.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly down from me at (5,6). So, if I move down to (5,5), I eat that apple, grow, and then need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple. The apple at (0,6) is now five steps to the left, while the apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nBut, I also need to be aware of the enemy snake at (4,0). It's at the bottom row, column 4. It doesn't have any body parts, so it's probably just the head as well.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake. Since snakes can't occupy the same space, if I'm moving towards an apple, I need to ensure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same apple in a way that would cause a collision.\n\nLet me think about possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (5,5).\n\nMove down from (5,6) to (5,5).\n\nThen, look for the next apple. The apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right, about four steps up and three steps right.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. The closest apple for the enemy might be the one at (6,1), which is up and to the right from its position.\n\nWait, let's calculate the distance for the enemy to each apple:\n\n- (8,9): |4-8| + |0-9| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\n- (0,6): |4-0| + |0-6| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (9,2): |4-9| + |0-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (5,5): |4-5| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nSo, the closest for the enemy is (6,1), which is at distance 3.\n\nTherefore, it might be moving towards (6,1).\n\nIf I go for (5,5), then I need to consider what's next. After eating (5,5), I could potentially go for (0,6), but that's five steps to the left, which might take too much time, and the enemy could reach (6,1) before me.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut, moving to (8,9) would require me to go up three rows and right three columns.\n\nLet's see, from (5,6) to (8,9): up three, right three.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,6):\n\n- Up to (5,7)\n\n- Up to (5,8)\n\n- Up to (5,9)\n\n- Right to (6,9)\n\n- Right to (7,9)\n\n- Right to (8,9)\n\nBut, there's an apple at (8,9), so that's the target.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), directly down.\n\nI need to prioritize.\n\nOption 2: Go for (0,6), which is left five steps, same row.\n\nBut that seems too far, and the enemy might intercept other apples before I can get there.\n\nOption 3: Go for (9,2), which is right four steps and down four steps.\n\nThat seems even farther.\n\nOption 4: Go for (6,1), which is right one and down five.\n\nAgain, that's quite a distance.\n\nOption 5: Go for (8,9), which is up three and right three.\n\nHmm.\n\nConsidering that I can grow by eating apples, perhaps it's better to go for closer apples first to increase my length and make it harder for the enemy to hit me.\n\nBut, longer snakes are also harder to maneuver, so I need to balance growth and agility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for apples that are less accessible to the enemy, to minimize competition.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, not too close to enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from enemy horizontally, but same row.\n\n- (9,2): far to the right and down, enemy would have to move there.\n\n- (6,1): to the right and down, closer to enemy.\n\n- (8,9): up and to the right, far from enemy.\n\nSo, (5,5) and (8,9) seem like good options.\n\nBut (5,5) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I can decide based on the new board state.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (6,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5).

Another apple at (8,9), up and to the right. Apples at (0,6), same row but all the way to the left. At (9,2), right and down. And at (6,1), directly down from me.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (0,6): |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |6-9| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (8,9): |6-8| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. Let's calculate the distances for the enemy:\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (5,5): |5-5| + |0-5| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nSo, the enemy's closest apple is at (6,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple at (6,1) is directly down from me, and it's also the closest to the enemy.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for (5,5), which is closer for me, or maybe aim for another apple to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), it's only 2 moves away, and the enemy is 2 moves away from (6,1). So, I can probably grab (5,5) before the enemy gets to (6,1).\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I'll grow longer, which could be an advantage.\n\nBut, I need to plan my next moves after that. Let's say I go to (5,5). Then, which apple should I go for next?\n\nAt that point, the apples would be at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), and (6,1). The enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I need to consider that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5), then (0,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), and so on to (0,5). But wait, (0,6) is directly left, same row.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at row 6, column 0. From (5,5), I'd need to move up to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on to (0,6).\n\nThat would take |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves in total from my current position.\n\nBut, if I go for (5,5) first, it's 2 moves, then from there to (0,6), it's 5 moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going directly to (0,6) from (6,6) would be |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 moves.\n\nWait, but going to (5,5) first adds extra moves. Maybe going directly to (0,6) is better in terms of total moves.\n\nBut, (5,5) is closer, so perhaps I should take it first to grow and then aim for (0,6).\n\nHowever, the enemy is closer to (6,1), which is at distance 2 for them, same as my distance to (5,5).\n\nIf I take (5,5), and the enemy takes (6,1), then we both get an apple, and I've grown longer.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can go for (0,6), while the enemy goes for another apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for (8,9), which is farther away but less accessible to the enemy.\n\nFrom (6,6), to (8,9), it's up 3 and right 2, so 5 moves.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (5,0), and to get to (8,9), they'd need to go up 9 and right 3, which is 12 moves.\n\nSo, that might be a safer option, as the enemy would take longer to reach (8,9).\n\nHowever, it's farther for me as well.\n\nLet me consider the risks.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), which is close, and the enemy goes for (6,1), which is also close, we might collide somewhere in the middle if we're both moving towards our chosen apples.\n\nI need to be careful about that.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (8,9), the enemy might not be able to reach it before me, but it's a longer path.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apple that no one else is likely to reach soon.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, medium distance for the enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from both, horizontally for the enemy.\n\n- (9,2): far for both, but closer to the enemy vertically.\n\n- (6,1): close to the enemy, below me.\n\n- (8,9): far from both, but closer to me relatively.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should go for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and I can secure it without interference.\n\nBut, it's also far for me, and I need to make sure that I don't leave too much space for the enemy to maneuver in the meantime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (0,6), which is far from both, but since it's to the left, I need to make sure that I don't run into the wall.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at x=0, which is the leftmost column, so I need to be careful not to go past x=0.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that growing my snake might make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\n\nBut, in this case, since the board is 10x10, and I'm starting from (6,6), I have room to grow.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is right now. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, if I move to (5,6), then my tail will move"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,6). Wait, in the board state, it shows my position at (6,6), but according to the text, it's at (7,6). There might be a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . .

A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . 1 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, row 6, column 6 has my snake's head, which is position (6,6). But earlier it was mentioned that my snake is at (7,6). Maybe there's a confusion between row and column indices. In programming, it's common to refer to positions as (row, column), which corresponds to (Y, X). So, position (6,6) would be row 6, column 6. But in the initial statement, it says the snake is at (7,6), which might be a mistake.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll stick with the board state provided, which places my snake at (6,6).\n\nNow, there are apples at:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,5)\n\nAnd the enemy snake, number 1, is at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so likely just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Enemy's proximity**: Which apple is closest to the enemy snake.\n\n3. **Path clearance**: Ensuring the path to the apple is safe and doesn't lead to collisions.\n\n4. **Board boundaries**: Avoiding walls and ensuring there's room to maneuver.\n\n5. **Future moves**: Planning ahead to the next apple after the current one.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (0,6): |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |6-9| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (8,9): |6-8| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5) with a distance of 2.\n\nNow, let's see how close the enemy is to each apple:\n\nEnemy is at (5,0).\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (5,5): |5-5| + |0-5| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe enemy's closest apple is (6,1), also with a distance of 2.\n\nHmm, so both me and the enemy have apples that are 2 moves away, but they're different apples.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for (5,5) or consider another apple to avoid direct competition with the enemy.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Closest apple.\n\n- Enemy is going for (6,1), which is separate.\n\n- Can quickly secure points.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- If the enemy decides to change path or if their path intersects with mine.\n\nOption 2: Go for (6,1).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Same distance as the enemy, but I might get there first if I move quickly.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- Direct competition with the enemy.\n\n- Riskier due to potential collisions.\n\nOption 3: Go for a farther apple, like (8,9) or (0,6).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Less competition with the enemy.\n\n- Can secure more points if managed properly.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- Longer travel time, during which the enemy could be gaining points.\n\nGiven that (5,5) is the closest and not contested, it seems best to go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the board will have fewer apples, and the enemy might have moved closer to another apple.\n\nLet me plan the path to (5,5):\n\nFrom (6,6) to (5,5):\n\n- Move left to (5,6)\n\n- Move down to (5,5)\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nI need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead to collisions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, moving left to (5,6) is safe; it's currently empty.\n\nThen moving down to (5,5), which has an apple.\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't cause my tail to block my path.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (5,5).\n\nOnce at (5,5), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\nThe enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I should consider that.\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (5,5) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple from (5,5) would be (6,1), but if the enemy has already taken it, I need to choose another one.\n\nAssuming the enemy takes (6,1), then my next best option would be (0,6) at a distance of 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,9) or (9,2), both at distance 7.\n\nBut (0,6) is closer, so perhaps that's a better choice.\n\nWait, but (0,6) is at the left edge, and I need to make sure I don't run into the wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy might be moving towards (9,2) after taking (6,1).\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, maybe after taking (5,5), I should consider going for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and by the time the enemy reaches there, I might already have it.\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might be exposing myself to risks.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to take the closest apple without worrying too much about the enemy, and then assess the situation.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with going to (5,5).\n\nNow, to get there, my first move should be to the left, to (5,6).\n\nThen, move down to (5,5).\n\nBut, in the last move, I moved right, according to the information provided.\n\nWait, the last move information says:\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, but according to the board state, my head is at (6,6), and I need to move left to (5,6).\n\nBut in the last move, I moved right, which would have taken me to (7,6), but according to the board, I'm at (6,6).\n\nThis is confusing.

A .\n\nSo, (8,8) is empty, and (8,9) has an apple.\n\nGood, no issues there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,9), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a safe path ahead.\n\nAssuming I eat (8,9), my tail will stay in place unless I move forward.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nOnce at (8,9), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the enemy might have moved to (9,2) or (4,2).\n\nLet me think ahead.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), possible next apples:\n\n- (5,5): distance from (8,9) is |8-5| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,6): |8-0| + |9-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |8-9| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (4,2): |8-4| + |9-2| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is (5,5) at distance 7.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (9,2), but it's farther at distance 8.\n\nBut considering the enemy might be moving towards (9,2), it might be safer to go for (5,5).\n\nSo, after eating (8,9), I should plan a path to (5,5).\n\nBut for now, my immediate goal is to get to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to move right to (8,8).\n\nThen, next turn, move up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure that moving right to (8,8) doesn't put me in danger.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nAt (8,8), there's nothing, and (8,9) is the apple.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,1), which is far away from my path to (8,9).\n\nSo, it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move right to (8,8).\n\n**Final Move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (4,0), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (5,6), which is in row 6, column 5. There's an apple at (5,5), directly below me. Another apple at (8,9), which is up and to the right. There's an apple at (0,6), which is to my left, same row. One at (9,2), which is to the right and down. And one at (6,1), which is down and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): distance is |5-5| + |6-5| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- (0,6): distance is |5-0| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- (9,2): distance is |5-9| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (6,1): distance is |5-6| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (8,9): distance is |5-8| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only one step down.\n\nBut I should also consider if that's the best choice. If I take that apple, I grow longer, which could be good, but I need to make sure I don't get boxed in or hit by the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, if I move down to (5,5), I would be at the apple. Since I grow after eating, my tail will extend, but in this case, since I'm just the head right now, my body will have one segment.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (5,6).\n\nNow, I need to plan my next moves. After eating the apple at (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (5,5) is directly down. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nWait, but (5,5) is directly down, and there's another apple at (5,5). Wait, no, I'm confused.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is directly down from me at (5,6). So, if I move down to (5,5), I eat that apple, grow, and then need to decide where to go next.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I should look for the next closest apple. The apple at (0,6) is now five steps to the left, while the apple at (8,9) is up and to the right.\n\nBut, I also need to be aware of the enemy snake at (4,0). It's at the bottom row, column 4. It doesn't have any body parts, so it's probably just the head as well.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake. Since snakes can't occupy the same space, if I'm moving towards an apple, I need to ensure that the enemy isn't moving towards the same apple in a way that would cause a collision.\n\nLet me think about possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (5,5).\n\nMove down from (5,6) to (5,5).\n\nThen, look for the next apple. The apple at (0,6) is to the left, five steps away. The apple at (8,9) is up and to the right, about four steps up and three steps right.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. The closest apple for the enemy might be the one at (6,1), which is up and to the right from its position.\n\nWait, let's calculate the distance for the enemy to each apple:\n\n- (8,9): |4-8| + |0-9| = 4 + 9 = 13\n\n- (0,6): |4-0| + |0-6| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- (9,2): |4-9| + |0-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |4-6| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (5,5): |4-5| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\nSo, the closest for the enemy is (6,1), which is at distance 3.\n\nTherefore, it might be moving towards (6,1).\n\nIf I go for (5,5), then I need to consider what's next. After eating (5,5), I could potentially go for (0,6), but that's five steps to the left, which might take too much time, and the enemy could reach (6,1) before me.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (8,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut, moving to (8,9) would require me to go up three rows and right three columns.\n\nLet's see, from (5,6) to (8,9): up three, right three.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,6):\n\n- Up to (5,7)\n\n- Up to (5,8)\n\n- Up to (5,9)\n\n- Right to (6,9)\n\n- Right to (7,9)\n\n- Right to (8,9)\n\nBut, there's an apple at (8,9), so that's the target.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (5,5), directly down.\n\nI need to prioritize.\n\nOption 2: Go for (0,6), which is left five steps, same row.\n\nBut that seems too far, and the enemy might intercept other apples before I can get there.\n\nOption 3: Go for (9,2), which is right four steps and down four steps.\n\nThat seems even farther.\n\nOption 4: Go for (6,1), which is right one and down five.\n\nAgain, that's quite a distance.\n\nOption 5: Go for (8,9), which is up three and right three.\n\nHmm.\n\nConsidering that I can grow by eating apples, perhaps it's better to go for closer apples first to increase my length and make it harder for the enemy to hit me.\n\nBut, longer snakes are also harder to maneuver, so I need to balance growth and agility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for apples that are less accessible to the enemy, to minimize competition.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, not too close to enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from enemy horizontally, but same row.\n\n- (9,2): far to the right and down, enemy would have to move there.\n\n- (6,1): to the right and down, closer to enemy.\n\n- (8,9): up and to the right, far from enemy.\n\nSo, (5,5) and (8,9) seem like good options.\n\nBut (5,5) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I can decide based on the new board state.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (5,"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (6,6). There are apples at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), (6,1), and (5,5). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head for now.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . .

Another apple at (8,9), up and to the right. Apples at (0,6), same row but all the way to the left. At (9,2), right and down. And at (6,1), directly down from me.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the distance to each apple and potential risks from the enemy snake.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (0,6): |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |6-9| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (8,9): |6-8| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,0), and it's probably going to move towards the nearest apple as well. Let's calculate the distances for the enemy:\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (5,5): |5-5| + |0-5| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nSo, the enemy's closest apple is at (6,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple at (6,1) is directly down from me, and it's also the closest to the enemy.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for (5,5), which is closer for me, or maybe aim for another apple to avoid competition with the enemy.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), it's only 2 moves away, and the enemy is 2 moves away from (6,1). So, I can probably grab (5,5) before the enemy gets to (6,1).\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I'll grow longer, which could be an advantage.\n\nBut, I need to plan my next moves after that. Let's say I go to (5,5). Then, which apple should I go for next?\n\nAt that point, the apples would be at (8,9), (0,6), (9,2), and (6,1). The enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I need to consider that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5), then (0,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then (3,5), and so on to (0,5). But wait, (0,6) is directly left, same row.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at row 6, column 0. From (5,5), I'd need to move up to (5,6), then left to (4,6), and so on to (0,6).\n\nThat would take |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves in total from my current position.\n\nBut, if I go for (5,5) first, it's 2 moves, then from there to (0,6), it's 5 moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, going directly to (0,6) from (6,6) would be |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 moves.\n\nWait, but going to (5,5) first adds extra moves. Maybe going directly to (0,6) is better in terms of total moves.\n\nBut, (5,5) is closer, so perhaps I should take it first to grow and then aim for (0,6).\n\nHowever, the enemy is closer to (6,1), which is at distance 2 for them, same as my distance to (5,5).\n\nIf I take (5,5), and the enemy takes (6,1), then we both get an apple, and I've grown longer.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can go for (0,6), while the enemy goes for another apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't get boxed in or collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for (8,9), which is farther away but less accessible to the enemy.\n\nFrom (6,6), to (8,9), it's up 3 and right 2, so 5 moves.\n\nBut, the enemy is at (5,0), and to get to (8,9), they'd need to go up 9 and right 3, which is 12 moves.\n\nSo, that might be a safer option, as the enemy would take longer to reach (8,9).\n\nHowever, it's farther for me as well.\n\nLet me consider the risks.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), which is close, and the enemy goes for (6,1), which is also close, we might collide somewhere in the middle if we're both moving towards our chosen apples.\n\nI need to be careful about that.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (8,9), the enemy might not be able to reach it before me, but it's a longer path.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apple that no one else is likely to reach soon.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,5): close to me, medium distance for the enemy.\n\n- (0,6): far from both, horizontally for the enemy.\n\n- (9,2): far for both, but closer to the enemy vertically.\n\n- (6,1): close to the enemy, below me.\n\n- (8,9): far from both, but closer to me relatively.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should go for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and I can secure it without interference.\n\nBut, it's also far for me, and I need to make sure that I don't leave too much space for the enemy to maneuver in the meantime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (0,6), which is far from both, but since it's to the left, I need to make sure that I don't run into the wall.\n\nWait, (0,6) is at x=0, which is the leftmost column, so I need to be careful not to go past x=0.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that growing my snake might make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\n\nBut, in this case, since the board is 10x10, and I'm starting from (6,6), I have room to grow.\n\nWait, actually, I don't know how long my snake is right now. The problem says \"your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,6)\", but it doesn't specify the length. Maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nAssuming it's just the head, then moving to (5,5) will make my snake have two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (6,6).\n\nAfter that, if I move to (5,6), then my tail will move"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,6). Wait, in the board state, it shows my position at (6,6), but according to the text, it's at (7,6). There might be a discrepancy here. Let me check the board state again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . .

A . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . 1 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, row 6, column 6 has my snake's head, which is position (6,6). But earlier it was mentioned that my snake is at (7,6). Maybe there's a confusion between row and column indices. In programming, it's common to refer to positions as (row, column), which corresponds to (Y, X). So, position (6,6) would be row 6, column 6. But in the initial statement, it says the snake is at (7,6), which might be a mistake.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll stick with the board state provided, which places my snake at (6,6).\n\nNow, there are apples at:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,5)\n\nAnd the enemy snake, number 1, is at (5,0), with no body parts listed, so likely just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Enemy's proximity**: Which apple is closest to the enemy snake.\n\n3. **Path clearance**: Ensuring the path to the apple is safe and doesn't lead to collisions.\n\n4. **Board boundaries**: Avoiding walls and ensuring there's room to maneuver.\n\n5. **Future moves**: Planning ahead to the next apple after the current one.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- (5,5): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (0,6): |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |6-9| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- (8,9): |6-8| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5) with a distance of 2.\n\nNow, let's see how close the enemy is to each apple:\n\nEnemy is at (5,0).\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- (5,5): |5-5| + |0-5| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe enemy's closest apple is (6,1), also with a distance of 2.\n\nHmm, so both me and the enemy have apples that are 2 moves away, but they're different apples.\n\nI need to decide whether to go for (5,5) or consider another apple to avoid direct competition with the enemy.\n\nOption 1: Go for (5,5).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Closest apple.\n\n- Enemy is going for (6,1), which is separate.\n\n- Can quickly secure points.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- If the enemy decides to change path or if their path intersects with mine.\n\nOption 2: Go for (6,1).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Same distance as the enemy, but I might get there first if I move quickly.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- Direct competition with the enemy.\n\n- Riskier due to potential collisions.\n\nOption 3: Go for a farther apple, like (8,9) or (0,6).\n\n- Pros:\n\n- Less competition with the enemy.\n\n- Can secure more points if managed properly.\n\n- Cons:\n\n- Longer travel time, during which the enemy could be gaining points.\n\nGiven that (5,5) is the closest and not contested, it seems best to go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the board will have fewer apples, and the enemy might have moved closer to another apple.\n\nLet me plan the path to (5,5):\n\nFrom (6,6) to (5,5):\n\n- Move left to (5,6)\n\n- Move down to (5,5)\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nI need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead to collisions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: A . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, moving left to (5,6) is safe; it's currently empty.\n\nThen moving down to (5,5), which has an apple.\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that the next move doesn't cause my tail to block my path.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (5,5).\n\nOnce at (5,5), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\nThe enemy might have taken (6,1) by then, so I should consider that.\n\nLet's calculate the distances from (5,5) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |5-8| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,6): |5-0| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- (9,2): |5-9| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple from (5,5) would be (6,1), but if the enemy has already taken it, I need to choose another one.\n\nAssuming the enemy takes (6,1), then my next best option would be (0,6) at a distance of 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,9) or (9,2), both at distance 7.\n\nBut (0,6) is closer, so perhaps that's a better choice.\n\nWait, but (0,6) is at the left edge, and I need to make sure I don't run into the wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy might be moving towards (9,2) after taking (6,1).\n\nI need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider a different sequence.\n\nWait, maybe after taking (5,5), I should consider going for (8,9), as it's far from the enemy, and by the time the enemy reaches there, I might already have it.\n\nBut that's a longer path, and I might be exposing myself to risks.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to take the closest apple without worrying too much about the enemy, and then assess the situation.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with going to (5,5).\n\nNow, to get there, my first move should be to the left, to (5,6).\n\nThen, move down to (5,5).\n\nBut, in the last move, I moved right, according to the information provided.\n\nWait, the last move information says:\n\nDirection: RIGHT\n\nRationale: ...\n\nWait, but according to the board state, my head is at (6,6), and I need to move left to (5,6).\n\nBut in the last move, I moved right, which would have taken me to (7,6), but according to the board, I'm at (6,6).\n\nThis is confusing.

A .\n\nSo, (8,8) is empty, and (8,9) has an apple.\n\nGood, no issues there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,9), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a safe path ahead.\n\nAssuming I eat (8,9), my tail will stay in place unless I move forward.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (8,9).\n\nOnce at (8,9), I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nAt that point, the enemy might have moved to (9,2) or (4,2).\n\nLet me think ahead.\n\nAfter eating (8,9), possible next apples:\n\n- (5,5): distance from (8,9) is |8-5| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,6): |8-0| + |9-6| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\n- (9,2): |8-9| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (4,2): |8-4| + |9-2| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is (5,5) at distance 7.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (9,2), but it's farther at distance 8.\n\nBut considering the enemy might be moving towards (9,2), it might be safer to go for (5,5).\n\nSo, after eating (8,9), I should plan a path to (5,5).\n\nBut for now, my immediate goal is to get to (8,9).\n\nTherefore, my next move should be to move right to (8,8).\n\nThen, next turn, move up to (8,9) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure that moving right to (8,8) doesn't put me in danger.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nAt (8,8), there's nothing, and (8,9) is the apple.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,1), which is far away from my path to (8,9).\n\nSo, it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move right to (8,8).\n\n**Final Move: RIGHT**"

This remains the closest apple, and my path to it is still clear of obstacles. There's no immediate threat from any of the enemy snakes in this direction.\n\n### Analysis of the Board and Proximity to Apples:\n\n- **Current Position**: (8, 1)\n- **Target Apple**: (9, 2)\n  - Just one RIGHT move away, putting me directly at (9, 2) and allowing me to collect the apple and grow.\n- **Other Apples**: \n  - (5, 5), (4, 2), (0, 6), and (8, 9) are still further away and will be considered after collecting the apple at (9, 2).\n\n- **Enemy Snake #2**: \n  - At position (9, 7), it doesn\u2019t pose any immediate threat to my current trajectory toward (9, 2).\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n\n1. **Immediate Objective**:\n   - Move RIGHT to collect the apple at (9, 2). This move is direct, safe, and achieves the immediate goal of collecting a point and growing the snake.\n   \n2. **Movement Safety**:\n   - Given that the board position at (9, 2) and the path via (9, 1) are unoccupied, this move is completely safe from any collisions.\n   \n3. **Long-Term Strategy**:\n   - After moving to (9, 2), reassess the board to determine the optimal path to the next closest apple.\n   - Keep an eye on Snake #2\u2019s movements. If it starts moving downwards, plan for evasion or block potential.\n   \n### Decision:\n\nSince the apple at (9, 2) is the closest and there\u2019s no immediate threat, I'll move RIGHT to collect the apple.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right. That means Y increases as you go up, and X increases as you go right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,7). But looking at the board state, it seems like there might be a confusion with row and column indices. In the board, my position is shown at (7,8), which is row 7, column 8. So maybe the coordinates are (Y,X) instead of (X,Y). I need to clarify that.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: positions Y=9\n\n- Row 0: positions Y=0\n\n- Columns 0 to 9: X=0 to X=9\n\nSo, position (7,8) is row 7, column 8.\n\nBut earlier it said I'm at (8,7). Maybe there's a mistake. To avoid confusion, I'll consider the board's representation: I'm at (7,8).\n\nNow, there are apples at:\n\n- (8,9)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,2)\n\nAnd there's an enemy snake at (7,1), with its body at (6,1).\n\nSo, enemy snake's head is at (7,1), and it has one body part at (6,1).\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to avoid colliding with the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I need to prioritize.\n\nFactors to consider:\n\n1. Proximity: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2.
