Similarly, the apple at (5, 1) is directly below me but would require a lot of downward movement.\n\n2. **Avoid Collisions:**\n   - Snake #2 is at (2, 6) with no body, so it poses less immediate threat except for head-on collision.\n\n3. **Strategize Movement:**\n   - Moving towards (5, 1) seems like a viable option if I proceed downwards. This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically. This should also keep me away from the edges temporarily, allowing for more strategic options in subsequent moves.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1) while staying clear of any immediate collisions.

The apple at (2, 5) is the closest one, and if I move up (y-1), I can reach it.\n\nHowever, there's a potential risk of collision with Snake #1, which is at (5, 6). To avoid this, I should move in a direction that minimizes the chance of crossing paths with it. In this case, moving up (y-1) would bring me closer to Snake #1, so it's not the best option.\n\nInstead, I'll choose to move right (x+1) to reach the apple at (3, 6) and avoid Snake #1.

The various apples available are spread out across the board, and my recent strategical assessments have encouraged me to pursue the apple located at (5, 1).

This move will provide a direct path to an apple without immediate lateral adjustment, decreasing the time to gain points.\n   - Maintaining a central board position is beneficial for future moves as it allows flexibility to reach other apples promptly.\n\n4. **Immediate Game Plan:**\n   - I will move in the same direction as my last move, moving **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1).

This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically.

Similarly, the apple at (5, 1) is directly below me but would require a lot of downward movement.\n\n2. **Avoid Collisions:**\n   - Snake #2 is at (2, 6) with no body, so it poses less immediate threat except for head-on collision.\n\n3. **Strategize Movement:**\n   - Moving towards (5, 1) seems like a viable option if I proceed downwards. This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically. This should also keep me away from the edges temporarily, allowing for more strategic options in subsequent moves.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1) while staying clear of any immediate collisions.

The various apples available are spread out across the board, and my recent strategical assessments have encouraged me to pursue the apple located at (5, 1).

This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically. This should also keep me away from the edges temporarily, allowing for more strategic options in subsequent moves.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1) while staying clear of any immediate collisions.

This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically.

Similarly, the apple at (5, 1) is directly below me but would require a lot of downward movement.\n\n2. **Avoid Collisions:**\n   - Snake #2 is at (2, 6) with no body, so it poses less immediate threat except for head-on collision.\n\n3. **Strategize Movement:**\n   - Moving towards (5, 1) seems like a viable option if I proceed downwards. This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically. This should also keep me away from the edges temporarily, allowing for more strategic options in subsequent moves.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1) while staying clear of any immediate collisions.

Similarly, the apple at (5, 1) is directly below me but would require a lot of downward movement.\n\n2. **Avoid Collisions:**\n   - Snake #2 is at (2, 6) with no body, so it poses less immediate threat except for head-on collision.\n\n3. **Strategize Movement:**\n   - Moving towards (5, 1) seems like a viable option if I proceed downwards. This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically. This should also keep me away from the edges temporarily, allowing for more strategic options in subsequent moves.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1) while staying clear of any immediate collisions.

It\u2019s an attractive target because it's not too far, and collecting it will keep me away from the immediate edges.\n2. **(4, 0):** This apple is directly below me, just one move downwards.

The apples are located at various points and earning a point by eating one would be beneficial. Here's my plan:\n\n1. **Assess Nearby Apples:**\n   - Closest apples based on my position are:\n     - (2, 4)\n     - (5, 1)\n     - (0, 2)\n     - (4, 0)\n     - (0, 7)\n\n   The apple at (0, 7) is the nearest in terms of vertical movement but would require significant lateral movement as well. Similarly, the apple at (5, 1) is directly below me but would require a lot of downward movement.\n\n2. **Avoid Collisions:**\n   - Snake #2 is at (2, 6) with no body, so it poses less immediate threat except for head-on collision.\n\n3. **Strategize Movement:**\n   - Moving towards (5, 1) seems like a viable option if I proceed downwards. This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically. This should also keep me away from the edges temporarily, allowing for more strategic options in subsequent moves.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1) while staying clear of any immediate collisions.

The various apples available are spread out across the board, and my recent strategical assessments have encouraged me to pursue the apple located at (5, 1).

This move will provide a direct path to an apple without immediate lateral adjustment, decreasing the time to gain points.\n   - Maintaining a central board position is beneficial for future moves as it allows flexibility to reach other apples promptly.\n\n4. **Immediate Game Plan:**\n   - I will move in the same direction as my last move, moving **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1). This strategic direction simplifies my decision-making by focusing only on vertical movement right now.\n\n### Future Strategy Insight\nI should remain mindful of the other snake's movements. The plan is to keep positioning myself in a flexible position to respond to remaining apples without getting too close to risky edges.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **DOWN** toward the apple at (5, 1) to continue on an efficient path to score and maintain central board control."

This path also keeps me in the middle of the board, reducing the risk of hitting walls.\n\n4. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - Watch out for collision with Snake #2, but since it has no body, I mainly need to avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Keep some distance from the boundaries to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Strategic Insight\nGiven my current position at (5, 6), I should aim for the apple at (5, 1) next as it's directly below and requires straightforward movement vertically. This should also keep me away from the edges temporarily, allowing for more strategic options in subsequent moves.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **DOWN** towards the apple at (5, 1) while staying clear of any immediate collisions.

The apple at (0, 2) is relatively nearby.\n2. **Direction Consideration:** To move towards the apple at (0, 2), I should consider moving LEFT.\n\n3. **Future Consideration:** Moving left also positions me closer to other apples on the left row. I'll need to keep observing Snake #2\u2019s movements and adapt accordingly.\n\n### Risk Assessment and Planning\n- There is no immediate threat, so a move towards the closest apple at (0, 2) is prudent.\n- Aiming towards the centrality of the board could ensure more accessible apple acquisitions in future moves.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward\n- As I'm moving towards the apple at (0, 2), I should prepare to shift strategies based on Snake #2's position. Staying aware of any changes in its movements is crucial.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **LEFT** to (3, 3) as it positions me closer to (0, 2) safely without immediate threats.\n\nDecided Move: **LEFT**"

It's still the closest apple and should be my primary target.\n- **(0, 7):** Still distant and requires navigating vertically and horizontally.\n- **(0, 3):** Three units directly to the left.\n- **(3, 9):** Still very high up and not a current priority.\n- **(1, 4):** Two units to the left and one unit up, potentially reachable after gathering the apple at (0, 2).\n\n#### Threat Evaluation\n- **Snake #2** is at position (4, 9), far from my current location and poses no direct threat at the moment.\n- There is still nothing in the immediate path other than the apples, allowing me to move freely without collision risk.\n\n### Immediate Strategy\n1. **Current Priority:** The apple at (0, 2) is still the most accessible and provides a clear path without risk.\n2. **Direction Consideration:** Heading LEFT remains the logical choice to move closer to (0, 2).\n\n3. **Future Consideration:** Collecting the apple at (0, 3) or maneuvering upwards becomes viable after reaching (0, 2).\n\n### Risk Assessment and Planning\n- Movement towards (0, 2) continues to minimize risks while maximizing our scoring opportunity.\n- Monitoring Snake #2 remains crucial, though its distance suggests it's not an immediate issue.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward\n- Focus on collecting apples efficiently, beginning with (0, 2).\n- Keep flexibility to redirect towards other nearby apples or avoid Snake #2 if it shifts closer.\n\n### Decided Move\nMove **LEFT** to (2, 3). This positions me closer to (0, 2) without any immediate threats.\n\nDecided Move: **LEFT**"

My goal is to eat the apple while avoiding collision with Snake #1 and staying away from the wall at the left side (x=0). Since Snake #1 is currently moving downwards, it is possible that it may move towards the apple at (0, 2) in its next turn. To avoid a potential collision and stay away from the wall, I will move leftwards (LEFT) to create some distance from Snake #1 and stay safe from the wall.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
