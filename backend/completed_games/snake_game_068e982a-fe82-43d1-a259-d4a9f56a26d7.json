If I go downward, I'll be at (8,7) which is closer to the apple at (7,6). It's also far from snake #2's current position, meaning there's less of a chance of running into it. I could also potentially go for the apple at (8,7), by moving right then down but it's too close to the enemy snake and might cause a collision. So, I will make a move downward.\nThe strategy for the next turn will be to evaluate the enemy snake's position again and plan accordingly to avoid any collision while securing an apple. \n\nNext move: DOWN."
