Moving DOWN would bring me closer to enemy snake - risky\n\nThe apple at (5, 7) looks most promising as:\n- It's one of the closest (distance 5)\n- It's in a good central position\n- Getting there won't trap me against walls\n\nI'll move RIGHT this time because:\n1. It begins my approach to (5, 7)\n2. Still maintains safe distance from enemy snake\n3. Gives me flexibility to change plans if needed\n4.
