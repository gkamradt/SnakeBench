Given the current positions, it's more rational to aim for the apple at (1,6), as the enemy snake can't easily capture this apple without running into a wall or itself. From now onwards, I have to watch out for the enemy snake.\n\nCurrent Strategy: Proceed to the LEFT and aim for the apple at (1,6).
