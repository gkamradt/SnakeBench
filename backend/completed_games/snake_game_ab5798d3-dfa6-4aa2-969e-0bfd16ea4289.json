Let's evaluate the possible moves:\n\n1. **UP to (7, 6):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (7, 6) is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. There are no immediate threats from enemy snakes or obstacles in this direction.\n   - **Opportunity:** Moving up positions me closer to the apple at (7, 7). Continuing this direction could allow me to collect the apple in the subsequent move, increasing my score and length.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (7, 4) is currently occupied by my snake's tail. Moving into it might be risky, as it could lead to a collision, especially if the tail doesn't move away in time.\n   - **Opportunity:** This move doesn't offer any strategic advantage and could potentially lead to a loss if a collision occurs.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (6, 5) is unoccupied and safe to move into.\n   - **Opportunity:** Moving left doesn't bring me closer to any available apples. It might also limit access to the apple at (7, 7), making future moves more restrictive.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (8, 5) is unoccupied and within the board boundaries.\n   - **Opportunity:** Moving right doesn't align me with any available apples and brings me closer to the board's edge, which might restrict future movement options.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nPrioritizing upward movement towards the apple at (7, 7) is advantageous. By moving up, I position myself to collect the apple in the next move, thereby increasing my score and length. Maintaining a central position on the board reduces the risk of getting trapped by enemy snakes or board edges and keeps multiple pathways open for future movements.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"

Additionally, securing this apple reduces competition for nearby resources.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 5):**\n   - **Safety:** Moving back to (7, 5) would retrace my last move.
