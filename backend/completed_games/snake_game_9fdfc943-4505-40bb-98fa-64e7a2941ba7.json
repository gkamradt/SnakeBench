Considering the placement of the snake on an open board, moving toward unthreatened apples like (9, 6) or (3, 5) will be ideal.\n  - Maintaining flexibility in movement is critical. I may choose either to continue upwards or start moving towards the right to set a path to the next objective apple.\n\n**Strategic Thoughts for Next Turn:**\n\n- After capturing the apple at (7, 4), assess the board for open pathways to my next apple objective.\n- Avoid overcommitting to a single direction to maintain maneuverability.\n- Consider the apple at (9, 6) next as it is in an open area and away from the row where enemy snake #2 is located.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP to the apple at (7, 4).\n\n**Next Move: UP**"
