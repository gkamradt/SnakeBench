Since the snake is currently at (6, 7) and the last move was DOWN, the next move should continue in the same direction to collect the apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apple, we need to consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake. The apple at (7, 2) is the closest one, but moving towards it would require careful planning to avoid the enemy snake, which is currently at (2, 8) with a body segment at (3, 8). It's important to note that the enemy snake could potentially move towards the apple at (1, 9) or (1, 0), or it could turn towards the center of the board.\n\nGiven these considerations, a prudent strategy would be to collect the apple at (7, 2) by moving right first to avoid any immediate confrontation with the enemy snake. This would also position us to more easily reach the apples at (9, 1) and (1, 0) after collecting the one at (7, 2).\n\nHere's the strategy after collecting the apple at (6, 5):\n1.

Since the snake is currently at (6, 7) and the last move was DOWN, the next move should continue in the same direction to collect the apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apple, we need to consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake. The apple at (7, 2) is the closest one, but moving towards it would require careful planning to avoid the enemy snake, which is currently at (2, 8) with a body segment at (3, 8). It's important to note that the enemy snake could potentially move towards the apple at (1, 9) or (1, 0), or it could turn towards the center of the board.\n\nGiven these considerations, a prudent strategy would be to collect the apple at (7, 2) by moving right first to avoid any immediate confrontation with the enemy snake. This would also position us to more easily reach the apples at (9, 1) and (1, 0) after collecting the one at (7, 2).\n\nHere's the strategy after collecting the apple at (6, 5):\n1. Move RIGHT to avoid the enemy snake's current path.\n2. Head towards the apple at (7, 2) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n3.

Here's the breakdown of the situation:\n\n- The closest apple to us is at (7, 2).\n- The enemy snake (Snake #1) is currently at (1, 7) and moving down to collect the apple at (1, 0) would be risky as it might move towards it as well.\n- We are currently at (7, 6) facing left after the last move.\n\nThe enemy snake is not in our immediate path, so we have an opportunity to safely collect the apple at (7, 2). To do this, we should move down to (7, 5) on this turn, which will position us directly above the apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (7, 2), we should then consider moving towards the apple at (6, 5). However, we must be cautious not to move directly into the path of the enemy snake which could potentially move towards that apple as well.\n\nTherefore, the next move is:\n\nDOWN to position at (7, 5).\n\nAfter this move, we will be in a position to collect the apple at (7, 2) on the next turn. We should then evaluate the enemy snake's position and decide whether to move towards the apple at (6, 5) or to another safe location on the board.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

Our current position is (6, 8), and moving directly down towards the apple at (7, 2) would put us in danger of running into Snake #1 if it moves towards us.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move is to first move away from Snake #1 and position ourselves to collect the apple at (7, 2) without risking a collision. We should move up to (5, 8), which puts us at a safe distance from Snake #1 and aligns us with the apple at (7, 2) for a subsequent rightward move.\n\nHere's the updated plan:\n1. Move up to (5, 8) to distance ourselves from Snake #1.\n2. On the next turn, move right to (6, 8), then continue moving right to (7, 8).\n3. Finally, move down twice to collect the apple at (7, 2) on the subsequent turn.\n\nBy following this plan, we will safely collect the apple at (7, 2) and can then reassess the board for additional apples to target.\n\nSo, my next move is: UP."

Since the snake is currently at (6, 7) and the last move was DOWN, the next move should continue in the same direction to collect the apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apple, we need to consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake. The apple at (7, 2) is the closest one, but moving towards it would require careful planning to avoid the enemy snake, which is currently at (2, 8) with a body segment at (3, 8). It's important to note that the enemy snake could potentially move towards the apple at (1, 9) or (1, 0), or it could turn towards the center of the board.\n\nGiven these considerations, a prudent strategy would be to collect the apple at (7, 2) by moving right first to avoid any immediate confrontation with the enemy snake. This would also position us to more easily reach the apples at (9, 1) and (1, 0) after collecting the one at (7, 2).\n\nHere's the strategy after collecting the apple at (6, 5):\n1. Move RIGHT to avoid the enemy snake's current path.\n2. Head towards the apple at (7, 2) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n3.

Since the snake is currently at (6, 7) and the last move was DOWN, the next move should continue in the same direction to collect the apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apple, we need to consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake. The apple at (7, 2) is the closest one, but moving towards it would require careful planning to avoid the enemy snake, which is currently at (2, 8) with a body segment at (3, 8). It's important to note that the enemy snake could potentially move towards the apple at (1, 9) or (1, 0), or it could turn towards the center of the board.\n\nGiven these considerations, a prudent strategy would be to collect the apple at (7, 2) by moving right first to avoid any immediate confrontation with the enemy snake. This would also position us to more easily reach the apples at (9, 1) and (1, 0) after collecting the one at (7, 2).\n\nHere's the strategy after collecting the apple at (6, 5):\n1. Move RIGHT to avoid the enemy snake's current path.\n2. Head towards the apple at (7, 2) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n3.
