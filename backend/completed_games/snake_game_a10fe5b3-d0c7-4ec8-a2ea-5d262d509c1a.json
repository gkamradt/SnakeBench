The nearest part of the enemy snake is at (6, 8), which is far from my location. \n\n### Possible Moves from (1, 2):\n1. **Move UP to (1, 3)**: This cell is empty, and while it\u2019s safe, it doesn't help me towards getting an apple immediately.\n  \n2. **Move DOWN to (1, 1)**: This cell is also empty but does not lead to the objective of getting an apple.\n  \n3. **Move LEFT to (0, 2)**: This cell contains an apple! Moving here would earn me a point and grow my snake.\n  \n4. **Move RIGHT to (2, 2)**: This cell is where I came from and would result in backtracking, which is not advisable.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n- The best and obvious choice is to move LEFT to (0, 2) to collect the apple and grow my snake. It\u2019s also the closest apple to my location.\n  \n- Since this is a direct route to an apple and does not involve any risks of colliding with another snake or out-of-bounds areas, it aligns perfectly with my objective of maximizing points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Given the situation, the decision is straightforward.\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

Moving directly towards the apple at (4, 9) is still a viable option, but I need to ensure I don't get trapped by Snake #1.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n- Move up to (5, 9) to get closer to the apple at (4, 9) while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #1.\n- From (5, 9), I can then move left to (4, 9) to eat the apple or explore other opportunities.\n\n**Next move: UP**"
