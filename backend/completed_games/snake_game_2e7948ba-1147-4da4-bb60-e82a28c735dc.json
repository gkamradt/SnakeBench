(3, 8) - unreachable in one turn.\n2. (7, 7) - quite far and involves multiple moves.\n3. (8, 2) - also distant, no immediate moves toward it.\n4. **(5, 5)** - moving towards (4, 5) would lead to this apple in the next turn, but I'm aware of the enemy snake below.\n5. **(2, 4)** - directly to my left, which is accessible this turn.\n\n### Immediate Consideration\n1. Moving LEFT to (2, 4) allows me to collect an apple.\n2. Moving UP to (4, 5) would set up collecting the apple at (5, 5) next turn but is risky because of the enemy snake.\n\n### Risks\n- If I move to the left (2, 4), I'll collect the apple and stay safe.\n- If I move up (to 4, 5), I can aim for the apple at (5, 5), but there\u2019s a significant risk of colliding with the enemy snake right after.\n\nGiven that my primary goal is to collect apples and avoid danger, and that I can safely collect one at (2, 4) without risking a collision, it clearly makes sense to choose the left direction.\n\n### Conclusion\nGoing LEFT will ensure I gain one point from the apple and keeps me safe from running into walls, enemies, or myself. \n\nNext Move: **LEFT**"
