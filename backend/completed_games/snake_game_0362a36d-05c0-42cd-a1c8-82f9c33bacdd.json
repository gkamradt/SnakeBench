Reviewing the positions of the apples:\n- The nearest apple is located at (0, 5) directly to the left and then up. It's advantageous to aim for this apple first since it's closest.\n- There are no other snakes or parts of my snake immediately in the four surrounding cells, making it safe to move in any direction.\n\nThe enemy snake #2 at (0, 2) isn't an immediate threat as it has no body segments, but its presence near the apple at (0, 5) might be a concern if it decides to head north on its next move. Therefore, securing the apple at (0, 5) quickly is essential.\n\nStrategically:\nSince the aforementioned apple is one space left and two spaces up from my current position, the most straightforward and safe route would be to move left to (0, 3) first and then proceed upwards in the following turns. This avoids wasting moves and gets the apple fastest provided the enemy doesn't make the exact move upwards next. \n\nGiven the rules and the need to continually gain points, the plan for the next few moves would be to head towards (0, 5) to eat the apple and then potentially move towards the next nearest apple depending on the evolving situation.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**\nThis choice ensures I progress towards the nearest apple while avoiding any unnecessary risk."

I notice that there's an apple at (0, 5) which is relatively close to my current position. I'd like to move up to get closer to it.\n\nStrategy: I'll try to move up and see if I can get closer to the apple at (0, 5). If I can get close enough, I might be able to grab it and grow.\n\nNext move: UP"
