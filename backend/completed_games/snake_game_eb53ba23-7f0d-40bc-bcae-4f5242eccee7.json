            "rationale": "### Current Position\n- I am currently positioned at **(6, 3)**.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n- I am moving away from Snake #2, now at (4, 2).\n- Apples nearby are at positions (2, 7), (7, 6), and (2, 4).\n  \n### Potential Moves\n- **UP to (6, 4):** Moves me towards the apple at (7, 6) and keeps a safe distance from Snake #2. This is a strategic move to access the apple at (7, 6) in future moves.\n- **DOWN to (6, 2):** Moves me closer to Snake #2, which could lead to a risky confrontation. It doesn't line up directly with any apples, making it a less favorable move.\n- **LEFT to (5, 3):** Continues to keep distance from Snake #2, but it doesn't immediately lead me towards any apples.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Returns to a previously occupied position, remaining stagnant in progress toward apples.\n\n### Strategy Considerations\n- **Apple Priority:** The apple at (7, 6) is our closest target.\n- **Safety First:** Avoid paths that bring us too close to Snake #2.\n- **Responsive Movement:** Monitor Snake #2 and adjust positioning to remain advantageous and out of confrontation.\n\n### Decision\n- **Move UP to (6, 4):**\n  - Moves towards the appetizing apple at (7, 6).\n  - Maintains a safe distance from the threat posed by Snake #2.\n  - Positions me to pivot towards other apples in the future if necessary.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n- Monitor Snake #2's movement in response to my positioning.\n- Consider continuing towards the apple at (7, 6) or adjust based on openings or threats.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP"
