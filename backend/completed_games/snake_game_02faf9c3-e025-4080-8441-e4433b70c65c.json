Since the last move was UP, and the snake is currently at (1, 7), moving UP again will bring the snake to (1, 6), which is one step closer to the apple.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided information. The text states that the snake is currently at (1, 7), but the board state shows the snake at (1, 6). Assuming the board state is correct, the next move should be UP to position the snake at (1, 5).\n\nBefore making the next move, let's re-evaluate the board:\n\n- The enemy snake #2 is at (6, 3), not (6, 2) as mentioned in the rationale. This means the enemy snake is diagonally one step away from the apple at (7, 3).\n- The apples at (7, 3) and (2, 4) are not in the direct path of the snake and are less strategically valuable at the moment compared to the apples at (4, 5) and (4, 6).\n- The apples at (5, 9) and (4, 6) are aligned vertically, which means after collecting the apple at (4, 5), the snake can move UP to align with the apple at (4, 6) and then move RIGHT to collect it without any additional moves.\n\nBased on this re-evaluation, the strategy for the next few moves remains:\n\n1. Move UP to position myself at (1, 5), one step closer to the apple at (4, 5).\n2. After collecting the apple at (4, 5), move UP again to align with the apple at (4, 6).\n3. Then move RIGHT to collect the apple at (4, 6).\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (4, 6), I will reassess the board for the next target apple and consider any movements of the enemy snake.\n\nBased on this strategy, my next move should be:\n\nUP"
