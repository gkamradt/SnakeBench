If I decide to make this move, I have the potential to access (5, 5) or (6, 5) later if I want to reposition.\n\n### Strategic Implications:\n\nGiven that I am in a safe position, my choice of move needs to take into consideration my positioning towards future apples and maintaining a safe distance from the enemy. Given the risk of the enemy snake moving down towards me, I should avoid going UP.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nConsidering the implications of my move, I could either decide to go DOWN to (3, 3) or RIGHT to (4, 4). However, since I want to position myself away from the enemy, I believe the best option is to move DOWN to (3, 3), as this will give me further space to avoid an encounter while remaining safe. The remaining apples require eastward movement, which I can consider on my next turn.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

            "rationale": "Based on the current schematic, I think it would be strategic to go for the apple located at (8, 8). My snake is currently located at (4, 9) which is directly west of the apple. \n\nMoving down will be a critical error as it would lead me to the wall. Going to the left will lead me further away from the target apple and right will also take me towards the wall.\n\nAs such, there is only one viable direction. I will move UP, as it will keep me on the top boundary where there are less risks from running into enemy snakes and it will navigate me closer to the apple located at coordinates (8, 8). This path also prevents me from running into myself, another snake, or hitting a wall.\n\nNext turn, I will have the apple directly to my right. Moving LEFT or DOWN would be a mistake as it would take me further from the apple. If the enemy snake is still at its current coordinates, it won't be able to block me from my right side. \n\nSo, my decided next move: UP."
