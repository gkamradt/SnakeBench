            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,5) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 5: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: A . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should choose the one that's closest and safest to get to.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (0,0):\n\nDistance = |7-0| + |9-0| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\n2. (2,0):\n\nDistance = |7-2| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n\n3. (4,1):\n\nDistance = |7-4| + |9-1| = 3 + 8 = 11\n\n4. (3,3):\n\nDistance = |7-3| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. (9,6):\n\nDistance = |7-9| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet's see if that's a safe path.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (9,6):\n\nTo get from x=7 to x=9, I need to move right twice.\n\nTo get from y=9 to y=6, I need to move down three times.\n\nSo, possible path: down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,9):\n\nDown to (7,8): empty\n\nDown to (7,7): empty\n\nDown to (7,6): empty\n\nRight to (8,6): empty\n\nRight to (9,6): apple\n\nLooks clear.\n\nBut I need to check if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5), which is quite far from my path to (9,6). Also, its body is empty, so it's just the head at (2,5).\n\nSo, it's unlikely to cross paths with me.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (9,6), I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,6).\n\nThe next closest apple might be (3,3), which is distance |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWait, (0,0) is |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(2,0) is |9-2| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next closest.\n\nBut let's see the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\nNeed to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nThat is, left, left, left, left, left, left, up, up, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after growing from eating (9,6), my tail will be at (7,6), assuming I move right from (7,6) to (8,6), then (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, let's simulate it.\n\nCurrent position: (7,9)\n\nMove down to (7,8)\n\nMove down to (7,7)\n\nMove down to (7,6)\n\nMove right to (8,6)\n\nMove right to (9,6) and eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I have a tail segment at (8,6).\n\nNow, from (9,6), I want to go to (3,3).\n\nTo get to (3,3), I need to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nSo, left to (8,6) - but (8,6) is my tail, which is now part of my body.\n\nWait, no. After moving to (9,6), my tail is at (8,6).\n\nSo, if I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), but (8,6) is now occupied by my tail, so I can't move there.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you move, your tail moves away by one segment.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, every part of the snake moves one step in the chosen direction, and the tail moves out accordingly.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a turn-based game, and you choose a direction, then the entire snake moves in that direction by one step.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the movement mechanics.\n\nAssuming that when you move, your head moves in the chosen direction, and the rest of the body follows, with the tail moving out accordingly.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,9) down to (7,8), then (7,9) is now occupied by the body, and so on.\n\nBut in this simple case, where I'm just moving step by step, and the snake is initially just the head, I need to consider that after eating the apple, the snake grows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (9,6), the snake will have an additional segment.\n\nTherefore, when planning the path, I need to account for the growing length.\n\nThis complicates things, as I need to ensure that the path doesn't lead to the snake colliding with its own tail.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that requires the shortest path without considering the growth, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nBut that might not be the best strategy in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that is closest and in a direction that allows me to escape or have more space.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (9,6) is at the top-right, which gives me some space to grow towards the right and up.\n\nWhereas the apples at lower left are closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5), which is in the middle-left area.\n\nSo, by going to (9,6), I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is safer.\n\nAlso, the apples at (0,0), (2,0), and (4,1) are all in the bottom-left area, which is where the enemy snake is.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for (9,6) first to secure that area.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), I can plan to move towards (3,3) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, moving from (9,6) to (3,3) would require moving left 6 and up 3, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't collide with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move diagonally, but in this game, movement is only in the four cardinal directions.\n\nWait, actually, in standard snake games, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nNo diagonal movement.\n\nSo, I need to plan a path that avoids my own body and the walls.\n\nPerhaps I should consider using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or DFS to find the shortest path to the apple while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut since this is a small grid, I can try to plan manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just move towards the closest apple and adjust as I go.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get trapped"

To (9,6): |8-9| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 4. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (8,9) to (9,6):\n\n- Right to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nThat's only three moves: right, down, down.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), and I'm at (8,9). So, right to (9,9), then down three times to (9,6). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut looking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n...\n\nSo, from (8,9), down to (8,8), then (8,7), (8,6), then right to (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, I'm at (8,9), and I need to get to (9,6).\n\nSo, right to (9,9), then down to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). That seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board, between (8,9) and (9,6), there don't seem to be any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (9,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan for that. I should make sure that after eating the apple, I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself.\n\nLet me think about what happens after I eat (9,6). My snake will extend, so I'll have an extra segment.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple. Let's see:\n\nFrom (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nThe other apples are farther away.\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next best target.\n\nNow, planning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left 6 times to (3,6)\n\n- Down 3 times to (3,3)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, I need to make sure that as I move left towards (3,6), I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming that the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, since the board is 10x10, and I'm moving from (9,6) to (3,3), I have enough space to maneuver without hitting walls.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is in the lower left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the enemy snake won't immediately pose a threat.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut before I proceed, I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps go for (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (2,4). If I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, that should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a distance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAgain, simple.\n\nFinally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nEasy.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail along the way.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (2,4), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, I should be safe for now.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses, the enemy snake might move towards me, so I need to stay vigilant.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows, I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nTo minimize that risk, I should try to move in a consistent direction as much as possible.\n\nIn this case, moving right and down initially, then left and down, and so on.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy snake growing and blocking my path, but for now, I'll focus on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the enemy snake is moving towards the apples in the lower left area, I might want to secure the apples in the upper right area first.\n\nGiven that, going for (9,6) first makes sense, as it's away from the enemy and closer to my current position compared to some other apples.\n\nAlright, so back to my immediate decision: where to move next?\n\nI'm at (8,9), and I want to go to (9,6).\n\nTo get from (8,9) to (9,6), I can:\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Then down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, is there any reason to not do that?\n\nLet me check if moving right is safe.\n\nAt (9,9), there doesn't seem to be any snake or wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,9) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving down to (9,8), (9,7), and (9,6).\n\nOnce I reach (9,6), I can eat the apple and grow.\n\nThen,"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,5) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 5: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: A . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should choose the one that's closest and safest to get to.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (0,0):\n\nDistance = |7-0| + |9-0| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\n2. (2,0):\n\nDistance = |7-2| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n\n3. (4,1):\n\nDistance = |7-4| + |9-1| = 3 + 8 = 11\n\n4. (3,3):\n\nDistance = |7-3| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. (9,6):\n\nDistance = |7-9| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet's see if that's a safe path.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (9,6):\n\nTo get from x=7 to x=9, I need to move right twice.\n\nTo get from y=9 to y=6, I need to move down three times.\n\nSo, possible path: down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,9):\n\nDown to (7,8): empty\n\nDown to (7,7): empty\n\nDown to (7,6): empty\n\nRight to (8,6): empty\n\nRight to (9,6): apple\n\nLooks clear.\n\nBut I need to check if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5), which is quite far from my path to (9,6). Also, its body is empty, so it's just the head at (2,5).\n\nSo, it's unlikely to cross paths with me.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (9,6), I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,6).\n\nThe next closest apple might be (3,3), which is distance |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWait, (0,0) is |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(2,0) is |9-2| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next closest.\n\nBut let's see the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\nNeed to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nThat is, left, left, left, left, left, left, up, up, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after growing from eating (9,6), my tail will be at (7,6), assuming I move right from (7,6) to (8,6), then (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, let's simulate it.\n\nCurrent position: (7,9)\n\nMove down to (7,8)\n\nMove down to (7,7)\n\nMove down to (7,6)\n\nMove right to (8,6)\n\nMove right to (9,6) and eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I have a tail segment at (8,6).\n\nNow, from (9,6), I want to go to (3,3).\n\nTo get to (3,3), I need to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nSo, left to (8,6) - but (8,6) is my tail, which is now part of my body.\n\nWait, no. After moving to (9,6), my tail is at (8,6).\n\nSo, if I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), but (8,6) is now occupied by my tail, so I can't move there.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you move, your tail moves away by one segment.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, every part of the snake moves one step in the chosen direction, and the tail moves out accordingly.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a turn-based game, and you choose a direction, then the entire snake moves in that direction by one step.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the movement mechanics.\n\nAssuming that when you move, your head moves in the chosen direction, and the rest of the body follows, with the tail moving out accordingly.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,9) down to (7,8), then (7,9) is now occupied by the body, and so on.\n\nBut in this simple case, where I'm just moving step by step, and the snake is initially just the head, I need to consider that after eating the apple, the snake grows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (9,6), the snake will have an additional segment.\n\nTherefore, when planning the path, I need to account for the growing length.\n\nThis complicates things, as I need to ensure that the path doesn't lead to the snake colliding with its own tail.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that requires the shortest path without considering the growth, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nBut that might not be the best strategy in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that is closest and in a direction that allows me to escape or have more space.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (9,6) is at the top-right, which gives me some space to grow towards the right and up.\n\nWhereas the apples at lower left are closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5), which is in the middle-left area.\n\nSo, by going to (9,6), I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is safer.\n\nAlso, the apples at (0,0), (2,0), and (4,1) are all in the bottom-left area, which is where the enemy snake is.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for (9,6) first to secure that area.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), I can plan to move towards (3,3) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, moving from (9,6) to (3,3) would require moving left 6 and up 3, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't collide with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move diagonally, but in this game, movement is only in the four cardinal directions.\n\nWait, actually, in standard snake games, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nNo diagonal movement.\n\nSo, I need to plan a path that avoids my own body and the walls.\n\nPerhaps I should consider using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or DFS to find the shortest path to the apple while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut since this is a small grid, I can try to plan manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just move towards the closest apple and adjust as I go.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get trapped"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, my snake is at position (8,8), which is towards the top-right of the board. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at the top-right. That means higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nThere are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). So, multiple targets to aim for.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (1,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nMy main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince there are multiple apples, I need to decide which one to go for first. I should probably go for the closest one that's safe to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position (8,8) to each apple using Manhattan distance, since we can't move diagonally.\n\n1. To (0,0): |8-0| + |8-0| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\n2. To (2,0): |8-2| + |8-0| = 6 + 8 = 14\n\n3. To (4,1): |8-4| + |8-1| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\n4. To (3,3): |8-3| + |8-3| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n5. To (9,6): |8-9| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 3. That seems like the best target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (8,8) to (9,6):\n\n- Right to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nThat's just two moves: right, then down, down.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board, between (8,8) and (9,6), there don't seem to be any snakes or walls.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (1,4), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (9,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan for that. I should make sure that after eating the apple, I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself.\n\nLet me think about what happens after I eat (9,6). My snake will extend, so I'll have an extra segment.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple. From (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nSo, (3,3) is closer.\n\nPlanning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\n- Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, as I move left towards (3,6), I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, the board is 10x10, so there's enough space to maneuver.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (1,4), which is in the lower-left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume it's safe.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems okay.\n\nBut I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (1,4), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, so that should be safe for now.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nDistance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAnd finally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to be cautious about the enemy snake's movements and make sure I don't run into it or my own tail.\n\nGiven that, I should proceed with my initial plan.\n\nNow, focusing on my immediate move: I'm at (8,8), and I need to move right to (9,8) to start heading towards (9,6).\n\nBefore I do that, I should check if moving right is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (9,8) is empty, and there are no snakes there.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,8) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, I can move down to (9,7), then to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\nOnce I eat the apple, I'll grow, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't lead me into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, moving right to (9,8) is the way to go.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving right seems like the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,5) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . .

A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should choose the one that's closest and safest to get to.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (0,0):\n\nDistance = |7-0| + |9-0| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\n2. (2,0):\n\nDistance = |7-2| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n\n3. (4,1):\n\nDistance = |7-4| + |9-1| = 3 + 8 = 11\n\n4. (3,3):\n\nDistance = |7-3| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. (9,6):\n\nDistance = |7-9| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet's see if that's a safe path.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (9,6):\n\nTo get from x=7 to x=9, I need to move right twice.\n\nTo get from y=9 to y=6, I need to move down three times.\n\nSo, possible path: down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,9):\n\nDown to (7,8): empty\n\nDown to (7,7): empty\n\nDown to (7,6): empty\n\nRight to (8,6): empty\n\nRight to (9,6): apple\n\nLooks clear.\n\nBut I need to check if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5), which is quite far from my path to (9,6). Also, its body is empty, so it's just the head at (2,5).\n\nSo, it's unlikely to cross paths with me.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (9,6), I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,6).\n\nThe next closest apple might be (3,3), which is distance |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWait, (0,0) is |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(2,0) is |9-2| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next closest.\n\nBut let's see the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\nNeed to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nThat is, left, left, left, left, left, left, up, up, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after growing from eating (9,6), my tail will be at (7,6), assuming I move right from (7,6) to (8,6), then (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, let's simulate it.\n\nCurrent position: (7,9)\n\nMove down to (7,8)\n\nMove down to (7,7)\n\nMove down to (7,6)\n\nMove right to (8,6)\n\nMove right to (9,6) and eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I have a tail segment at (8,6).\n\nNow, from (9,6), I want to go to (3,3).\n\nTo get to (3,3), I need to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nSo, left to (8,6) - but (8,6) is my tail, which is now part of my body.\n\nWait, no. After moving to (9,6), my tail is at (8,6).\n\nSo, if I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), but (8,6) is now occupied by my tail, so I can't move there.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you move, your tail moves away by one segment.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, every part of the snake moves one step in the chosen direction, and the tail moves out accordingly.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a turn-based game, and you choose a direction, then the entire snake moves in that direction by one step.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the movement mechanics.\n\nAssuming that when you move, your head moves in the chosen direction, and the rest of the body follows, with the tail moving out accordingly.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,9) down to (7,8), then (7,9) is now occupied by the body, and so on.\n\nBut in this simple case, where I'm just moving step by step, and the snake is initially just the head, I need to consider that after eating the apple, the snake grows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (9,6), the snake will have an additional segment.\n\nTherefore, when planning the path, I need to account for the growing length.\n\nThis complicates things, as I need to ensure that the path doesn't lead to the snake colliding with its own tail.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that requires the shortest path without considering the growth, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nBut that might not be the best strategy in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that is closest and in a direction that allows me to escape or have more space.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (9,6) is at the top-right, which gives me some space to grow towards the right and up.\n\nWhereas the apples at lower left are closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5), which is in the middle-left area.\n\nSo, by going to (9,6), I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is safer.\n\nAlso, the apples at (0,0), (2,0), and (4,1) are all in the bottom-left area, which is where the enemy snake is.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for (9,6) first to secure that area.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), I can plan to move towards (3,3) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, moving from (9,6) to (3,3) would require moving left 6 and up 3, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't collide with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move diagonally, but in this game, movement is only in the four cardinal directions.\n\nWait, actually, in standard snake games, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nNo diagonal movement.\n\nSo, I need to plan a path that avoids my own body and the walls.\n\nPerhaps I should consider using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or DFS to find the shortest path to the apple while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut since this is a small grid, I can try to plan manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just move towards the closest apple and adjust as I go.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get trapped"

Let's see:\n\nFrom (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nThe other apples are farther away.\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next best target.\n\nNow, planning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left 6 times to (3,6)\n\n- Down 3 times to (3,3)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, I need to make sure that as I move left towards (3,6), I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming that the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, since the board is 10x10, and I'm moving from (9,6) to (3,3), I have enough space to maneuver without hitting walls.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is in the lower left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the enemy snake won't immediately pose a threat.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1.

After that, perhaps go for (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (2,4). If I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, that should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a distance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAgain, simple.\n\nFinally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nEasy.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail along the way.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (2,4), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, I should be safe for now.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses, the enemy snake might move towards me, so I need to stay vigilant.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows, I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nTo minimize that risk, I should try to move in a consistent direction as much as possible.\n\nIn this case, moving right and down initially, then left and down, and so on.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy snake growing and blocking my path, but for now, I'll focus on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the enemy snake is moving towards the apples in the lower left area, I might want to secure the apples in the upper right area first.\n\nGiven that, going for (9,6) first makes sense, as it's away from the enemy and closer to my current position compared to some other apples.\n\nAlright, so back to my immediate decision: where to move next?\n\nI'm at (8,9), and I want to go to (9,6).\n\nTo get from (8,9) to (9,6), I can:\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Then down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, is there any reason to not do that?\n\nLet me check if moving right is safe.\n\nAt (9,9), there doesn't seem to be any snake or wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,9) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving down to (9,8), (9,7), and (9,6).\n\nOnce I reach (9,6), I can eat the apple and grow.\n\nThen,"

There are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,5) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . .

A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should choose the one that's closest and safest to get to.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (0,0):\n\nDistance = |7-0| + |9-0| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\n2. (2,0):\n\nDistance = |7-2| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n\n3. (4,1):\n\nDistance = |7-4| + |9-1| = 3 + 8 = 11\n\n4. (3,3):\n\nDistance = |7-3| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. (9,6):\n\nDistance = |7-9| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet's see if that's a safe path.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (9,6):\n\nTo get from x=7 to x=9, I need to move right twice.\n\nTo get from y=9 to y=6, I need to move down three times.\n\nSo, possible path: down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,9):\n\nDown to (7,8): empty\n\nDown to (7,7): empty\n\nDown to (7,6): empty\n\nRight to (8,6): empty\n\nRight to (9,6): apple\n\nLooks clear.\n\nBut I need to check if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5), which is quite far from my path to (9,6). Also, its body is empty, so it's just the head at (2,5).\n\nSo, it's unlikely to cross paths with me.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (9,6), I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,6).\n\nThe next closest apple might be (3,3), which is distance |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWait, (0,0) is |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(2,0) is |9-2| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next closest.\n\nBut let's see the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\nNeed to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nThat is, left, left, left, left, left, left, up, up, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after growing from eating (9,6), my tail will be at (7,6), assuming I move right from (7,6) to (8,6), then (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, let's simulate it.\n\nCurrent position: (7,9)\n\nMove down to (7,8)\n\nMove down to (7,7)\n\nMove down to (7,6)\n\nMove right to (8,6)\n\nMove right to (9,6) and eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I have a tail segment at (8,6).\n\nNow, from (9,6), I want to go to (3,3).\n\nTo get to (3,3), I need to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nSo, left to (8,6) - but (8,6) is my tail, which is now part of my body.\n\nWait, no. After moving to (9,6), my tail is at (8,6).\n\nSo, if I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), but (8,6) is now occupied by my tail, so I can't move there.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you move, your tail moves away by one segment.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, every part of the snake moves one step in the chosen direction, and the tail moves out accordingly.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a turn-based game, and you choose a direction, then the entire snake moves in that direction by one step.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the movement mechanics.\n\nAssuming that when you move, your head moves in the chosen direction, and the rest of the body follows, with the tail moving out accordingly.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,9) down to (7,8), then (7,9) is now occupied by the body, and so on.\n\nBut in this simple case, where I'm just moving step by step, and the snake is initially just the head, I need to consider that after eating the apple, the snake grows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (9,6), the snake will have an additional segment.\n\nTherefore, when planning the path, I need to account for the growing length.\n\nThis complicates things, as I need to ensure that the path doesn't lead to the snake colliding with its own tail.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that requires the shortest path without considering the growth, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nBut that might not be the best strategy in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that is closest and in a direction that allows me to escape or have more space.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (9,6) is at the top-right, which gives me some space to grow towards the right and up.\n\nWhereas the apples at lower left are closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5), which is in the middle-left area.\n\nSo, by going to (9,6), I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is safer.\n\nAlso, the apples at (0,0), (2,0), and (4,1) are all in the bottom-left area, which is where the enemy snake is.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for (9,6) first to secure that area.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), I can plan to move towards (3,3) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, moving from (9,6) to (3,3) would require moving left 6 and up 3, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't collide with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move diagonally, but in this game, movement is only in the four cardinal directions.\n\nWait, actually, in standard snake games, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nNo diagonal movement.\n\nSo, I need to plan a path that avoids my own body and the walls.\n\nPerhaps I should consider using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or DFS to find the shortest path to the apple while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut since this is a small grid, I can try to plan manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just move towards the closest apple and adjust as I go.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get trapped"

So, multiple targets to aim for.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (2,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose between moving up, down, left, or right, and I have to make sure not to hit walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should probably go for the closest one that's safe to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position (8,9) to each apple using Manhattan distance, since diagonal moves aren't allowed.\n\n1. To (0,0): |8-0| + |9-0| = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n2. To (2,0): |8-2| + |9-0| = 6 + 9 = 15\n\n3. To (4,1): |8-4| + |9-1| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\n4. To (3,3): |8-3| + |9-3| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n5. To (9,6): |8-9| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 4. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (8,9) to (9,6):\n\n- Right to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nThat's only three moves: right, down, down.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), and I'm at (8,9). So, right to (9,9), then down three times to (9,6). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut looking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n...\n\nSo, from (8,9), down to (8,8), then (8,7), (8,6), then right to (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, I'm at (8,9), and I need to get to (9,6).\n\nSo, right to (9,9), then down to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). That seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board, between (8,9) and (9,6), there don't seem to be any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (9,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan for that. I should make sure that after eating the apple, I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself.\n\nLet me think about what happens after I eat (9,6). My snake will extend, so I'll have an extra segment.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple. Let's see:\n\nFrom (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nThe other apples are farther away.\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next best target.\n\nNow, planning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left 6 times to (3,6)\n\n- Down 3 times to (3,3)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, I need to make sure that as I move left towards (3,6), I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming that the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, since the board is 10x10, and I'm moving from (9,6) to (3,3), I have enough space to maneuver without hitting walls.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is in the lower left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the enemy snake won't immediately pose a threat.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut before I proceed, I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps go for (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (2,4). If I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, that should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a distance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAgain, simple.\n\nFinally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nEasy.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail along the way.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (2,4), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, I should be safe for now.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses, the enemy snake might move towards me, so I need to stay vigilant.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows, I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nTo minimize that risk, I should try to move in a consistent direction as much as possible.\n\nIn this case, moving right and down initially, then left and down, and so on.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy snake growing and blocking my path, but for now, I'll focus on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the enemy snake is moving towards the apples in the lower left area, I might want to secure the apples in the upper right area first.\n\nGiven that, going for (9,6) first makes sense, as it's away from the enemy and closer to my current position compared to some other apples.\n\nAlright, so back to my immediate decision: where to move next?\n\nI'm at (8,9), and I want to go to (9,6).\n\nTo get from (8,9) to (9,6), I can:\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Then down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, is there any reason to not do that?\n\nLet me check if moving right is safe.\n\nAt (9,9), there doesn't seem to be any snake or wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,9) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving down to (9,8), (9,7), and (9,6).\n\nOnce I reach (9,6), I can eat the apple and grow.\n\nThen,"

So, as I move left towards (3,6), I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, the board is 10x10, so there's enough space to maneuver.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is in the lower-left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume it's safe.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems okay.\n\nBut I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,3), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, so that should be safe for now.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nDistance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAnd finally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to be cautious about the enemy snake's movements and make sure I don't run into it or my own tail.\n\nGiven that, I should proceed with my initial plan.\n\nNow, focusing on my immediate move: I'm at (9,7), and I need to move down to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBefore I do that, I should check if moving down is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (9,6) is occupied by an apple, so moving there will make me eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a wall, another snake, or my own tail.\n\nFrom (9,6), I plan to move left to (8,6). Let's see:\n\n- (8,6) is empty, according to the board.\n\n- Then to (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\nAll these positions seem empty.\n\nThen down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3).\n\nAgain, these positions are empty.\n\nSo, it should be safe.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving down to (9,6) to eat the apple seems like the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n\n1.

There are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,5) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 5: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: A . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should choose the one that's closest and safest to get to.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (0,0):\n\nDistance = |7-0| + |9-0| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\n2. (2,0):\n\nDistance = |7-2| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n\n3. (4,1):\n\nDistance = |7-4| + |9-1| = 3 + 8 = 11\n\n4. (3,3):\n\nDistance = |7-3| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. (9,6):\n\nDistance = |7-9| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet's see if that's a safe path.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (9,6):\n\nTo get from x=7 to x=9, I need to move right twice.\n\nTo get from y=9 to y=6, I need to move down three times.\n\nSo, possible path: down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,9):\n\nDown to (7,8): empty\n\nDown to (7,7): empty\n\nDown to (7,6): empty\n\nRight to (8,6): empty\n\nRight to (9,6): apple\n\nLooks clear.\n\nBut I need to check if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5), which is quite far from my path to (9,6). Also, its body is empty, so it's just the head at (2,5).\n\nSo, it's unlikely to cross paths with me.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (9,6), I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,6).\n\nThe next closest apple might be (3,3), which is distance |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWait, (0,0) is |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(2,0) is |9-2| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next closest.\n\nBut let's see the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\nNeed to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nThat is, left, left, left, left, left, left, up, up, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after growing from eating (9,6), my tail will be at (7,6), assuming I move right from (7,6) to (8,6), then (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, let's simulate it.\n\nCurrent position: (7,9)\n\nMove down to (7,8)\n\nMove down to (7,7)\n\nMove down to (7,6)\n\nMove right to (8,6)\n\nMove right to (9,6) and eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I have a tail segment at (8,6).\n\nNow, from (9,6), I want to go to (3,3).\n\nTo get to (3,3), I need to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nSo, left to (8,6) - but (8,6) is my tail, which is now part of my body.\n\nWait, no. After moving to (9,6), my tail is at (8,6).\n\nSo, if I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), but (8,6) is now occupied by my tail, so I can't move there.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you move, your tail moves away by one segment.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, every part of the snake moves one step in the chosen direction, and the tail moves out accordingly.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a turn-based game, and you choose a direction, then the entire snake moves in that direction by one step.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the movement mechanics.\n\nAssuming that when you move, your head moves in the chosen direction, and the rest of the body follows, with the tail moving out accordingly.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,9) down to (7,8), then (7,9) is now occupied by the body, and so on.\n\nBut in this simple case, where I'm just moving step by step, and the snake is initially just the head, I need to consider that after eating the apple, the snake grows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (9,6), the snake will have an additional segment.\n\nTherefore, when planning the path, I need to account for the growing length.\n\nThis complicates things, as I need to ensure that the path doesn't lead to the snake colliding with its own tail.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that requires the shortest path without considering the growth, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nBut that might not be the best strategy in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that is closest and in a direction that allows me to escape or have more space.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (9,6) is at the top-right, which gives me some space to grow towards the right and up.\n\nWhereas the apples at lower left are closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5), which is in the middle-left area.\n\nSo, by going to (9,6), I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is safer.\n\nAlso, the apples at (0,0), (2,0), and (4,1) are all in the bottom-left area, which is where the enemy snake is.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for (9,6) first to secure that area.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), I can plan to move towards (3,3) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, moving from (9,6) to (3,3) would require moving left 6 and up 3, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't collide with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move diagonally, but in this game, movement is only in the four cardinal directions.\n\nWait, actually, in standard snake games, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nNo diagonal movement.\n\nSo, I need to plan a path that avoids my own body and the walls.\n\nPerhaps I should consider using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or DFS to find the shortest path to the apple while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut since this is a small grid, I can try to plan manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just move towards the closest apple and adjust as I go.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get trapped"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (8,9), which is on the top row, second from the right. The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right.\n\nThere are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0).

I should probably go for the closest one that's safe to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position (8,9) to each apple using Manhattan distance, since diagonal moves aren't allowed.\n\n1. To (0,0): |8-0| + |9-0| = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n2. To (2,0): |8-2| + |9-0| = 6 + 9 = 15\n\n3. To (4,1): |8-4| + |9-1| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\n4. To (3,3): |8-3| + |9-3| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n5. To (9,6): |8-9| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 4. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (8,9) to (9,6):\n\n- Right to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nThat's only three moves: right, down, down.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), and I'm at (8,9). So, right to (9,9), then down three times to (9,6). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut looking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n...\n\nSo, from (8,9), down to (8,8), then (8,7), (8,6), then right to (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, I'm at (8,9), and I need to get to (9,6).\n\nSo, right to (9,9), then down to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). That seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board, between (8,9) and (9,6), there don't seem to be any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (9,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan for that. I should make sure that after eating the apple, I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself.\n\nLet me think about what happens after I eat (9,6). My snake will extend, so I'll have an extra segment.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple. Let's see:\n\nFrom (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nThe other apples are farther away.\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next best target.\n\nNow, planning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left 6 times to (3,6)\n\n- Down 3 times to (3,3)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, I need to make sure that as I move left towards (3,6), I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming that the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, since the board is 10x10, and I'm moving from (9,6) to (3,3), I have enough space to maneuver without hitting walls.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is in the lower left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the enemy snake won't immediately pose a threat.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut before I proceed, I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps go for (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (2,4). If I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, that should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a distance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAgain, simple.\n\nFinally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nEasy.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail along the way.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (2,4), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, I should be safe for now.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses, the enemy snake might move towards me, so I need to stay vigilant.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows, I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nTo minimize that risk, I should try to move in a consistent direction as much as possible.\n\nIn this case, moving right and down initially, then left and down, and so on.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy snake growing and blocking my path, but for now, I'll focus on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the enemy snake is moving towards the apples in the lower left area, I might want to secure the apples in the upper right area first.\n\nGiven that, going for (9,6) first makes sense, as it's away from the enemy and closer to my current position compared to some other apples.\n\nAlright, so back to my immediate decision: where to move next?\n\nI'm at (8,9), and I want to go to (9,6).\n\nTo get from (8,9) to (9,6), I can:\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Then down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, is there any reason to not do that?\n\nLet me check if moving right is safe.\n\nAt (9,9), there doesn't seem to be any snake or wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,9) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving down to (9,8), (9,7), and (9,6).\n\nOnce I reach (9,6), I can eat the apple and grow.\n\nThen,"

So, multiple targets to aim for.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (1,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nMy main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince there are multiple apples, I need to decide which one to go for first. I should probably go for the closest one that's safe to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position (8,8) to each apple using Manhattan distance, since we can't move diagonally.\n\n1. To (0,0): |8-0| + |8-0| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\n2. To (2,0): |8-2| + |8-0| = 6 + 8 = 14\n\n3. To (4,1): |8-4| + |8-1| = 4 + 7 = 11\n\n4. To (3,3): |8-3| + |8-3| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n5. To (9,6): |8-9| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 3. That seems like the best target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (8,8) to (9,6):\n\n- Right to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nThat's just two moves: right, then down, down.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board, between (8,8) and (9,6), there don't seem to be any snakes or walls.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (1,4), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (9,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan for that. I should make sure that after eating the apple, I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself.\n\nLet me think about what happens after I eat (9,6). My snake will extend, so I'll have an extra segment.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple. From (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nSo, (3,3) is closer.\n\nPlanning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\n- Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, as I move left towards (3,6), I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, the board is 10x10, so there's enough space to maneuver.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (1,4), which is in the lower-left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume it's safe.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems okay.\n\nBut I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (1,4), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, so that should be safe for now.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nDistance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAnd finally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to be cautious about the enemy snake's movements and make sure I don't run into it or my own tail.\n\nGiven that, I should proceed with my initial plan.\n\nNow, focusing on my immediate move: I'm at (8,8), and I need to move right to (9,8) to start heading towards (9,6).\n\nBefore I do that, I should check if moving right is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (9,8) is empty, and there are no snakes there.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,8) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, I can move down to (9,7), then to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\nOnce I eat the apple, I'll grow, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't lead me into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, moving right to (9,8) is the way to go.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving right seems like the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

I need to continue moving in a direction that avoids my own body.\n\nAssuming I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), then (7,6), and so on, as long as I keep moving in a straight line, I should be fine.\n\nBut I should be prepared to adjust my path if the enemy snake moves towards me or if I need to avoid my own tail.\n\nLooking ahead, after reaching (3,6), I'll need to move down to (3,5), (3,4), and then (3,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (3,3), the next closest apple is at (4,1), with a distance of |3-4| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, from (3,3), I can move right to (4,3), then down to (4,2), and then down to (4,1).\n\nAfter eating (4,1), the next apple is at (2,0), which is |4-2| + |1-0| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move left to (3,1), left to (2,1), and then down to (2,0).\n\nFinally, from (2,0), the last apple is at (0,0), which is |2-0| + |0-0| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nSo, from (2,0), I can move left to (1,0), and then left to (0,0).\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan, but I need to remain flexible in case the enemy snake poses a threat or if I need to adjust my path due to my growing length.\n\nGiven all that, my immediate move should be to move down to (8,6) to set myself up to eat the apple at (9,6) next.\n\nWait a minute, actually, from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) and then right to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving down to (8,6) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,6) seems to be empty, and (9,6) has an apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), I'll grow, and then I can move left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., as planned.\n\nSo, for this turn, moving down to (8,6) is the way to go.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n\n1.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,5) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 5: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: A . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should choose the one that's closest and safest to get to.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (0,0):\n\nDistance = |7-0| + |9-0| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\n2. (2,0):\n\nDistance = |7-2| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n\n3. (4,1):\n\nDistance = |7-4| + |9-1| = 3 + 8 = 11\n\n4. (3,3):\n\nDistance = |7-3| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. (9,6):\n\nDistance = |7-9| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet's see if that's a safe path.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (9,6):\n\nTo get from x=7 to x=9, I need to move right twice.\n\nTo get from y=9 to y=6, I need to move down three times.\n\nSo, possible path: down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,9):\n\nDown to (7,8): empty\n\nDown to (7,7): empty\n\nDown to (7,6): empty\n\nRight to (8,6): empty\n\nRight to (9,6): apple\n\nLooks clear.\n\nBut I need to check if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5), which is quite far from my path to (9,6). Also, its body is empty, so it's just the head at (2,5).\n\nSo, it's unlikely to cross paths with me.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (9,6), I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,6).\n\nThe next closest apple might be (3,3), which is distance |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWait, (0,0) is |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(2,0) is |9-2| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next closest.\n\nBut let's see the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\nNeed to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nThat is, left, left, left, left, left, left, up, up, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after growing from eating (9,6), my tail will be at (7,6), assuming I move right from (7,6) to (8,6), then (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, let's simulate it.\n\nCurrent position: (7,9)\n\nMove down to (7,8)\n\nMove down to (7,7)\n\nMove down to (7,6)\n\nMove right to (8,6)\n\nMove right to (9,6) and eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I have a tail segment at (8,6).\n\nNow, from (9,6), I want to go to (3,3).\n\nTo get to (3,3), I need to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nSo, left to (8,6) - but (8,6) is my tail, which is now part of my body.\n\nWait, no. After moving to (9,6), my tail is at (8,6).\n\nSo, if I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), but (8,6) is now occupied by my tail, so I can't move there.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you move, your tail moves away by one segment.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, every part of the snake moves one step in the chosen direction, and the tail moves out accordingly.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a turn-based game, and you choose a direction, then the entire snake moves in that direction by one step.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the movement mechanics.\n\nAssuming that when you move, your head moves in the chosen direction, and the rest of the body follows, with the tail moving out accordingly.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,9) down to (7,8), then (7,9) is now occupied by the body, and so on.\n\nBut in this simple case, where I'm just moving step by step, and the snake is initially just the head, I need to consider that after eating the apple, the snake grows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (9,6), the snake will have an additional segment.\n\nTherefore, when planning the path, I need to account for the growing length.\n\nThis complicates things, as I need to ensure that the path doesn't lead to the snake colliding with its own tail.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that requires the shortest path without considering the growth, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nBut that might not be the best strategy in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that is closest and in a direction that allows me to escape or have more space.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (9,6) is at the top-right, which gives me some space to grow towards the right and up.\n\nWhereas the apples at lower left are closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5), which is in the middle-left area.\n\nSo, by going to (9,6), I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is safer.\n\nAlso, the apples at (0,0), (2,0), and (4,1) are all in the bottom-left area, which is where the enemy snake is.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for (9,6) first to secure that area.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), I can plan to move towards (3,3) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, moving from (9,6) to (3,3) would require moving left 6 and up 3, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't collide with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move diagonally, but in this game, movement is only in the four cardinal directions.\n\nWait, actually, in standard snake games, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nNo diagonal movement.\n\nSo, I need to plan a path that avoids my own body and the walls.\n\nPerhaps I should consider using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or DFS to find the shortest path to the apple while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut since this is a small grid, I can try to plan manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just move towards the closest apple and adjust as I go.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get trapped"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple snake game, and I need to decide my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (8,9), which is on the top row, second from the right. The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right.\n\nThere are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). So, multiple targets to aim for.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (2,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose between moving up, down, left, or right, and I have to make sure not to hit walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should probably go for the closest one that's safe to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position (8,9) to each apple using Manhattan distance, since diagonal moves aren't allowed.\n\n1. To (0,0): |8-0| + |9-0| = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n2. To (2,0): |8-2| + |9-0| = 6 + 9 = 15\n\n3. To (4,1): |8-4| + |9-1| = 4 + 8 = 12\n\n4. To (3,3): |8-3| + |9-3| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n5. To (9,6): |8-9| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 4. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (8,9) to (9,6):\n\n- Right to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nThat's only three moves: right, down, down.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), and I'm at (8,9). So, right to (9,9), then down three times to (9,6). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut looking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n...\n\nSo, from (8,9), down to (8,8), then (8,7), (8,6), then right to (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, I'm at (8,9), and I need to get to (9,6).\n\nSo, right to (9,9), then down to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). That seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board, between (8,9) and (9,6), there don't seem to be any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (9,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan for that. I should make sure that after eating the apple, I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself.\n\nLet me think about what happens after I eat (9,6). My snake will extend, so I'll have an extra segment.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple. Let's see:\n\nFrom (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nThe other apples are farther away.\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next best target.\n\nNow, planning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left 6 times to (3,6)\n\n- Down 3 times to (3,3)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, I need to make sure that as I move left towards (3,6), I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming that the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, since the board is 10x10, and I'm moving from (9,6) to (3,3), I have enough space to maneuver without hitting walls.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is in the lower left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the enemy snake won't immediately pose a threat.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut before I proceed, I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps go for (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (2,4). If I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, that should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a distance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAgain, simple.\n\nFinally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nEasy.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail along the way.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (2,4), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, I should be safe for now.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses, the enemy snake might move towards me, so I need to stay vigilant.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows, I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nTo minimize that risk, I should try to move in a consistent direction as much as possible.\n\nIn this case, moving right and down initially, then left and down, and so on.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy snake growing and blocking my path, but for now, I'll focus on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the enemy snake is moving towards the apples in the lower left area, I might want to secure the apples in the upper right area first.\n\nGiven that, going for (9,6) first makes sense, as it's away from the enemy and closer to my current position compared to some other apples.\n\nAlright, so back to my immediate decision: where to move next?\n\nI'm at (8,9), and I want to go to (9,6).\n\nTo get from (8,9) to (9,6), I can:\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Then down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, is there any reason to not do that?\n\nLet me check if moving right is safe.\n\nAt (9,9), there doesn't seem to be any snake or wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,9) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving down to (9,8), (9,7), and (9,6).\n\nOnce I reach (9,6), I can eat the apple and grow.\n\nThen,"

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince there are multiple apples, I need to decide which one to go for first.

So, moving down to (8,6) and then right to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without running into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (9,6), my snake will extend, and I'll need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nFrom (9,6), the next closest apple is at (3,3), with a distance of |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nSo, after eating (9,6), I should head towards (3,3).\n\nLet me plan the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\n- Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move left from (9,6) to (3,6), I don't run into my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (2,2), which is in the lower-left area, it shouldn't be in my way for now.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows, I need to ensure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nSo, after eating (9,6), I'll have an extra segment. I need to continue moving in a direction that avoids my own body.\n\nAssuming I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), then (7,6), and so on, as long as I keep moving in a straight line, I should be fine.\n\nBut I should be prepared to adjust my path if the enemy snake moves towards me or if I need to avoid my own tail.\n\nLooking ahead, after reaching (3,6), I'll need to move down to (3,5), (3,4), and then (3,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (3,3), the next closest apple is at (4,1), with a distance of |3-4| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, from (3,3), I can move right to (4,3), then down to (4,2), and then down to (4,1).\n\nAfter eating (4,1), the next apple is at (2,0), which is |4-2| + |1-0| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move left to (3,1), left to (2,1), and then down to (2,0).\n\nFinally, from (2,0), the last apple is at (0,0), which is |2-0| + |0-0| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nSo, from (2,0), I can move left to (1,0), and then left to (0,0).\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan, but I need to remain flexible in case the enemy snake poses a threat or if I need to adjust my path due to my growing length.\n\nGiven all that, my immediate move should be to move down to (8,6) to set myself up to eat the apple at (9,6) next.\n\nWait a minute, actually, from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) and then right to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving down to (8,6) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,6) seems to be empty, and (9,6) has an apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), I'll grow, and then I can move left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., as planned.\n\nSo, for this turn, moving down to (8,6) is the way to go.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n\n1.

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (7,9). There are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (2,5) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 5: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: A . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should choose the one that's closest and safest to get to.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,9) to each apple:\n\n1. (0,0):\n\nDistance = |7-0| + |9-0| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\n2. (2,0):\n\nDistance = |7-2| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n\n3. (4,1):\n\nDistance = |7-4| + |9-1| = 3 + 8 = 11\n\n4. (3,3):\n\nDistance = |7-3| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n5. (9,6):\n\nDistance = |7-9| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet's see if that's a safe path.\n\nFrom (7,9) to (9,6):\n\nTo get from x=7 to x=9, I need to move right twice.\n\nTo get from y=9 to y=6, I need to move down three times.\n\nSo, possible path: down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (7,9):\n\nDown to (7,8): empty\n\nDown to (7,7): empty\n\nDown to (7,6): empty\n\nRight to (8,6): empty\n\nRight to (9,6): apple\n\nLooks clear.\n\nBut I need to check if the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,5), which is quite far from my path to (9,6). Also, its body is empty, so it's just the head at (2,5).\n\nSo, it's unlikely to cross paths with me.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that after eating the apple at (9,6), I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself or the enemy.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the next apple to go for after (9,6).\n\nThe next closest apple might be (3,3), which is distance |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWait, (0,0) is |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(2,0) is |9-2| + |6-0| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next closest.\n\nBut let's see the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\nNeed to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nThat is, left, left, left, left, left, left, up, up, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after growing from eating (9,6), my tail will be at (7,6), assuming I move right from (7,6) to (8,6), then (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, let's simulate it.\n\nCurrent position: (7,9)\n\nMove down to (7,8)\n\nMove down to (7,7)\n\nMove down to (7,6)\n\nMove right to (8,6)\n\nMove right to (9,6) and eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows, so I have a tail segment at (8,6).\n\nNow, from (9,6), I want to go to (3,3).\n\nTo get to (3,3), I need to go left 6 times and up 3 times.\n\nSo, left to (8,6) - but (8,6) is my tail, which is now part of my body.\n\nWait, no. After moving to (9,6), my tail is at (8,6).\n\nSo, if I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), but (8,6) is now occupied by my tail, so I can't move there.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you move, your tail moves away by one segment.\n\nWait, in standard snake games, when you move, every part of the snake moves one step in the chosen direction, and the tail moves out accordingly.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a turn-based game, and you choose a direction, then the entire snake moves in that direction by one step.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the movement mechanics.\n\nAssuming that when you move, your head moves in the chosen direction, and the rest of the body follows, with the tail moving out accordingly.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,9) down to (7,8), then (7,9) is now occupied by the body, and so on.\n\nBut in this simple case, where I'm just moving step by step, and the snake is initially just the head, I need to consider that after eating the apple, the snake grows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (9,6), the snake will have an additional segment.\n\nTherefore, when planning the path, I need to account for the growing length.\n\nThis complicates things, as I need to ensure that the path doesn't lead to the snake colliding with its own tail.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that requires the shortest path without considering the growth, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nBut that might not be the best strategy in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should aim for the apple that is closest and in a direction that allows me to escape or have more space.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (9,6) is at the top-right, which gives me some space to grow towards the right and up.\n\nWhereas the apples at lower left are closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5), which is in the middle-left area.\n\nSo, by going to (9,6), I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is safer.\n\nAlso, the apples at (0,0), (2,0), and (4,1) are all in the bottom-left area, which is where the enemy snake is.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for (9,6) first to secure that area.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), I can plan to move towards (3,3) or another apple.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, moving from (9,6) to (3,3) would require moving left 6 and up 3, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't collide with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can move diagonally, but in this game, movement is only in the four cardinal directions.\n\nWait, actually, in standard snake games, you can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nNo diagonal movement.\n\nSo, I need to plan a path that avoids my own body and the walls.\n\nPerhaps I should consider using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or DFS to find the shortest path to the apple while avoiding obstacles.\n\nBut since this is a small grid, I can try to plan manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just move towards the closest apple and adjust as I go.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to get trapped"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (8,9), which is on the top row, second from the right. The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right.\n\nThere are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). So, multiple targets to aim for.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (2,4), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose between moving up, down, left, or right, and I have to make sure not to hit walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I can pick which apple to go for first. I should probably go for the closest one that's safe to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position (8,9) to each apple using Manhattan distance, since diagonal moves aren't allowed.\n\n1.

To (9,6): |8-9| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 4. That seems like a good target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (8,9) to (9,6):\n\n- Right to (9,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nThat's only three moves: right, down, down.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), and I'm at (8,9). So, right to (9,9), then down three times to (9,6). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut looking back at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . 2 . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A\n\n...\n\nSo, from (8,9), down to (8,8), then (8,7), (8,6), then right to (9,6).\n\nWait, actually, I'm at (8,9), and I need to get to (9,6).\n\nSo, right to (9,9), then down to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). That seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board, between (8,9) and (9,6), there don't seem to be any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (9,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan for that. I should make sure that after eating the apple, I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself.\n\nLet me think about what happens after I eat (9,6). My snake will extend, so I'll have an extra segment.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple. Let's see:\n\nFrom (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nThe other apples are farther away.\n\nSo, (3,3) is the next best target.\n\nNow, planning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left 6 times to (3,6)\n\n- Down 3 times to (3,3)\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nWait, after eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, I need to make sure that as I move left towards (3,6), I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming that the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, since the board is 10x10, and I'm moving from (9,6) to (3,3), I have enough space to maneuver without hitting walls.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is in the lower left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the enemy snake won't immediately pose a threat.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut before I proceed, I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps go for (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (2,4). If I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, that should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a distance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAgain, simple.\n\nFinally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nEasy.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail along the way.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (2,4), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, I should be safe for now.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses, the enemy snake might move towards me, so I need to stay vigilant.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows, I need to be careful not to turn back into my own body.\n\nTo minimize that risk, I should try to move in a consistent direction as much as possible.\n\nIn this case, moving right and down initially, then left and down, and so on.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of the enemy snake growing and blocking my path, but for now, I'll focus on getting to the apples efficiently.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the enemy snake is moving towards the apples in the lower left area, I might want to secure the apples in the upper right area first.\n\nGiven that, going for (9,6) first makes sense, as it's away from the enemy and closer to my current position compared to some other apples.\n\nAlright, so back to my immediate decision: where to move next?\n\nI'm at (8,9), and I want to go to (9,6).\n\nTo get from (8,9) to (9,6), I can:\n\n- Move right to (9,9)\n\n- Then down to (9,8)\n\n- Down to (9,7)\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, is there any reason to not do that?\n\nLet me check if moving right is safe.\n\nAt (9,9), there doesn't seem to be any snake or wall.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is far away.\n\nSo, moving right to (9,9) should be safe.\n\nAfter that, I can continue moving down to (9,8), (9,7), and (9,6).\n\nOnce I reach (9,6), I can eat the apple and grow.\n\nThen,"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, my snake is at position (9,7), which is towards the top-right of the board. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at top-right. So, higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nThere are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). So, multiple targets to aim for.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake at (2,3), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nMy main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince there are multiple apples, I need to decide which one to go for first. I should probably go for the closest one that's safe to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position (9,7) to each apple using Manhattan distance, since we can't move diagonally.\n\n1. To (0,0): |9-0| + |7-0| = 9 + 7 = 16\n\n2. To (2,0): |9-2| + |7-0| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (4,1): |9-4| + |7-1| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n4. To (3,3): |9-3| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n5. To (9,6): |9-9| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nHmm, the closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 1. That seems like the best target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (9,7) to (9,6):\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nThat's just one move: down.\n\nI need to make sure there are no obstacles in my way. Looking at the board, between (9,7) and (9,6), there don't seem to be any snakes or walls.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (9,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to plan for that. I should make sure that after eating the apple, I have a path to the next apple without backing into myself.\n\nLet me think about what happens after I eat (9,6). My snake will extend, so I'll have an extra segment.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple. From (9,6), the closest apple would be (3,3), which is |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, (4,1) is |9-4| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nSo, (3,3) is closer.\n\nPlanning a path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\n- Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nBut I need to ensure that my growing snake won't block my own path.\n\nAfter eating (9,6), my snake will have an extra segment. So, as I move left towards (3,6), I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAssuming the snake grows by adding a new segment at the previous position, I should be fine as long as I keep moving without turning back onto my own body.\n\nAlso, the board is 10x10, so there's enough space to maneuver.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is at (2,3), which is in the lower-left area, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (3,3) unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume it's safe.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n3. Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis seems okay.\n\nBut I should consider if there's a better path or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the positions of all the apples:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (2,0)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (9,6)\n\nI've chosen to go for (9,6) first, then (3,3). After that, perhaps (4,1), then (2,0), and finally (0,0).\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a situation where I box myself in or collide with the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,3), and I'm moving towards (9,6), which is away from the enemy, so that should be safe for now.\n\nAfter eating (9,6) and (3,3), I can plan to move to (4,1), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1):\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nDistance of 1 right and 2 downs.\n\nThen, from (4,1) to (2,0):\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Down to (2,0)\n\nAnd finally, from (2,0) to (0,0):\n\n- Left to (1,0)\n\n- Left to (0,0)\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nSo, overall, the plan seems viable.\n\nBut I need to be cautious about the enemy snake's movements and make sure I don't run into it or my own tail.\n\nGiven that, I should proceed with my initial plan.\n\nNow, focusing on my immediate move: I'm at (9,7), and I need to move down to (9,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBefore I do that, I should check if moving down is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (9,6) is occupied by an apple, so moving there will make me eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't lead me into a wall, another snake, or my own tail.\n\nFrom (9,6), I plan to move left to (8,6). Let's see:\n\n- (8,6) is empty, according to the board.\n\n- Then to (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\nAll these positions seem empty.\n\nThen down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3).\n\nAgain, these positions are empty.\n\nSo, it should be safe.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving down to (9,6) to eat the apple seems like the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n\n1.

The enemy snake (snake #2) is far away, therefore, I have a clear path to proceed. From my current position (2,0), I need to move upward and then rightward to reach the target apple (4,1).

            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this Snake game. Let's see the current situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (9,7), which is towards the top-right of the board. There are apples at (4,1), (9,6), (3,3), (0,0), and (2,0). There's also an enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. Since there are multiple apples, I need to choose the one that's closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position to each apple using Manhattan distance, as we can't move diagonally.\n\n1. To (0,0): |9-0| + |7-0| = 9 + 7 = 16\n\n2. To (2,0): |9-2| + |7-0| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (4,1): |9-4| + |7-1| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n4. To (3,3): |9-3| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n5. To (9,6): |9-9| + |7-6| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nThe closest apple is at (9,6) with a distance of only 1. That seems like the best target to go for first.\n\nLet me visualize the path from (9,7) to (9,6):\n\n- Down to (9,6)\n\nIt's just one step down. Looking at the board, (9,6) has an apple. So, moving down to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,6), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without running into my own tail.\n\nAssuming I eat the apple at (9,6), my snake will extend, and I'll need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nFrom (9,6), the next closest apple is at (3,3), with a distance of |9-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nSo, after eating (9,6), I should head towards (3,3).\n\nLet me plan the path from (9,6) to (3,3):\n\n- Left to (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\n- Then down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nI need to make sure that as I move left from (9,6) to (3,6), I don't run into my own tail or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (2,1), which is in the lower-left area, it shouldn't be in my way for now.\n\nHowever, I should keep an eye on its movement in future turns.\n\nAlso, as my snake grows, I need to ensure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nSo, after eating (9,6), I'll have an extra segment. I need to continue moving in a direction that avoids my own body.\n\nAssuming I move left from (9,6) to (8,6), then (7,6), and so on, as long as I keep moving in a straight line, I should be fine.\n\nBut I should be prepared to adjust my path if the enemy snake moves towards me or if I need to avoid my own tail.\n\nLooking ahead, after reaching (3,6), I'll need to move down to (3,5), (3,4), and then (3,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nFrom (3,3), the next closest apple is at (4,1), with a distance of |3-4| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, from (3,3), I can move right to (4,3), then down to (4,2), and then down to (4,1).\n\nAfter eating (4,1), the next apple is at (2,0), which is |4-2| + |1-0| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move left to (3,1), left to (2,1), and then down to (2,0).\n\nFinally, from (2,0), the last apple is at (0,0), which is |2-0| + |0-0| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nSo, from (2,0), I can move left to (1,0), and then left to (0,0).\n\nThis seems like a feasible plan, but I need to remain flexible in case the enemy snake poses a threat or if I need to adjust my path due to my growing length.\n\nGiven all that, my immediate move should be to move down to (9,6) to eat the apple there.\n\nWait a minute, actually, from (9,7), moving down to (9,6) is directly onto the apple.\n\nSo, for this turn, moving down to (9,6) is the way to go.\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"
