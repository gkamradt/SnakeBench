This should be the immediate target since it's safe and closest.\n   \n3. **Future Considerations**:\n   - Upon eating the apple at (8, 3), evaluating feasible routes and safety will be critical. \n   - Given the location of other apples (far left such as (3, 4) and (3, 6) and at the top (1, 9)), moving towards the central axis may provide strategic avenues to access multiple apples while maintaining mobility and safety.\n\n4. **Enemy Snake (Snake #2)**:\n    - Currently positioned at (1, 4).

This move increases the score and feeds the growth of the snake, advantaging future moves by increasing the snake's length and hence, potential surrounding control.\n\n**Strategic Note for Future Move**:\n- After consuming the apple at (8, 3), assess if moving RIGHT towards the top right corner or aiming for DOWN towards the center (if feasible without threats) to realign towards central apples is a better strategy.
