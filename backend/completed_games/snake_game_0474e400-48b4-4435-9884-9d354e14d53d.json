Let\u2019s consider our two safe options:\n\n1. If we move DOWN to (0,5), we reduce our vertical distance to apples like (2,4) immediately (from (0,5) the Manhattan distance to (2,4) is 2 + 1 = 3). However, we remain pressed against the left wall, which could limit our room to maneuver when we eventually need to head right.\n\n2. If we move RIGHT to (1,6), we shorten the horizontal gap toward the apple cluster. For example, heading from (1,6) toward (2,4) would then require a mix of right and downward moves. Moreover, moving right now takes us away from the board\u2019s left edge, providing greater maneuverability in subsequent turns.\n\nGiven our need for safe and flexible navigation toward the apple cluster\u2014and since neither option carries an immediate threat\u2014the move RIGHT seems preferable. It opens the board and makes for a smoother transition in our planned course toward apples like (2,4) and (4,5).\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

Let\u2019s consider our two safe options:\n\n1. If we move DOWN to (0,5), we reduce our vertical distance to apples like (2,4) immediately (from (0,5) the Manhattan distance to (2,4) is 2 + 1 = 3). However, we remain pressed against the left wall, which could limit our room to maneuver when we eventually need to head right.\n\n2. If we move RIGHT to (1,6), we shorten the horizontal gap toward the apple cluster. For example, heading from (1,6) toward (2,4) would then require a mix of right and downward moves. Moreover, moving right now takes us away from the board\u2019s left edge, providing greater maneuverability in subsequent turns.\n\nGiven our need for safe and flexible navigation toward the apple cluster\u2014and since neither option carries an immediate threat\u2014the move RIGHT seems preferable.

However, we remain pressed against the left wall, which could limit our room to maneuver when we eventually need to head right.\n\n2. If we move RIGHT to (1,6), we shorten the horizontal gap toward the apple cluster. For example, heading from (1,6) toward (2,4) would then require a mix of right and downward moves. Moreover, moving right now takes us away from the board\u2019s left edge, providing greater maneuverability in subsequent turns.\n\nGiven our need for safe and flexible navigation toward the apple cluster\u2014and since neither option carries an immediate threat\u2014the move RIGHT seems preferable. It opens the board and makes for a smoother transition in our planned course toward apples like (2,4) and (4,5).\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

If we move RIGHT to (1,6), we shorten the horizontal gap toward the apple cluster. For example, heading from (1,6) toward (2,4) would then require a mix of right and downward moves. Moreover, moving right now takes us away from the board\u2019s left edge, providing greater maneuverability in subsequent turns.\n\nGiven our need for safe and flexible navigation toward the apple cluster\u2014and since neither option carries an immediate threat\u2014the move RIGHT seems preferable. It opens the board and makes for a smoother transition in our planned course toward apples like (2,4) and (4,5).\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

The remaining apples are at:\n\u2022 (2,4)\n\u2022 (2,1)\n\u2022 (7,1)\n\u2022 (4,5)\n\u2022 (8,0)\n\nFrom (0,6) the immediate neighboring cells are:\n\u2013 UP: (0,7), which is occupied by our own body (the bit we just left) and would be an illegal reversal.\n\u2013 LEFT: (\u20131,6) which is off the board.\n\u2013 RIGHT: (1,6) which is free.\n\u2013 DOWN: (0,5) which is free.\n\nThe goal is to approach the cluster of apples that lie mostly \u201cto the right and downward\u201d relative to our current position. Let\u2019s consider our two safe options:\n\n1. If we move DOWN to (0,5), we reduce our vertical distance to apples like (2,4) immediately (from (0,5) the Manhattan distance to (2,4) is 2 + 1 = 3). However, we remain pressed against the left wall, which could limit our room to maneuver when we eventually need to head right.\n\n2. If we move RIGHT to (1,6), we shorten the horizontal gap toward the apple cluster. For example, heading from (1,6) toward (2,4) would then require a mix of right and downward moves. Moreover, moving right now takes us away from the board\u2019s left edge, providing greater maneuverability in subsequent turns.\n\nGiven our need for safe and flexible navigation toward the apple cluster\u2014and since neither option carries an immediate threat\u2014the move RIGHT seems preferable. It opens the board and makes for a smoother transition in our planned course toward apples like (2,4) and (4,5).\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

However, we remain pressed against the left wall, which could limit our room to maneuver when we eventually need to head right.\n\n2.

Enemy snake #1, with head at (6,6) and body at [(7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4)], is some distance away.\n\nLooking at adjacent cells from our head at (2,7):\n\u2003\u2013 UP: (2,8) is empty.\n\u2003\u2013 RIGHT: (3,7) is empty.\n\u2003\u2013 DOWN: (2,6) is empty.\n\u2003\u2013 LEFT: (1,7) is occupied by our own body\u2014definitely not an option.\n\nConsidering our apple targets, the closest by Manhattan distance is the apple at (4,5). From our head at (2,7) the Manhattan distance to (4,5) is |4\u20132|\u2009+\u2009|5\u20137| which equals 2+2 = 4. \n\nWe can approach (4,5) from different routes:\n\u2003\u2022 If we move RIGHT to (3,7), our planned path would be (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (4,5).\n\u2003\u2022 If we move DOWN to (2,6), then from (2,6) we could go to (3,6) etc.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN reduce the distance equally. However, moving DOWN from (2,7) keeps us still in column 2, and then we\u2019d have to change direction to get toward x = 4. On the other hand, moving RIGHT immediately begins advancing our x\u2011coordinate and avoids the risk of colliding with our own body, which occupies (1,7). Also, the path through (3,7) then (3,6) seems open and clear from enemy snakes.\n\nNo immediate threats are present from enemy snake #1 coming from (6,6) or its body. With a clear, direct route to the apple at (4,5), and given that none of our safe options present a risk of collision, the best move is to head RIGHT. \n\nStrategy for next turn (after moving RIGHT):\n\u2003\u2022 Continue planning to move downward toward (4,5) on subsequent moves.\n\u2003\u2022 Stay aware of enemy snake positions (especially snake #1 near (6,6)) as you approach the apple.\n\u2003\u2022 Reassess if any paths become blocked as the enemy moves.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
