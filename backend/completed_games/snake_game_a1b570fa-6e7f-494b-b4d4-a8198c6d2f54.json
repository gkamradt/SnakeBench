            "rationale": "Given the current board state and the positions of the apples and enemy snakes, the priority should be to collect the apples while avoiding collisions with the enemy snake and the walls. The closest apple is directly above at (4, 9), so the next move should be to collect that apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (4, 9), the snake should move right towards the apple at (9, 9), ensuring not to cross its own path or run into the enemy snake. Once the apple at (9, 9) is collected, the snake should move down to (9, 8) and then left to (8, 8) to avoid the enemy snake's trajectory and to position for the apple at (9, 5).\n\nFrom (8, 8), the snake should move down to (8, 7), then right to (9, 7), and finally down to (9, 5) to collect the next apple. After collecting the apple at (9, 5), the snake should move up to (9, 6) to avoid the enemy snake and then left to (8, 6) to position for the next move.\n\nThe next apple to target would be the one at (7, 9), but since the enemy snake is in the vicinity, the snake should carefully navigate towards it while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nTherefore, the next move is: UP to (4, 9) to collect the apple.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After collecting the apple at (4, 9), move RIGHT towards the apple at (9, 9), then navigate to collect the apple at (9, 5), while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake and avoiding self-collision.\n\nNext move: UP"
