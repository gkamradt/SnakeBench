So, this is not an option.\n  \n2. **Down (to (1, 7))**: This move is valid and keeps you safe from collisions.

It keeps you safe, but again, there are no apples in the immediate vicinity as you would be moving further away from most apples.\n  \n4. **Right (to (2, 8))**: This move would put you next to the enemy snake at (4, 8). It places you in a potentially dangerous position because you cannot move directly left (into your own space) or directly up or down without risking collision with the enemy snake.\n\nGiven the positioning of the enemy, it's best to steer clear from the immediate right (avoiding the enemy). \n\nWhile going down to (1, 7) is safe, it keeps the snake progressing towards obtaining apples (especially since there are apples lower on the board). Alternatively, I could move left to (0, 8), but that doesn't open up any immediate options and leads me away from clusters of apples.\n\nTo formulate a longer-term strategy:\n- I should avoid getting cornered by enemy snakes.\n- I need to maintain the flexibility to move towards the apples.\n  \nThe best option at the moment is to move **DOWN** to (1, 7). It opens future possibilities to collect apples below and doesn't place me in immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"
