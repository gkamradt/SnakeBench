Staying generally centered or along paths that allow future flexibility in movement based on the board state.\n\nConsidering this, let's look at my potential options:\n\n- Apple at (5, 7): It's fairly distant but could be a logical target since it's in an open area with fewer obstacles.\n- Apple at (9, 8): It's also distant and involves moving towards enemy territory.\n- Apple at (5, 2): Close and accessible but approaching from my current position will take a few moves.\n- Apple at (7, 2): Slightly harder to reach due to current barriers and possible congestion.\n- Apple at (4, 7): Optimal on a mix of routes but strategic positioning calls for careful open traversals.\n\nGiven my position and the nearest apples, focusing on the apple at (5, 2) initially seems advantageous as it's the closest. Next move consideration aligns with heading right, which keeps me centralized while allowing directional options in following turns.\n\nThinking about the next steps for following turns, I should avoid being bottlenecked near walls and track the movement of the enemy snake to ensure I have an escape route if needed.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
