This move will score me a point and grow my snake.\n\n2. **Alternative Moves**:\n   - **UP to (6, 3)** would return me to my previous position and waste a turn, plus I wouldn\u2019t be moving toward any apples.\n   - **LEFT to (5, 2)** would move me away from the apples.\n   - **RIGHT to (7, 2)** also takes me away from the nearest apple.\n\n### Enemy Consideration:\nThe enemy snake is at (8, 2), which is below and to the right of my current position. It won't intercept my moves unless I stray into its territory, which I am not doing since I am focusing on collecting apples.\n\n### Short-Term Strategy:\nTo maximize my score and continue my growth, I should prioritize collecting apples immediately when they are within reach.

Hence, I have to analyze that I must keep focused on moving towards the apple at (6, 4) by plotting a course that stays clear of the enemy at (8, 1).\n\n### Decision:\nI decide to move **UP to (6, 2)**.\n\nNext move: UP."
