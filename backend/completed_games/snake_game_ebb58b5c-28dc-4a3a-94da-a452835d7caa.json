It\u2019s safe, but not immediately advantageous.\n\u2003\u2022 RIGHT: (2,6) \u2013 The board shows this spot is empty, and heading right along row 6 leads us toward the apple at (5,6).\n\n3. Our objective is to increase our score by eating apples with minimal risk. The apple at (5,6) on row 6 is along a clear, direct path if we continue right.\n\n4. Enemy snake #1 is far enough away (currently at (3,4) with body parts at (2,4) and (1,4)) that heading right on row 6 doesn\u2019t put us in immediate conflict.\n\nTherefore, the best move now is to head RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
