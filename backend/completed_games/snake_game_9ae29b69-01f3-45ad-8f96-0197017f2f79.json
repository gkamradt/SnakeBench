The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (6,6), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and apple collection.\n\nStarting with UP: Moving up would take me to (6,7). Is that safe? Let's check the board. The next positions would be (6,7). There's no snake there. The enemy snake is at (3,5), so that's far. So UP is safe. But there's no apple there. So moving UP would just be a safe move but no points.\n\nDOWN: Moving to (6,5). Wait, (6,5) is an apple! So if I go DOWN, I can eat the apple and grow. But I need to check if that's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is different from (6,5). So moving to (6,5) would get the apple. But after eating, my body would grow. But since the enemy's body is empty, maybe they can move there too. Wait, but the enemy is at (3,5), which is a different position. So (6,5) is safe. So DOWN is a good option to get the apple.\n\nLEFT: Moving to (5,6). Is that safe? Let's see. Are there any snakes there? The enemy is at (3,5), so no. So moving LEFT to (5,6) is safe. But there's no apple there. So that's a safe move but no points.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (7,6). That's safe as well. No apples there. So same as LEFT.\n\nSo the best option seems to be DOWN to get the apple at (6,5). But wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after moving down, the next move would have the tail stay in place, but since the snake grows, the body would extend. But since the current body is only at (6,6), moving down to (6,5) would make the new head at (6,5), and the body would be [(6,6)]. So next turn, the body would be there. But for this move, the only thing to check is if moving to (6,5) is safe. Since there's an apple there, and no other snakes, it's safe.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (3,5). So (3,5) is their head. They could move towards (6,5) as well. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. But since they are at (3,5), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right, they go to (4,5). If they move down, (3,4). If they move up, (3,6). So they can't reach (6,5) in one move. So (6,5) is safe for me to move into.\n\nSo moving DOWN to (6,5) would get the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's the best option. The other apples are further away. For example, (8,8) is two steps right and two up. (4,8) is two left and two up. (2,8) is four left and two up. (2,5) is four left and one down. So the closest apple is (6,5), which is directly below me. So definitely go for that.\n\nBut wait, what if the enemy snake is planning to move towards (6,5)? But since they are at (3,5), they can't reach (6,5) in one move. So even if they move towards it, they can't get there this turn. So I can safely take the apple.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN. Then, next turn, I can plan to go towards another apple, maybe (4,8) or (8,8), but that's for the next move. For now, secure the closest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN\n\n**Direction:** DOWN  \n**Rationale:** The closest apple is directly below at (6,5). Moving DOWN allows the snake to safely consume the apple, grow, and gain a point without collision risks. Other directions don't lead to immediate points. Next turn, consider targeting nearby apples like (4,8) or (8,8) after assessing the new board state."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. After moving DOWN last turn, my snake's head is now at (6,5) because that's where the apple was. Since I ate the apple, my body should have grown. So my current body positions are probably [(6,6), (6,5)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the next segment is added when you move. So after moving from (6,6) to (6,5) and eating the apple, the body would now be [(6,6), (6,5)]? Or does the tail stay in place and the head moves, adding a new segment? Hmm, maybe the snake's body grows by one segment when it eats an apple. So if I was just the head at (6,6) before, moving to (6,5) and eating the apple would make my body now have two segments: head at (6,5) and the previous position at (6,6). So my current length is 2.\n\nNow, the apples are at (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, but I just ate the apple at (6,5), so that one should be gone now. Wait, the initial list of apples was (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). But in the previous move, I moved to (6,5) which was an apple. So that apple is now consumed, so the current apples should be the remaining ones: (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0) minus (6,5). Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the apples were listed as (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). But in the board state provided, there's an 'A' at (6,5) in row 5. So after eating that, the apple at (6,5) is gone. So the current apples are the original list minus (6,5). So the apples now are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, no, because the initial list included (6,5) as an apple? Wait, looking back: the user said \"Apples at: (8, 8), (4, 8), (2, 8), (2, 5), (3, 0)\". Wait, no, (6,5) wasn't in the initial list. Wait, in the original problem statement, the apples were at (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). But in the board state provided, there's an 'A' at (6,5) in row 5. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem statement says:\n\nApples at: (8, 8), (4, 8), (2, 8), (2, 5), (3, 0)\n\nBut in the board state:\n\nRow 5 (which is y=5) shows an 'A' at (6,5). So that's an apple at (6,5). But the initial list didn't include that. So perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement. Or maybe the board state includes the apple at (6,5) which was added after the initial list. Wait, but the user's last move information says that after moving DOWN, they ate the apple at (6,5). So in the current state, that apple is gone. Therefore, the current apples are the original list minus (6,5). So the apples now are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, but (6,5) wasn't in the original list. So maybe the problem statement had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the apple at (6,5) was added after the initial list. Hmm, this is confusing. But according to the board state provided in the initial problem, there was an 'A' at (6,5), which the user's snake moved into. So after that move, that apple is consumed. Therefore, the current apples are the original list minus (6,5). But the original list didn't include (6,5). So perhaps there's an error here. Alternatively, maybe the initial list was incorrect. But given that the board state shows an 'A' at (6,5), that's the apple that was there. So after eating it, that apple is gone. So the remaining apples are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, but (6,5) wasn't in that list. So maybe the problem statement had a mistake. But regardless, after moving to (6,5), that apple is now gone. So the current apples are the original list minus (6,5), but since (6,5) wasn't in the original list, perhaps the apples are still the same. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal problem statement says:\n\nApples at: (8, 8), (4, 8), (2, 8), (2, 5), (3, 0)\n\nBut in the board state provided, row 5 (y=5) has an 'A' at (6,5). So that's an apple at (6,5) which wasn't listed. So perhaps the initial list was incomplete. But the user's last move was to go DOWN to (6,5) to eat that apple. So now, that apple is gone. Therefore, the current apples are the original list minus (6,5), but since (6,5) wasn't in the original list, perhaps the apples are still the original ones. This is a bit conflicting, but perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the apple at (6,5) was added after the initial list. But regardless, after moving to (6,5), that apple is consumed. So the current apples are the original list minus (6,5). But since (6,5) wasn't in the original list, perhaps the apples are still the original ones. This is a bit confusing, but I'll proceed with the information given.\n\nNow, my snake's head is at (6,5), and the body is at (6,6). So the body is one segment behind. The enemy snake is at (4,5) with body at []. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the enemy snake was at (4,5) with body at []. So snake #2 is at (4,5), and their body is empty, meaning they are just a head. So they can move in any direction, but their next move will determine their new position.\n\nNow, my current position is (6,5). Possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP: Moving to (6,6). But that's where my body is. So moving UP would collide with my own body. That's a death. So UP is not safe.\n\nDOWN: Moving to (6,4). Is that safe? Let's check if there's any snake there. The enemy is at (4,5). So (6,4) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nLEFT: Moving to (5,5). Check for snakes. Enemy is at (4,5), which is to the left of (5,5). So (5,5) is safe.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (7,5). Also safe, no snakes there.\n\nSo possible safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The remaining apples are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Let's see which of these are reachable.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- (8,8): To the right 2 and up 3. That's a bit far.\n- (4,8): Left 2 and up 3.\n- (2,8): Left 4 and up 3.\n- (2,5): Left 4 and same y.\n- (3,0): Left 3 and down 5.\n\nThe closest apples are (4,8) and (2,5). Let's see which direction can get me closer.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,5), then towards (4,8) would require moving left and up. From (5,5), moving left to (4,5) (but enemy is at (4,5)), so that's dangerous. Alternatively, moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then left to (4,6), etc. But that's a longer path.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5), then towards (8,8) would require moving right and up. From (7,5), moving right to (8,5), then up to (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). That's three moves. But that's a possible path.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,4), then towards (3,0) would require moving left and down. But (3,0) is far and moving down would take me away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the closest apple is (2,5). From (6,5), moving left four times. But that's a straight line left. However, the enemy is at (4,5), so moving left to (5,5), then (4,5) is where the enemy is. So moving left towards (2,5) would require passing through (4,5), which is the enemy's current position. But the enemy could move away. However, if I move left to (5,5), then next turn, if the enemy is still at (4,5), moving left again would take me to (4,5), which is where the enemy is. So that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,5) and then up towards (4,8). But again, the enemy is at (4,5), so moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then left to (4,6), then up to (4,7), (4,8). That's three moves. But the enemy might be moving around.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (7,5) and then up towards (8,8). That path is safer as there's no enemy in that direction.\n\nSo which direction is better? Let's assess the risks and rewards.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,5) could lead towards (4,8) but requires navigating around the enemy. Moving RIGHT towards (8,8) is safer but longer. Moving DOWN to (6,4) doesn't lead towards any apples immediately but keeps me safe.\n\nWait, but (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,5), moving left four times. But the enemy is at (4,5). So moving left to (5,5), then (4,5) is enemy's position. So I can't go there. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go down to (6,4), then left to (5,4), etc., to approach (2,5) from below. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (3,0) is far down. Moving down to (6,4), then further down to (6,3), etc., but that's a long way.\n\nSo the safest move might be to go RIGHT towards (8,8) or LEFT towards (4,8), but need to avoid the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,5) with an empty body, so they can move in any direction. If I move LEFT to (5,5), the enemy could move in any direction. For example, if the enemy moves RIGHT to (5,5), then we would collide. But since the enemy is at (4,5), their possible moves are UP to (4,6), DOWN to (4,4), LEFT to (3,5), or RIGHT to (5,5). So if I move LEFT to (5,5), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (5,5), we both end up there, causing a collision. So that's a risk. Therefore, moving LEFT to (5,5) is risky because the enemy might move into the same spot.\n\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe because the enemy is at (4,5) and can't reach (7,5) in one move. The enemy's possible moves are to (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), or (5,5). So moving RIGHT is safer.\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,4) is also safe, but not leading towards any apples immediately.\n\nSo the best options are RIGHT or LEFT, but considering the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5), that's safe. Then next turn, I can move towards (8,8). From (7,5), moving RIGHT to (8,5), then UP to (8,6), etc. That's a path to the apple at (8,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,5) is risky because the enemy might move into (5,5). So perhaps avoiding that.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Moving RIGHT gets me closer to (8,8), which is an apple. Moving DOWN keeps me safe but doesn't get me closer to apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,4) and then LEFT to (5,4), etc., but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,5) is still there. But to get there, I need to move left past the enemy. But that's risky.\n\nHmm. So the safest move with potential for apple collection is RIGHT towards (8,8). Let's check the distance. From (6,5) to (8,8): x difference 2, y difference 3. So total of 5 moves. But moving RIGHT now would start that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP is not possible because it's my own body.\n\nSo the possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT is risky. So the best options are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5), that's safe. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (8,5), then UP to (8,6), etc. That's a path to (8,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,4) is safe but not helpful for apples.\n\nSo the best choice is RIGHT to start heading towards (8,8).\n\nBut wait, is there any apple closer in another direction? The apple at (4,8) is at x=4, y=8. From (6,5), moving left 2 and up 3. That's a possible path. But moving left would require passing near the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP is blocked by my own body. So can't do that.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. RIGHT is better for apple collection, DOWN is safer but no progress.\n\nBut since the goal is to collect apples, moving RIGHT is better.\n\nBut wait, what if there's an apple at (4,8) that I can reach by moving left and up. But moving left to (5,5) is risky. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,5), moving left 4. But the enemy is at (4,5), so moving left to (5,5), then (4,5) is enemy's spot. So can't go there. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo the best option is to move RIGHT towards (8,8).\n\nTherefore, the direction should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT  \n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe and starts a path towards the apple at (8,8). Avoiding LEFT due to collision risk with the enemy snake at (4,5). Next turn, continue right to approach (8,8) while monitoring enemy movements."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (6,6). The apples are at (8,8), (4,8), (6,5), (2,8), (2,5). The enemy snake is at (3,5) with an empty body, so it's just a head. The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (6,6), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and apple collection.\n\nStarting with UP: Moving up would take me to (6,7). Is that safe? Let's check the board. The next positions would be (6,7). There's no snake there. The enemy snake is at (3,5), so that's far. So UP is safe. But there's no apple there. So moving UP would just be a safe move but no points.\n\nDOWN: Moving to (6,5). Wait, (6,5) is an apple! So if I go DOWN, I can eat the apple and grow. But I need to check if that's safe. The enemy snake is at (3,5), which is different from (6,5). So moving to (6,5) would get the apple. But after eating, my body would grow. But since the enemy's body is empty, maybe they can move there too. Wait, but the enemy is at (3,5), which is a different position. So (6,5) is safe. So DOWN is a good option to get the apple.\n\nLEFT: Moving to (5,6). Is that safe? Let's see. Are there any snakes there? The enemy is at (3,5), so no. So moving LEFT to (5,6) is safe. But there's no apple there. So that's a safe move but no points.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (7,6). That's safe as well. No apples there. So same as LEFT.\n\nSo the best option seems to be DOWN to get the apple at (6,5). But wait, when you eat an apple, you grow. So after moving down, the next move would have the tail stay in place, but since the snake grows, the body would extend. But since the current body is only at (6,6), moving down to (6,5) would make the new head at (6,5), and the body would be [(6,6)]. So next turn, the body would be there. But for this move, the only thing to check is if moving to (6,5) is safe. Since there's an apple there, and no other snakes, it's safe.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (3,5). So (3,5) is their head. They could move towards (6,5) as well. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. But since they are at (3,5), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right, they go to (4,5). If they move down, (3,4). If they move up, (3,6). So they can't reach (6,5) in one move. So (6,5) is safe for me to move into.\n\nSo moving DOWN to (6,5) would get the apple, gain a point, and grow. That's the best option. The other apples are further away. For example, (8,8) is two steps right and two up. (4,8) is two left and two up. (2,8) is four left and two up. (2,5) is four left and one down. So the closest apple is (6,5), which is directly below me. So definitely go for that.\n\nBut wait, what if the enemy snake is planning to move towards (6,5)? But since they are at (3,5), they can't reach (6,5) in one move. So even if they move towards it, they can't get there this turn. So I can safely take the apple.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN. Then, next turn, I can plan to go towards another apple, maybe (4,8) or (8,8), but that's for the next move. For now, secure the closest apple.\n</think>\n\nDOWN\n\n**Direction:** DOWN  \n**Rationale:** The closest apple is directly below at (6,5). Moving DOWN allows the snake to safely consume the apple, grow, and gain a point without collision risks. Other directions don't lead to immediate points. Next turn, consider targeting nearby apples like (4,8) or (8,8) after assessing the new board state."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. After moving DOWN last turn, my snake's head is now at (6,5) because that's where the apple was. Since I ate the apple, my body should have grown. So my current body positions are probably [(6,6), (6,5)]? Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the next segment is added when you move. So after moving from (6,6) to (6,5) and eating the apple, the body would now be [(6,6), (6,5)]? Or does the tail stay in place and the head moves, adding a new segment? Hmm, maybe the snake's body grows by one segment when it eats an apple. So if I was just the head at (6,6) before, moving to (6,5) and eating the apple would make my body now have two segments: head at (6,5) and the previous position at (6,6). So my current length is 2.\n\nNow, the apples are at (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, but I just ate the apple at (6,5), so that one should be gone now. Wait, the initial list of apples was (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). But in the previous move, I moved to (6,5) which was an apple. So that apple is now consumed, so the current apples should be the remaining ones: (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0) minus (6,5). Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the apples were listed as (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). But in the board state provided, there's an 'A' at (6,5) in row 5. So after eating that, the apple at (6,5) is gone. So the current apples are the original list minus (6,5). So the apples now are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, no, because the initial list included (6,5) as an apple? Wait, looking back: the user said \"Apples at: (8, 8), (4, 8), (2, 8), (2, 5), (3, 0)\". Wait, no, (6,5) wasn't in the initial list. Wait, in the original problem statement, the apples were at (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). But in the board state provided, there's an 'A' at (6,5) in row 5. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem statement says:\n\nApples at: (8, 8), (4, 8), (2, 8), (2, 5), (3, 0)\n\nBut in the board state:\n\nRow 5 (which is y=5) shows an 'A' at (6,5). So that's an apple at (6,5). But the initial list didn't include that. So perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement. Or maybe the board state includes the apple at (6,5) which was added after the initial list. Wait, but the user's last move information says that after moving DOWN, they ate the apple at (6,5). So in the current state, that apple is gone. Therefore, the current apples are the original list minus (6,5). So the apples now are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, but (6,5) wasn't in the original list. So maybe the problem statement had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the apple at (6,5) was added after the initial list. Hmm, this is confusing. But according to the board state provided in the initial problem, there was an 'A' at (6,5), which the user's snake moved into. So after that move, that apple is consumed. Therefore, the current apples are the original list minus (6,5). But the original list didn't include (6,5). So perhaps there's an error here. Alternatively, maybe the initial list was incorrect. But given that the board state shows an 'A' at (6,5), that's the apple that was there. So after eating it, that apple is gone. So the remaining apples are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, but (6,5) wasn't in that list. So maybe the problem statement had a mistake. But regardless, after moving to (6,5), that apple is now gone. So the current apples are the original list minus (6,5), but since (6,5) wasn't in the original list, perhaps the apples are still the same. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal problem statement says:\n\nApples at: (8, 8), (4, 8), (2, 8), (2, 5), (3, 0)\n\nBut in the board state provided, row 5 (y=5) has an 'A' at (6,5). So that's an apple at (6,5) which wasn't listed. So perhaps the initial list was incomplete. But the user's last move was to go DOWN to (6,5) to eat that apple. So now, that apple is gone. Therefore, the current apples are the original list minus (6,5), but since (6,5) wasn't in the original list, perhaps the apples are still the original ones. This is a bit conflicting, but perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the apple at (6,5) was added after the initial list. But regardless, after moving to (6,5), that apple is consumed. So the current apples are the original list minus (6,5). But since (6,5) wasn't in the original list, perhaps the apples are still the original ones. This is a bit confusing, but I'll proceed with the information given.\n\nNow, my snake's head is at (6,5), and the body is at (6,6). So the body is one segment behind. The enemy snake is at (4,5) with body at []. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the enemy snake was at (4,5) with body at []. So snake #2 is at (4,5), and their body is empty, meaning they are just a head. So they can move in any direction, but their next move will determine their new position.\n\nNow, my current position is (6,5). Possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP: Moving to (6,6). But that's where my body is. So moving UP would collide with my own body. That's a death. So UP is not safe.\n\nDOWN: Moving to (6,4). Is that safe? Let's check if there's any snake there. The enemy is at (4,5). So (6,4) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nLEFT: Moving to (5,5). Check for snakes. Enemy is at (4,5), which is to the left of (5,5). So (5,5) is safe.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (7,5). Also safe, no snakes there.\n\nSo possible safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The remaining apples are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Let's see which of these are reachable.\n\nFrom (6,5):\n\n- (8,8): To the right 2 and up 3. That's a bit far.\n- (4,8): Left 2 and up 3.\n- (2,8): Left 4 and up 3.\n- (2,5): Left 4 and same y.\n- (3,0): Left 3 and down 5.\n\nThe closest apples are (4,8) and (2,5). Let's see which direction can get me closer.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,5), then towards (4,8) would require moving left and up. From (5,5), moving left to (4,5) (but enemy is at (4,5)), so that's dangerous. Alternatively, moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then left to (4,6), etc. But that's a longer path.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5), then towards (8,8) would require moving right and up. From (7,5), moving right to (8,5), then up to (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). That's three moves. But that's a possible path.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,4), then towards (3,0) would require moving left and down. But (3,0) is far and moving down would take me away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the closest apple is (2,5). From (6,5), moving left four times. But that's a straight line left. However, the enemy is at (4,5), so moving left to (5,5), then (4,5) is where the enemy is. So moving left towards (2,5) would require passing through (4,5), which is the enemy's current position. But the enemy could move away. However, if I move left to (5,5), then next turn, if the enemy is still at (4,5), moving left again would take me to (4,5), which is where the enemy is. So that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,5) and then up towards (4,8). But again, the enemy is at (4,5), so moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then left to (4,6), then up to (4,7), (4,8). That's three moves. But the enemy might be moving around.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (7,5) and then up towards (8,8). That path is safer as there's no enemy in that direction.\n\nSo which direction is better? Let's assess the risks and rewards.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,5) could lead towards (4,8) but requires navigating around the enemy. Moving RIGHT towards (8,8) is safer but longer. Moving DOWN to (6,4) doesn't lead towards any apples immediately but keeps me safe.\n\nWait, but (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,5), moving left four times. But the enemy is at (4,5). So moving left to (5,5), then (4,5) is enemy's position. So I can't go there. So maybe that path is blocked by the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go down to (6,4), then left to (5,4), etc., to approach (2,5) from below. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (3,0) is far down. Moving down to (6,4), then further down to (6,3), etc., but that's a long way.\n\nSo the safest move might be to go RIGHT towards (8,8) or LEFT towards (4,8), but need to avoid the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,5) with an empty body, so they can move in any direction. If I move LEFT to (5,5), the enemy could move in any direction. For example, if the enemy moves RIGHT to (5,5), then we would collide. But since the enemy is at (4,5), their possible moves are UP to (4,6), DOWN to (4,4), LEFT to (3,5), or RIGHT to (5,5). So if I move LEFT to (5,5), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (5,5), we both end up there, causing a collision. So that's a risk. Therefore, moving LEFT to (5,5) is risky because the enemy might move into the same spot.\n\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe because the enemy is at (4,5) and can't reach (7,5) in one move. The enemy's possible moves are to (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), or (5,5). So moving RIGHT is safer.\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,4) is also safe, but not leading towards any apples immediately.\n\nSo the best options are RIGHT or LEFT, but considering the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5), that's safe. Then next turn, I can move towards (8,8). From (7,5), moving RIGHT to (8,5), then UP to (8,6), etc. That's a path to the apple at (8,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,5) is risky because the enemy might move into (5,5). So perhaps avoiding that.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Moving RIGHT gets me closer to (8,8), which is an apple. Moving DOWN keeps me safe but doesn't get me closer to apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,4) and then LEFT to (5,4), etc., but that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,5) is still there. But to get there, I need to move left past the enemy. But that's risky.\n\nHmm. So the safest move with potential for apple collection is RIGHT towards (8,8). Let's check the distance. From (6,5) to (8,8): x difference 2, y difference 3. So total of 5 moves. But moving RIGHT now would start that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP is not possible because it's my own body.\n\nSo the possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT is risky. So the best options are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,5), that's safe. Then next move could be RIGHT again to (8,5), then UP to (8,6), etc. That's a path to (8,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,4) is safe but not helpful for apples.\n\nSo the best choice is RIGHT to start heading towards (8,8).\n\nBut wait, is there any apple closer in another direction? The apple at (4,8) is at x=4, y=8. From (6,5), moving left 2 and up 3. That's a possible path. But moving left would require passing near the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP is blocked by my own body. So can't do that.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. RIGHT is better for apple collection, DOWN is safer but no progress.\n\nBut since the goal is to collect apples, moving RIGHT is better.\n\nBut wait, what if there's an apple at (4,8) that I can reach by moving left and up. But moving left to (5,5) is risky. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,5), moving left 4. But the enemy is at (4,5), so moving left to (5,5), then (4,5) is enemy's spot. So can't go there. So that path is blocked.\n\nSo the best option is to move RIGHT towards (8,8).\n\nTherefore, the direction should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT  \n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe and starts a path towards the apple at (8,8).

Wait, wait, the user's last move information says that after moving RIGHT, the snake's head is at (7,5). The previous move was from (6,5) to (7,5) by moving RIGHT. The apples listed are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). But in the board state provided after the last move, the snake is at (7,5), and the enemy snake #2 is at (5,5) with body at [].\n\nWait, the initial problem statement after the last move shows the board state as:\n\n 5 . . A . . 2 T 1 . .\n\nWait, in row 5 (y=5), the columns 0-9 are represented. The '1' is at (7,5), which is the head. The 'T' is at (6,5), which is the tail. So the snake's body is [(7,5), (6,5)]. So the snake has a length of 2 now. The enemy snake #2 is at (5,5) with body at [], so just the head.\n\nApples currently on the board are (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). Wait, but in the board state, there's an 'A' at (2,5) and (3,0), but also at (8,8), (4,8), (2,8). The apple at (6,5) was eaten in the previous move, so it's no longer present.\n\nNow, my current position is (7,5). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n- UP: (7,6). Is that safe? The snake's body is at (6,5), so (7,6) is empty. No enemy there. Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,4). Also empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,5). That's the tail of my snake. Since the snake's body is [(7,5), (6,5)], moving LEFT would go into the tail. But in some snake rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail moves forward. Wait, but in this case, when you move, the tail follows. So if the snake is moving LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), the tail would move from (6,5) to (5,5) if the snake didn't eat an apple. But since the snake just ate an apple in the previous move (when moving RIGHT to (7,5)), the tail would stay in place, and the body grows. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen a snake eats an apple, the next move causes the snake to grow. So after eating an apple, the snake's length increases by one. So when the snake moves into a new position and eats an apple, the tail doesn't move in the next move. So in the previous move, the snake was at (6,5) (head) and (6,6) (tail). Then it moved RIGHT to (7,5), ate the apple there (assuming there was one, but according to the problem statement, the apples were at (8,8), etc., so maybe there was an apple at (7,5)? Wait, no. Wait, the initial apples were listed as (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). But in the board state after the last move, there's an 'A' at (2,5), (3,0), (8,8), (4,8), (2,8). So the apple at (7,5) wasn't present. Therefore, moving RIGHT to (7,5) didn't eat an apple. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's last move information says:\n\nDirection: RIGHT  \nRationale: Moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe and starts a path towards the apple at (8,8). Avoiding LEFT due to collision risk with the enemy snake at (4,5). Next turn, continue right to approach (8,8) while monitoring enemy movements.\n\nBut in the initial problem statement, the apples were at (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0). So moving RIGHT to (7,5) didn't eat an apple. Therefore, the snake's body is now [(7,5), (6,5)], and the tail is at (6,5). So when moving LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5), that's the tail. In some snake rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward, so the head can occupy the tail's previous position without dying. But in other rules, it's considered a collision. The problem statement's rules say: \"If you run into ... yourself (like go backwards), you die.\" So moving into your own body (including the tail) is a collision. Wait, but the tail is part of the body. So if the snake's body is [(7,5), (6,5)], moving LEFT to (6,5) would collide with the tail, causing death. Therefore, LEFT is not a valid move.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each:\n\n- UP: (7,6). Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,4). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,5). Safe, within the board.\n\nNow, looking for apples. The apples are at (8,8), (4,8), (2,8), (2,5), (3,0).\n\nFrom (7,5):\n\n- The closest apple is (8,8). To reach it, move RIGHT to (8,5), then UP three times. That's four moves.\n- The apple at (2,5) is to the left, but passing through enemy at (5,5).\n- The apple at (4,8) is up and left.\n- The apple at (3,0) is down and left.\n\nThe most strategic apple to target is (8,8) as it's in the direction of RIGHT and UP. Moving RIGHT now to (8,5) would get closer. Then UP to (8,6), (8,7), (8,8).\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (7,5) to (7,6) could start a path towards (4,8) or (2,8), but those are further and require moving left, which is towards the enemy.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,5). Their possible moves are UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), or RIGHT to (6,5). If they move RIGHT to (6,5), that's my tail's position. But since my tail is at (6,5), if the enemy moves there, they would collide with my tail. But according to the rules, colliding with another snake's body is a death for the moving snake. So if the enemy moves into (6,5), they die. But I need to avoid moving into their path.\n\nMy safest path is towards (8,8). Moving RIGHT to (8,5) is safe. Then next move UP to (8,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,6) could allow me to turn right towards (8,6), but that's an extra step.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (8,5), getting closer to (8,8).\n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (8,5) is on the edge of the board (x=8, y=5). From there, moving UP thrice to reach (8,8). That path is clear of enemies and apples.\n\nTherefore, the direction should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT  \n**Rationale:** Continuing towards the apple at (8,8) by moving RIGHT to (8,5). This path avoids the enemy at (5,5) and positions the snake closer to the target. Next turn, plan to move UP to approach (8,8) while ensuring no collisions."
