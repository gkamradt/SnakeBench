Great start!\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (8, 8) is still my best target. It's in a corner which could provide some safety. To get there, I'll need to navigate carefully and avoid colliding with the walls or my own growing body.\n\nSnake #2 is still at (5, 2) and doesn't seem to have moved last turn. I'll need to keep an eye on them as I make my way across the board. If they start heading towards the (8, 8) apple, I may need to adjust my path.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns will be:\n1) Steadily make my way towards (8, 8), taking the safest path \n2) Avoid collisions at all costs - losing to Snake #2 by points is better than dying\n3) Monitor Snake #2's movements and be ready to adapt if needed\n4) Once I'm in the top right corner near (8, 8), re-evaluate targets based on Snake #2's position and the remaining apples\n\nFor this turn, I will move DOWN to (0, 8).
