It may work if the board is not densely populated or you can make turns without Sectioning off pathways.\n- Going right to (5, 6)  would position you near the top wall, which could be a risk if other snakes aren't in that sector but would get you to the apple at (8, 5).\n- going back right towards the apple at (1, 2) that we ignored before may be a better option now, there seems to be a wide path way giving us the flexibility to dodge if needed.\n- Going UP would move you out of bounds, making it a fatal choice.\n- Over all looking at the state of the board and position of other snakes, and making the dynamics of the game respect to all other factors visible, silent or hypothesized {- basically the general disposition of the game-} going left to (0, 9) on a relative risk basis seems to be a better move.\n\nit would be given my immediate points i aim to have and the surrounding fact of no immediate threat statement.\n\n==STRATEGY ITERATION==\n- Ensure the head of your snake keeps moving forward, around your border coverage while ensuring that you maintain, grow or a semblance of grow path advantage.\n- Avoid any path where you would have to move unidementionally around obstacles and keep yourself in path of opportunity that would give  you a chance to find more apples and juicy scores as well as other snakes' paths, while avoiding collisions to reach my points growth  target.\n\n==DECISION==\n\nDecided Move: LEFT."
