(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4. (3, 8): The Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |8-3| = 7.\n5. (8, 6): The Manhattan distance is |8-1| + |6-3| = 10.\n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is the closest, with a distance of 2. Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it. It will not interfere with my immediate movement path to (0, 2), as it's far away from my snake's current position.\n\n### Movement Options\nFrom my current position (1, 3), I can move in the following directions:\n- **UP (to 1, 4):** Keeps me on a generally safe path.\n- **LEFT (to 0, 3):** Moves me directly towards the apple at (0, 2).\n- **DOWN or RIGHT:** These directions take me away from the nearest apple and are not strategic.\n\n### Decision\nSince moving LEFT (to 0, 3) aligns with the goal of reaching the nearest apple at (0, 2) quickly and safely, this move maximizes my chances of increasing my score without immediate risks.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4.

(3, 8): The Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |8-3| = 7.\n5. (8, 6): The Manhattan distance is |8-1| + |6-3| = 10.\n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is the closest, with a distance of 2. Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it. It will not interfere with my immediate movement path to (0, 2), as it's far away from my snake's current position.\n\n### Movement Options\nFrom my current position (1, 3), I can move in the following directions:\n- **UP (to 1, 4):** Keeps me on a generally safe path.\n- **LEFT (to 0, 3):** Moves me directly towards the apple at (0, 2).\n- **DOWN or RIGHT:** These directions take me away from the nearest apple and are not strategic.\n\n### Decision\nSince moving LEFT (to 0, 3) aligns with the goal of reaching the nearest apple at (0, 2) quickly and safely, this move maximizes my chances of increasing my score without immediate risks.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

Moving right would bring me closer to the apple at (5, 8), but it would also bring me closer to the enemy snake. Moving left would bring me closer to the apple at (0, 2), but it would also bring me closer to the wall.\n\nGiven that I'm currently at a higher position than the apples, moving down (UP would result in a collision with the wall) might be a good strategy to reach the apples at (6, 1) or (8, 6) more easily.

(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4. (3, 8): The Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |8-3| = 7.\n5. (8, 6): The Manhattan distance is |8-1| + |6-3| = 10.\n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is the closest, with a distance of 2. Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it. It will not interfere with my immediate movement path to (0, 2), as it's far away from my snake's current position.\n\n### Movement Options\nFrom my current position (1, 3), I can move in the following directions:\n- **UP (to 1, 4):** Keeps me on a generally safe path.\n- **LEFT (to 0, 3):** Moves me directly towards the apple at (0, 2).\n- **DOWN or RIGHT:** These directions take me away from the nearest apple and are not strategic.\n\n### Decision\nSince moving LEFT (to 0, 3) aligns with the goal of reaching the nearest apple at (0, 2) quickly and safely, this move maximizes my chances of increasing my score without immediate risks.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4.

Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it.

(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4. (3, 8): The Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |8-3| = 7.\n5. (8, 6): The Manhattan distance is |8-1| + |6-3| = 10.\n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is the closest, with a distance of 2. Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it. It will not interfere with my immediate movement path to (0, 2), as it's far away from my snake's current position.\n\n### Movement Options\nFrom my current position (1, 3), I can move in the following directions:\n- **UP (to 1, 4):** Keeps me on a generally safe path.\n- **LEFT (to 0, 3):** Moves me directly towards the apple at (0, 2).\n- **DOWN or RIGHT:** These directions take me away from the nearest apple and are not strategic.\n\n### Decision\nSince moving LEFT (to 0, 3) aligns with the goal of reaching the nearest apple at (0, 2) quickly and safely, this move maximizes my chances of increasing my score without immediate risks.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4. (3, 8): The Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |8-3| = 7.\n5. (8, 6): The Manhattan distance is |8-1| + |6-3| = 10.\n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is the closest, with a distance of 2. Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it. It will not interfere with my immediate movement path to (0, 2), as it's far away from my snake's current position.\n\n### Movement Options\nFrom my current position (1, 3), I can move in the following directions:\n- **UP (to 1, 4):** Keeps me on a generally safe path.\n- **LEFT (to 0, 3):** Moves me directly towards the apple at (0, 2).\n- **DOWN or RIGHT:** These directions take me away from the nearest apple and are not strategic.\n\n### Decision\nSince moving LEFT (to 0, 3) aligns with the goal of reaching the nearest apple at (0, 2) quickly and safely, this move maximizes my chances of increasing my score without immediate risks.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4.

Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it.

(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4. (3, 8): The Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |8-3| = 7.\n5. (8, 6): The Manhattan distance is |8-1| + |6-3| = 10.\n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is the closest, with a distance of 2. Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it. It will not interfere with my immediate movement path to (0, 2), as it's far away from my snake's current position.\n\n### Movement Options\nFrom my current position (1, 3), I can move in the following directions:\n- **UP (to 1, 4):** Keeps me on a generally safe path.\n- **LEFT (to 0, 3):** Moves me directly towards the apple at (0, 2).\n- **DOWN or RIGHT:** These directions take me away from the nearest apple and are not strategic.\n\n### Decision\nSince moving LEFT (to 0, 3) aligns with the goal of reaching the nearest apple at (0, 2) quickly and safely, this move maximizes my chances of increasing my score without immediate risks.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

(5, 8): The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |8-3| = 9.\n2. (6, 1): The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |1-3| = 7.\n3. (0, 2): The Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |2-3| = 2.\n4. (3, 8): The Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |8-3| = 7.\n5. (8, 6): The Manhattan distance is |8-1| + |6-3| = 10.\n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is the closest, with a distance of 2. Given its proximity and the absence of obstacles in that direction, it is the most strategic choice.\n\n### Enemy Snake\nSnake #2 is located at (3, 9) with no body following it. It will not interfere with my immediate movement path to (0, 2), as it's far away from my snake's current position.\n\n### Movement Options\nFrom my current position (1, 3), I can move in the following directions:\n- **UP (to 1, 4):** Keeps me on a generally safe path.\n- **LEFT (to 0, 3):** Moves me directly towards the apple at (0, 2).\n- **DOWN or RIGHT:** These directions take me away from the nearest apple and are not strategic.\n\n### Decision\nSince moving LEFT (to 0, 3) aligns with the goal of reaching the nearest apple at (0, 2) quickly and safely, this move maximizes my chances of increasing my score without immediate risks.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"
