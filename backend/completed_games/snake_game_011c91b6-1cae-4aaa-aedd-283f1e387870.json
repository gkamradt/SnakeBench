I see that there's an apple at (1, 0) which is quite close, and another one at (8, 3) which is a bit further away.\n\nMy current position is in the middle of the board, and I don't have any immediate threats from other snakes. However, I do need to be careful not to run into the wall or myself.\n\nConsidering my options, I think I'll try to move towards the apple at (1, 0). This will give me a chance to grow and gain some points.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards the apple at (1, 0) and see if I can grab it.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Therefore, the enemy snake does not pose an immediate threat.\n\nThe snake should move LEFT to get the apple at (0, 2).\n\nNext turn strategy: After getting the apple, the snake should move towards the apple at (2, 7) as it is the next closest apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT\n\n--End of your move information.--"
