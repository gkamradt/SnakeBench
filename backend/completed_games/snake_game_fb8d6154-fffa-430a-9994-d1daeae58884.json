Prioritize eating the closest apples to gain points.\n2. Avoid getting too close to the enemy snake or trapping myself.\n3. Try to maintain a central position on the board for better maneuverability.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

I see a few apples nearby, but I also need to be careful not to run into the other snake or the wall.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to get closer to one of the apples, but not too close. I don't want to risk running into the other snake or the wall. I'll try to position myself to get a good shot at an apple on the next turn.\n\nI'm thinking of moving... RIGHT. This will bring me closer to the apple at (3, 9) and give me a good chance to grab it on the next turn."
