After consuming this apple, my body will lengthen, which adds a point and aligns with the game objective.\n\n2. **Evaluating Threats**:\n   - Snake #2's head is at (7, 7) with its body at (6, 7). This snake does not immediately threaten my movements since it is located to the right and lower end of my position. The assumption is that the enemy snake might continue right or change its course, but it is distant enough that I have an immediate safe path to the apple at (4, 9).\n\n3. **Future Path Consideration**:\n   - After consuming the apple at (4, 9), I need to plan the subsequent moves based on my increased length, the positions of other apples, and possible enemy movements. Options would involve potential moves towards another apple at (2, 6) or planning a route to (2, 2), while keeping a vigilant watch on how Snake #2 moves.\n\n4. **Movement Strategy**:\n   - Continuing vertically up is currently the best option to secure another apple without compromising safety. After reaching (4, 9), re-evaluating the position and ensuring there's a clear path without risks of running into walls or other snakes will be essential.\n   - The subsequent move might need to involve either moving rightward towards upcoming apples or preparing to tactically shift left as safer paths emerge based on enemy movements.\n\nWith this analysis, the decision to move UP is still the safest and most fruitful one ensuring continued growth while keeping a safe position relative to the board constraints and enemy snake.\n\n**Next Move:** UP"

This secures 1 point and increases my snake's length, improving the score but also potentially restricting mobility if not carefully managed.\n\n2. **Assessing Future Apple Targets**:\n   - The closest apples post-consumption will be at (2, 6) and (2, 2) towards the left side and (4, 5) one block directly below my newly positioned body. These present viable targets for continued growth and point accumulation.\n   - The apple at (4, 5) becomes an immediate next target since moving down does not currently pose a threat from walls or other snakes.\n\n3. **Monitoring Enemy Snake Movements**:\n   - The enemy snake (#2) located at (7, 8) with its body at [(7, 7)] poses a distant threat. Watching its movement will be crucial as closing gaps between us will change retreat or attack strategies.\n\n4. **Tactical Re-positioning**:\n   - Upon eating the apple and moving downward, I should aim for a flexible navigation strategy to either move towards the left for the apples at (2, 6) and (2, 2) or secure the southwest quadrant free from enemy interference.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Hazard**:\n   - Continuous monitoring is needed to avoid trapping myself against walls or getting too close to the enemy snake, mindful of wall boundaries and growing snake body.\n\n**Next Move Strategy**: \n   - After moving UP to (4, 9) and consuming the apple, consider moving DOWN toward the apple at (4, 5) for the subsequent turn as long as it remains safe, reevaluating enemy position and other apple availability right after.\n\n**Next Move**: UP"
