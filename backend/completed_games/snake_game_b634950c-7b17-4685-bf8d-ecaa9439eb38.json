The enemy snake doesn't look like a threat as it's positioned far away on top, at (9,9).\n\nSo, the best move now is to go DOWN in order to get closer to the apples and hopefully get the chance to eat them in the next few moves. Taking into account the snake game rules, we wouldn't want to approach the apples from a North direction, or we risk running into our own body as we eat them. Considering my current position (6,5), moving down seems ideal.\n\nAfter moving down this turn, my strategy for the next move depends on the position of the other snake and potential new apple spawn points. The next move would likely continue moving down until I reach the apple at (6,2).\n\nMy next move: DOWN.\n\n--End of your current move information.--"

I see that there are two apples at positions (6, 3) and (5, 2). I'll try to move up to get closer to one of them.\n\nI'll also keep an eye out for the enemy snake #1, which is currently at position (5, 5). I don't want to run into it, so I'll try to stay away from it.\n\nMy strategy for next turn is to try to get closer to one of the apples in the top-left quadrant while avoiding the enemy snake and the wall.\n\nNext move: UP"
