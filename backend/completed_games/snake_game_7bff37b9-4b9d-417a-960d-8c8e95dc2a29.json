            "rationale": "Current situation:\n- I successfully moved LEFT to (6, 3), giving myself more room to maneuver.\n- My body segment is now at (7, 3).\n- The nearest apple is down and to the right at (7, 2).\n- The enemy snake is still far away at (2, 8).\n\nStrategy:\n1. To reach the apple at (7, 2), I should move RIGHT to (7, 3), then DOWN to (7, 2).\n2. After eating the apple, I will need to decide on my next target and plan my route accordingly.\n3. I must continue to avoid colliding with my own growing body and the board edges.\n4. The enemy snake's position should be monitored, but it is not an immediate threat.\n\nThinking ahead:\n- After reaching the apple at (7, 2), I will have two options for my next target: (3, 1) or (9, 1).\n- The apple at (3, 1) is closer, but navigating to it may be more challenging due to my growing body.\n- The apple at (9, 1) is farther away, but the path to it seems more open and less risky.\n- I will need to assess the situation after eating the apple at (7, 2) and choose my next target based on the current board state and enemy snake's position.\n\nReminder for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (7, 3), move DOWN to (7, 2) to eat the apple. Then, carefully consider the positions of the remaining apples and plan my route to the next target while avoiding collision with my own body, the board edges, and the enemy snake.\n\nMy move this turn: RIGHT"
