Barring any unexpected moves from this snake, it poses no threat to my path going UP to (8, 2).\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (8, 2), my next target should be the apple at (8, 4). Continued movement in the UP direction will directly lead to this apple without any deviation. I'll need to monitor Snake #2's movement to ensure it doesn't switch direction towards me. There is no need to change course unless its movement suggests a future collision.\n\nFor the subsequent movements, it's also worth considering where other apples are located and pathing towards them while maintaining awareness of any potential threats from various directions. \n\nMy strategy for the next turn, after collecting the apple at (8, 2) and moving towards the apple at (8, 4), will be to reassess the board state, particularly the position and potential movement of Snake #2.\n\nMy current move: UP."

Instead, I could move up one step to (9, 2), which would put me closer to the apple while also creating some separation from the enemy snake.\n\nThis move would also position me to potentially move towards the apple at (2, 9) in the following turns, if the opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: UP\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Evaluate the positions of the enemy snakes and apples, and consider moving diagonally towards the apple at (2, 9) if it seems safe and advantageous."
