This move positions my snake closer to the apple at (3, 4) while maintaining safety.  \n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving to (3, 1), I will reassess the positions of the remaining apples and plan the next move accordingly, focusing on reaching the next nearest apple efficiently while avoiding enemy snakes and walls.  \n\n---\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"
