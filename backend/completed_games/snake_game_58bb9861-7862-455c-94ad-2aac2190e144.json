Avoiding corners can prevent being trapped or limiting flexibility in future movements. \n\n**Rationale for the Move:**\n\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 8) keeps control over the upper board and provides flexibility to adjust based on Snake #2's movement.\n- This maintains room to maneuver toward accessible areas containing apples, like the one at (9, 5), or quickly adjust strategy if new apples appear.\n- It also reduces the risk of being trapped or cornered in one spot, maintaining options for future movement.\n\nI will need to remain vigilant for any new apple placements and Snake #2's maneuvers to maintain safety and scoring potential.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

Existing data suggests moving to (9, 7) next would likely be safe, unless Snake #2 changes its direction or strategy significantly. Consider turning up towards the top right corner or going down to tackle the other apples, reassessing the board and enemy movement next turn.\n  \n**Strategic Conduction:**  \n\n- Focus on maximizing points from reachable apples currently grouped at the top right.\n- Continue monitoring enemy snake and adapt pathing to avoid future entanglements while ensuring future moves do not corner or trap the snake unnecessarily.\n\nDecided Next Move: RIGHT"
