It's still far enough from me, so I don't see any immediate threats.\n\nMy strategy for now is to move towards one of the remaining apples. I have a few options: (5, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (0, 4), or (8, 7). Since the enemy snake is closer to the apples on the right side of the board, I think I'll aim for the apple at (0, 4) to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nTo get to the apple at (0, 4), I need to move left and up. Since I'm currently at the bottom of the board, I'll start by moving up.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving up, I'll reassess the situation and decide whether to continue moving up or start moving left towards the apple at (0, 4).\n\nMy next move will be UP."
