The quickest path for collection is straightforward:\n\n1. **Strategy for Immediate Move:** Moving UP from (8, 7) takes us directly to (8, 8). Following this move with another UP next turn will lead us directly to the apple at (8, 9). This will ensure capturing the apple efficiently with minimal movement.\n\n2. **Avoiding Potential Risks:** It is crucial to keep a distance from the enemy snake positioned at (6, 4). Although there's no indication of the enemy snake growing, staying on the upper side of the board while it potentially occupies the middle to lower sections minimizes risk.\n\n3. **Planning Subsequent Moves:** After collecting the apple at (8, 9), planning a descent towards the central apple at (3, 6) or the farther one at (0, 6) can be assessed based on the enemy snake\u2019s position and movements. It's important to keep our trail flexible for abrupt change in plans if the enemy snake decides to ascend towards the top rows.\n\n**Future Strategy Thoughts:**\n- After collecting the apple at (8, 9) by moving UP twice, assess the situation. If safe, a sequential movement strategy should be made towards the central area of the board or all the way to the left to avoid unnecessary confrontation and to collect additional apples.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement pattern to foresee any potential threats or clashes.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP\n\nMoving UP will allow me to collect the apple at (8, 9) next turn, maximizing point gains with minimal risk.

My strategic focus should now be on collecting this apple before navigating towards others. The quickest path for collection is straightforward:\n\n1. **Strategy for Immediate Move:** Moving UP from (8, 7) takes us directly to (8, 8). Following this move with another UP next turn will lead us directly to the apple at (8, 9). This will ensure capturing the apple efficiently with minimal movement.\n\n2. **Avoiding Potential Risks:** It is crucial to keep a distance from the enemy snake positioned at (6, 4). Although there's no indication of the enemy snake growing, staying on the upper side of the board while it potentially occupies the middle to lower sections minimizes risk.\n\n3. **Planning Subsequent Moves:** After collecting the apple at (8, 9), planning a descent towards the central apple at (3, 6) or the farther one at (0, 6) can be assessed based on the enemy snake\u2019s position and movements. It's important to keep our trail flexible for abrupt change in plans if the enemy snake decides to ascend towards the top rows.\n\n**Future Strategy Thoughts:**\n- After collecting the apple at (8, 9) by moving UP twice, assess the situation. If safe, a sequential movement strategy should be made towards the central area of the board or all the way to the left to avoid unnecessary confrontation and to collect additional apples.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement pattern to foresee any potential threats or clashes.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP\n\nMoving UP will allow me to collect the apple at (8, 9) next turn, maximizing point gains with minimal risk. Post that, decisions can be adjusted based on the board state and enemy's position."

Since I'm at (8, 9), the quickest route avoids any backtracking or unnecessary exposure to the center area where Snake #2 may predict my path.\n\n2. Constant watch on Snake #2's movements. Keeping a mental note of whether it trends upwards towards the apples or remains near its current area will help me make safer route choices.\n\n3. Plan future movements for reach and flexibility. Maneuver such that subsequent moves aren't predictable and keep exit paths open to shift directions abruptly if needed.\n\n**Strategy Thoughts for the Future:**\n- Now that an apple is collected at (8, 9), plan a course for the apple at (3, 6).\n- Contemplate using a mix of left and down movements avoiding any direct interaction with Snake #2.\n- Keep in mind the edge boundaries, and adjust course early to avoid hitting the wall or retracing paths.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT\n\nMoving LEFT will start my horizontal shift across the board.

The quickest path for collection is straightforward:\n\n1. **Strategy for Immediate Move:** Moving UP from (8, 7) takes us directly to (8, 8). Following this move with another UP next turn will lead us directly to the apple at (8, 9). This will ensure capturing the apple efficiently with minimal movement.\n\n2. **Avoiding Potential Risks:** It is crucial to keep a distance from the enemy snake positioned at (6, 4). Although there's no indication of the enemy snake growing, staying on the upper side of the board while it potentially occupies the middle to lower sections minimizes risk.\n\n3. **Planning Subsequent Moves:** After collecting the apple at (8, 9), planning a descent towards the central apple at (3, 6) or the farther one at (0, 6) can be assessed based on the enemy snake\u2019s position and movements. It's important to keep our trail flexible for abrupt change in plans if the enemy snake decides to ascend towards the top rows.\n\n**Future Strategy Thoughts:**\n- After collecting the apple at (8, 9) by moving UP twice, assess the situation.

This is the most logical step to collect the nearest resource efficiently.\n\n2. **Post-Apple Collection Strategy:** After grabbing the apple at (8, 9), I should then evaluate the positions of the remaining apples and the enemy snake. Noting the positions of the apples at (0, 6), (0, 2), (5, 0), and (3, 6), a possible course of action could be to travel downwards or horizontally across the higher rows to eventually make a way to another apple, such as the one at (3, 6).\n\n3. **Monitoring Enemy Snake:** It's crucial that I pay attention to the movements of the enemy snake. Although it currently lacks length and immediate threat, its strategic moves towards the apples or its placement towards my location could require adjustments to my strategy.\n\n4. **Long-Term Strategy:** Farming upper row apples and maintaining a distance from my opponent will provide a sustainable advantage.
