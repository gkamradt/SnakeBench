Moving down to (3, 0) would allow me to eat the apple and gain a point. This is a safe move as it avoids the enemy snake and the walls.\n\nThe next closest apple is at (0, 2), which is to the left and down from my current position. However, this move would put me closer to the enemy snake, so it's not as ideal as the move to (3, 0).\n\nThere are also apples at (8, 2), (0, 5), and (5, 2), but they are further away from my current position, so I won't focus on them for now.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move DOWN to (3, 0) to eat the apple and gain a point. This also puts me in a better position to potentially reach the other apples on the board.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
