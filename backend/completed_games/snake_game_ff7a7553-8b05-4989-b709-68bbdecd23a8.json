The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (7,5) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that (5,8) is where I am. The apples around me are at (4,8) and (7,8). Since I'm at (5,8), moving left would take me to (4,8), which is an apple. That seems like a good option because I can grow and gain a point. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause me to run into any walls or other snakes.\n\nWait, moving left from (5,8) would take me to (4,8). Is that a valid move? Yes, because (4,8) is within the board's boundaries. Also, there's no snake there except for me potentially. Since the enemy snake is at (7,5), which is far away, I don't think I'll collide with it. Also, I don't have any body segments that would block me from moving left, right? Because my body is just the head at (5,8) since I'm a single segment snake.\n\nSo, moving left to (4,8) would let me eat the apple and grow. That seems like a good move. Alternatively, moving right would take me to (6,8), but there's no apple there, so that's less rewarding. Moving up would take me to (5,9), which is outside the board, so that's invalid. Moving down would take me to (5,7), which is also empty, but no apple.\n\nSo, the best immediate move is to go left to (4,8) to eat the apple. That gives me a point and makes me longer. I should also consider if the enemy snake is a threat. Since it's at (7,5), it's not near me, so I don't need to worry about it right now. My main goal is to collect apples, so taking the one at (4,8) is the priority.\n\nI think I'm safe to move left. No walls, no snakes in that direction, and it's an apple.
