Choosing UP brings me to (4,4) immediately moving me closer in the vertical direction, and then I can shift left in subsequent moves to reach the apple.\n\nThus, my immediate best move is to head UP.\n\nNext move: UP."
          },
          "2": {
            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,7) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). The enemy snake is at (4,3). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. The closest ones are (7,7) and (8,6). Wait, (7,7) is right next to me. My current position is (9,7). So moving left twice would get me to (7,7). But wait, moving left once would take me to (8,7), then left again to (7,7). That's two moves. But since each move is one step, maybe I can reach it in two moves. But right now, I can only choose the next direction. So from (9,7), possible moves are left, down, or up. Wait, moving up would take me to (9,8), which is empty. Moving down to (9,6), which is also empty. But the apple at (7,7) is two steps left and same y. So if I go left first, then next turn I can go left again to reach (7,7). But maybe there's a better option.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). From (9,7), moving down would take me to (9,6), then left to (8,6). That's two steps as well. So both apples are two steps away. Which one is safer? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,3), which is far away. So maybe both paths are safe. But I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (9,7) is okay, but moving left again would be (8,7), then (7,7). Wait, no. Wait, starting at (9,7), moving left once would be (8,7). Then next move left again to (7,7). So that's two moves. But the apple is at (7,7), so that's the target. Alternatively, moving down to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get that apple. Both apples are two steps away. Which path is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider possible collisions. Since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is not near either path. So maybe both are safe. But maybe the apple at (7,7) is closer. Let me check the coordinates again. The snake is at (9,7). The apple at (7,7) is two steps left. The apple at (8,6) is one step left and one step down. So both require two moves. But which one is more efficient? Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows. So after eating, the next move would have a body part. But since the body is empty now, after eating, the body would be the previous position. So if I go for (7,7), after moving left twice, I would have a body part at (9,7) and (8,7). But since the body is empty now, maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,6) would require moving down first. From (9,7) to (9,6) (DOWN), then LEFT to (8,6). That would get the apple there. Then the body would be at (9,7) and (9,6). Hmm. Both options seem okay. But maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so moving left twice. But wait, after the first move left to (8,7), the next move left to (7,7) would get the apple. Then the snake's body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ] after that. But since the body is empty now, after eating the apple, the body would grow by one. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (7,7), the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, no. Let me think. Normally, when a snake moves, each segment follows the head. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So if the snake is just the head (body is empty), moving to (8,7) would make the body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) would make the body [ (8,7) ], but if you eat an apple there, then the body would become [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves first. If there's no apple, the tail moves forward. If there is an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. Since currently, the snake's body is empty. So when the snake moves to (8,7), the body becomes [ (9,7) ]. Then, if the next move is to (7,7) and that's an apple, then the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because the tail doesn't move. So after eating the apple, the body grows. So in two moves, the snake would have a body of two segments. That's okay. But the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. So no immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, going for the (8,6) apple. First move DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6). That would also get an apple. Then the body would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ] after eating. Which path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. Moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) is safe. Then left again to (7,7) is safe. The enemy is at (4,3), so no collision there. Similarly, moving down to (9,6) is safe, then left to (8,6) is safe. Both paths seem okay.\n\nAnother consideration: after getting the apple, where to go next. If I take (7,7), then the next apples are (2,4), (0,6), (1,0). But maybe after that, moving towards (8,6) would be possible. Alternatively, after (8,6), maybe go towards (0,6) or (2,4). But perhaps the (7,7) apple is closer. Let me check the distances. From (9,7) to (7,7): two steps left. From (9,7) to (8,6): one down, one left. Both same distance. So either is fine. But maybe (7,7) is better because it's in the same row, so less direction changes. But maybe (8,6) is better because after that, moving towards (0,6) or (1,0) could be a path. Alternatively, after (7,7), moving down to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) or other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,6) is better because after eating it, the next move could be to (8,5) or (7,6), which might lead towards other apples. But I'm not sure. Let's think about possible paths. If I go for (7,7), then after that, the snake is at (7,7) with body [ (8,7), (9,7) ]. Then possible moves from there: left to (6,7), right to (8,7) (but that's the body), up to (7,8), or down to (7,6). So moving left to (6,7) would be safe. Then maybe towards (2,4) or other apples. Alternatively, moving down to (7,6) could lead towards (8,6) if that's still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then after that, the snake is at (8,6) with body [ (9,6), (9,7) ]. Then possible moves: left to (7,6), right to (9,6) (body), up to (8,7) (body?), wait, no. Wait, the body after eating (8,6) would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because the first move was down to (9,6), then left to (8,6). So the body would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because when you move down to (9,6), the body is [ (9,7) ]. Then moving left to (8,6) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move down from (9,7) to (9,6), the body becomes [ (9,7) ]. Then, when you move left to (8,6) and eat the apple there, the body grows by one, so the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because the tail doesn't move. So the body is the previous positions. So after two moves, the body is [ (9,7), (9,6) ] and the head is at (8,6). So from there, possible moves: left to (7,6), up to (8,7), down to (8,5), or right to (9,6) (which is part of the body). So moving left to (7,6) would be safe. Then maybe towards (2,4) or other apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,7), then after two moves, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ] and head at (7,7). Then possible moves: left to (6,7), up to (7,8), down to (7,6). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (4,3). Are they moving towards any apples? The apples at (2,4) is near them. So maybe they will go for that. But since they are at (4,3), moving up to (4,4) would get them closer to (2,4). But that's not directly. Maybe they'll move left and up. But I don't know their direction. But since they are far away, maybe it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, which direction to choose first? Let's see. If I go for (7,7), the first move is LEFT. If I go for (8,6), the first move is DOWN. So which is better? Let's check possible dangers. Moving LEFT to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe. Both are valid. But maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so less direction changes. Alternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after that, moving left towards (7,6) and then towards other apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,6) is too far, but the one at (1,0) is even further. So probably best to go for the closest apples first.\n\nAnother thought: after moving LEFT to (8,7), the next move would be LEFT again to (7,7) to get the apple. Then, the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, from (7,7), possible moves: left to (6,7), up to (7,8), down to (7,6). Let's say I go left again towards (6,7), then maybe towards (2,4). But that's a longer path. Alternatively, after (7,7), moving down to (7,6) could lead towards (8,6) if it's still there, but if I already took (7,7), then (8,6) is still there. Wait, but in the current state, the apples are at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). So if I take (7,7), that apple is gone. But the apple at (8,6) is still there. So after taking (7,7), maybe I can go down to (7,6) and then left to (6,6), etc. But maybe it's better to take (8,6) first, then (7,7) if possible. Wait, but (7,7) is an apple now. So if I take (7,7) first, then (8,6) is still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe taking (7,7) first is better because it's in the same row, and then I can go down to (7,6) and left towards (8,6). Wait, no. From (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then right to (8,6) would get that apple. But that's two moves. Alternatively, from (8,6), moving up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7) would get that apple, but that's also two moves. So maybe it's better to take the closest ones first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after taking it, the next move could be up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7). But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. Wait, but when I take an apple, does it disappear and reappear elsewhere? The problem statement says it's a multi-apple game, but I'm not sure if apples respawn. The initial apples are listed, so maybe they are fixed. So if I take (7,7), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples would be (2,4), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). So taking (7,7) first removes that apple. Taking (8,6) first removes that one. So maybe it's better to take both if possible. But since I can only take one at a time, I need to choose which to prioritize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after taking it, I can move towards (0,6) which is in the same column. From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), etc., towards (0,6). But that's a long path. Alternatively, after taking (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6), etc. But again, long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (1,0) apple is too far, so not worth considering now. The (2,4) apple is in the middle. So after taking either (7,7) or (8,6), the next target could be (2,4). But that's a longer path.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to go for the closest apple first. Both (7,7) and (8,6) are two steps away. So which one is safer? Let's check the paths again. Moving LEFT to (8,7) is safe. Then LEFT again to (7,7) to get the apple. That path is safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6) to get that apple. Both paths are safe. So either direction is okay. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a straight line. Alternatively, moving DOWN first might lead to more options. Let me think about the board layout. The apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. The snake is at (9,7). Moving down to (9,6) and then left to (8,6) would get that apple. Then, from (8,6), possible moves: left to (7,6), up to (8,7), down to (8,5). If I go left to (7,6), then maybe towards (7,7) if it's still there. But if I took (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe that's a better path. Alternatively, if I take (7,7) first, then from there, moving down to (7,6) and then right to (8,6) to get that apple. But that would require two moves again. So maybe taking (8,6) first allows me to then go up to (8,7) and left to (7,7) to get that apple. But wait, after taking (8,6), the next move could be up to (8,7), which is adjacent to (7,7). Then moving left to (7,7) would get that apple. So that's two moves again. So either path allows taking both apples in four moves. But since apples are fixed, maybe it's better to take whichever is closer first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so the path is straightforward. Let's choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move LEFT again to get (7,7). That way, I get the apple quickly and then can plan the next move. So first move: LEFT to (8,7). Then next move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That seems good. So the first move should be LEFT.\n\nBut wait, the current position is (9,7). Moving LEFT would take me to (8,7). Then next move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. Then the next move would be LEFT again. But since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. So this path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN first to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6) to eat that apple. Then next move could be UP to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7) to eat that apple. So that's also possible. But which path is shorter? Both require two moves to get the first apple. So it's a matter of which apple to take first. But since both are equally distant, maybe the (7,7) apple is better because after eating it, the next move can be down to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) if needed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after eating it, the snake can move up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7), but that would require the (7,7) apple to still be there. However, if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe that's a better strategy. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother consideration: the snake's body. After eating an apple, the body grows. So after taking (7,7), the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then moving left to (6,7) would leave the body at (8,7) and (9,7). Wait, no. Let me think again. When you eat an apple, the next move the body grows. So when you move to (7,7) and eat the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, the next move, when you move left to (6,7), the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ]. So the tail moves forward. Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the body grows by one. So the next move after eating, the tail doesn't move. So after eating (7,7), the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, moving left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ] because the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. Let me clarify the movement. Normally, each time the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. So if the snake is just the head (body empty), moving to (8,7) makes the body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, the next move, when you move left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The apple is eaten when you move into it. So after moving into (7,7), you eat the apple, so the next move, when you move again, the body grows. So the body after eating the apple would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, when you move left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail stays, so the total length increases by one. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.\n\nInitial state: head at (9,7), body empty.\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,7). Body becomes [ (9,7) ].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,7) and eat the apple. Because you ate an apple, the body grows by one. So the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ].\n\nMove 3: You move LEFT to (6,7). The body segments follow: the first body part moves to (8,7) -> (7,7), and the second part moves to (9,7) -> (8,7). Wait, no. The body follows the head. So when the head moves to (6,7), the body segments move to the previous positions of the head. So after move 3, the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you ate an apple in move 2, the body length increased by one. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you didn't eat an apple in move 3, the tail (last segment) is removed. Wait, no. When you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. So after move 3, the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you didn't eat an apple, the tail (oldest segment) is removed. Wait, no. The body grows when you eat an apple. So normally, each move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the body grows by one (the tail doesn't move). So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and since no apple was eaten, the tail (9,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (7,7) -> (6,7). The body segments follow: the first body part moves to where the head was (7,7), and the second moves to where the first was (8,7). But since no apple was eaten, the tail (last segment) is removed. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it as the body segments follow the head's path. So each time the head moves, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it. So if the body is [A, B], and the head moves to C, then the new body is [B, C's previous position]. Wait, no. Let's take an example.\n\nHead at (7,7), body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ].\n\nWait, no. After move 2, the head is at (7,7), and the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because when you ate the apple, the body grows. So the body is the previous positions of the head. So after move 1: head at (8,7), body [ (9,7) ].\n\nMove 2: head moves to (7,7), body becomes [ (8,7) ] and then because you ate an apple, the body grows by one, so it's [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, the body length increases by one. So normally, when you move, the body is the previous positions of the head. So if you have a body length of 0, moving to (8,7) gives body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) and eating an apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because you add a new segment. So the body length is now 2. Then, when you move again, the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail (oldest segment, (9,7)) is removed only if you didn't eat an apple. Wait, no. The tail is only removed if you don't eat an apple. So when you eat an apple, the tail stays, increasing the body length. When you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), no apple. So the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail (9,7) is removed. So the body is now [ (8,7), (7,7) ), length 2. So the snake's body is two segments long. \n\nThis is getting complicated, but I think the main point is that taking either apple is safe, and both require two moves. So the first move should be either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after taking (7,7), the next move could be down to (7,6), which is closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, no. (7,6) is not an apple. The apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). So from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then right to (8,6) would get that apple. That's two moves. But if I take (8,6) first, then from there, moving up to (8,7), then left to (7,7) would get that apple. So either way, both apples can be taken in four moves. \n\nBut since I have to choose the first move now, I need to decide between LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,3). Are they a threat? Probably not immediately, but maybe they are heading towards (2,4). But since they are far away, I don't need to worry about them yet. \n\nSo, which direction to choose? Maybe LEFT is better because it's a straight path towards (7,7), and after that, I can maneuver towards other apples. Alternatively, DOWN to (9,6) then LEFT to (8,6) is also good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,6) is better because after eating it, I can move up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7), but that would require that apple to still be there. However, since the apples are fixed (they don't respawn), once I eat one, it's gone. So if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So I can go for (7,7) next. \n\nBut if I take (7,7) first, then (8,6) is still there. So either way, I can get both apples. \n\nBut perhaps the (7,7) apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, both are two steps away. So it's a tie. \n\nAnother thought: moving LEFT first to (8,7) keeps me in the same row, which might be easier to navigate. Moving DOWN to (9,6) takes me to a different row, which might complicate future moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) and then LEFT to (8,6) gives me an apple, and then I can move UP to (8,7) and LEFT to (7,7) for another apple. That's four moves total. \n\nBut since I can only plan one move at a time, the first move is critical. \n\nI think I'll go with LEFT to (8,7) to head towards the (7,7) apple. That seems straightforward and safe. Then next move can be LEFT again to get the apple. \n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \n**Next Move:** LEFT  \n**Rationale:** The closest apple is at (7,7), two steps left from the current position (9,7). Moving LEFT first to (8,7) sets up a direct path to consume the apple next turn. This path avoids immediate threats and prioritizes growth efficiently."

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,7) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). The enemy snake is at (4,3). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. The closest ones are (7,7) and (8,6). Wait, (7,7) is right next to me. My current position is (9,7). So moving left twice would get me to (7,7). But wait, moving left once would take me to (8,7), then left again to (7,7). That's two moves. But since each move is one step, maybe I can reach it in two moves. But right now, I can only choose the next direction. So from (9,7), possible moves are left, down, or up. Wait, moving up would take me to (9,8), which is empty. Moving down to (9,6), which is also empty. But the apple at (7,7) is two steps left and same y. So if I go left first, then next turn I can go left again to reach (7,7). But maybe there's a better option.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). From (9,7), moving down would take me to (9,6), then left to (8,6). That's two steps as well. So both apples are two steps away. Which one is safer? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,3), which is far away. So maybe both paths are safe. But I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (9,7) is okay, but moving left again would be (8,7), then (7,7). Wait, no. Wait, starting at (9,7), moving left once would be (8,7). Then next move left again to (7,7). So that's two moves. But the apple is at (7,7), so that's the target. Alternatively, moving down to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get that apple. Both apples are two steps away. Which path is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider possible collisions. Since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is not near either path. So maybe both are safe. But maybe the apple at (7,7) is closer. Let me check the coordinates again. The snake is at (9,7). The apple at (7,7) is two steps left. The apple at (8,6) is one step left and one step down. So both require two moves. But which one is more efficient? Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows. So after eating, the next move would have a body part. But since the body is empty now, after eating, the body would be the previous position. So if I go for (7,7), after moving left twice, I would have a body part at (9,7) and (8,7). But since the body is empty now, maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,6) would require moving down first. From (9,7) to (9,6) (DOWN), then LEFT to (8,6). That would get the apple there. Then the body would be at (9,7) and (9,6). Hmm. Both options seem okay. But maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so moving left twice. But wait, after the first move left to (8,7), the next move left to (7,7) would get the apple. Then the snake's body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ] after that. But since the body is empty now, after eating the apple, the body would grow by one. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (7,7), the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, no. Let me think. Normally, when a snake moves, each segment follows the head. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So if the snake is just the head (body is empty), moving to (8,7) would make the body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) would make the body [ (8,7) ], but if you eat an apple there, then the body would become [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves first. If there's no apple, the tail moves forward. If there is an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. Since currently, the snake's body is empty. So when the snake moves to (8,7), the body becomes [ (9,7) ]. Then, if the next move is to (7,7) and that's an apple, then the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because the tail doesn't move. So after eating the apple, the body grows. So in two moves, the snake would have a body of two segments. That's okay. But the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. So no immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, going for the (8,6) apple. First move DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6). That would also get an apple. Then the body would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ] after eating. Which path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. Moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) is safe. Then left again to (7,7) is safe. The enemy is at (4,3), so no collision there. Similarly, moving down to (9,6) is safe, then left to (8,6) is safe. Both paths seem okay.\n\nAnother consideration: after getting the apple, where to go next. If I take (7,7), then the next apples are (2,4), (0,6), (1,0). But maybe after that, moving towards (8,6) would be possible. Alternatively, after (8,6), maybe go towards (0,6) or (2,4). But perhaps the (7,7) apple is closer. Let me check the distances. From (9,7) to (7,7): two steps left. From (9,7) to (8,6): one down, one left. Both same distance. So either is fine. But maybe (7,7) is better because it's in the same row, so less direction changes. But maybe (8,6) is better because after that, moving towards (0,6) or (1,0) could be a path. Alternatively, after (7,7), moving down to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) or other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,6) is better because after eating it, the next move could be to (8,5) or (7,6), which might lead towards other apples. But I'm not sure. Let's think about possible paths. If I go for (7,7), then after that, the snake is at (7,7) with body [ (8,7), (9,7) ]. Then possible moves from there: left to (6,7), right to (8,7) (but that's the body), up to (7,8), or down to (7,6). So moving left to (6,7) would be safe. Then maybe towards (2,4) or other apples. Alternatively, moving down to (7,6) could lead towards (8,6) if that's still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then after that, the snake is at (8,6) with body [ (9,6), (9,7) ]. Then possible moves: left to (7,6), right to (9,6) (body), up to (8,7) (body?), wait, no. Wait, the body after eating (8,6) would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because the first move was down to (9,6), then left to (8,6). So the body would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because when you move down to (9,6), the body is [ (9,7) ]. Then moving left to (8,6) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move down from (9,7) to (9,6), the body becomes [ (9,7) ]. Then, when you move left to (8,6) and eat the apple there, the body grows by one, so the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because the tail doesn't move. So the body is the previous positions. So after two moves, the body is [ (9,7), (9,6) ] and the head is at (8,6). So from there, possible moves: left to (7,6), up to (8,7), down to (8,5), or right to (9,6) (which is part of the body). So moving left to (7,6) would be safe. Then maybe towards (2,4) or other apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,7), then after two moves, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ] and head at (7,7). Then possible moves: left to (6,7), up to (7,8), down to (7,6). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (4,3). Are they moving towards any apples? The apples at (2,4) is near them. So maybe they will go for that. But since they are at (4,3), moving up to (4,4) would get them closer to (2,4). But that's not directly. Maybe they'll move left and up. But I don't know their direction. But since they are far away, maybe it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, which direction to choose first? Let's see. If I go for (7,7), the first move is LEFT. If I go for (8,6), the first move is DOWN. So which is better? Let's check possible dangers. Moving LEFT to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe. Both are valid. But maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so less direction changes. Alternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after that, moving left towards (7,6) and then towards other apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,6) is too far, but the one at (1,0) is even further. So probably best to go for the closest apples first.\n\nAnother thought: after moving LEFT to (8,7), the next move would be LEFT again to (7,7) to get the apple. Then, the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, from (7,7), possible moves: left to (6,7), up to (7,8), down to (7,6). Let's say I go left again towards (6,7), then maybe towards (2,4). But that's a longer path. Alternatively, after (7,7), moving down to (7,6) could lead towards (8,6) if it's still there, but if I already took (7,7), then (8,6) is still there. Wait, but in the current state, the apples are at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). So if I take (7,7), that apple is gone. But the apple at (8,6) is still there. So after taking (7,7), maybe I can go down to (7,6) and then left to (6,6), etc. But maybe it's better to take (8,6) first, then (7,7) if possible. Wait, but (7,7) is an apple now. So if I take (7,7) first, then (8,6) is still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe taking (7,7) first is better because it's in the same row, and then I can go down to (7,6) and left towards (8,6). Wait, no. From (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then right to (8,6) would get that apple. But that's two moves. Alternatively, from (8,6), moving up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7) would get that apple, but that's also two moves. So maybe it's better to take the closest ones first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after taking it, the next move could be up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7). But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. Wait, but when I take an apple, does it disappear and reappear elsewhere? The problem statement says it's a multi-apple game, but I'm not sure if apples respawn. The initial apples are listed, so maybe they are fixed. So if I take (7,7), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples would be (2,4), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). So taking (7,7) first removes that apple. Taking (8,6) first removes that one. So maybe it's better to take both if possible. But since I can only take one at a time, I need to choose which to prioritize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after taking it, I can move towards (0,6) which is in the same column. From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), etc., towards (0,6). But that's a long path. Alternatively, after taking (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6), etc. But again, long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (1,0) apple is too far, so not worth considering now. The (2,4) apple is in the middle. So after taking either (7,7) or (8,6), the next target could be (2,4). But that's a longer path.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to go for the closest apple first. Both (7,7) and (8,6) are two steps away. So which one is safer? Let's check the paths again. Moving LEFT to (8,7) is safe. Then LEFT again to (7,7) to get the apple. That path is safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6) to get that apple. Both paths are safe. So either direction is okay. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a straight line. Alternatively, moving DOWN first might lead to more options. Let me think about the board layout. The apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. The snake is at (9,7). Moving down to (9,6) and then left to (8,6) would get that apple. Then, from (8,6), possible moves: left to (7,6), up to (8,7), down to (8,5). If I go left to (7,6), then maybe towards (7,7) if it's still there. But if I took (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe that's a better path. Alternatively, if I take (7,7) first, then from there, moving down to (7,6) and then right to (8,6) to get that apple. But that would require two moves again. So maybe taking (8,6) first allows me to then go up to (8,7) and left to (7,7) to get that apple. But wait, after taking (8,6), the next move could be up to (8,7), which is adjacent to (7,7). Then moving left to (7,7) would get that apple. So that's two moves again. So either path allows taking both apples in four moves. But since apples are fixed, maybe it's better to take whichever is closer first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so the path is straightforward. Let's choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move LEFT again to get (7,7). That way, I get the apple quickly and then can plan the next move. So first move: LEFT to (8,7). Then next move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That seems good. So the first move should be LEFT.\n\nBut wait, the current position is (9,7). Moving LEFT would take me to (8,7). Then next move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. Then the next move would be LEFT again. But since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. So this path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN first to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6) to eat that apple. Then next move could be UP to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7) to eat that apple. So that's also possible. But which path is shorter? Both require two moves to get the first apple. So it's a matter of which apple to take first. But since both are equally distant, maybe the (7,7) apple is better because after eating it, the next move can be down to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) if needed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after eating it, the snake can move up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7), but that would require the (7,7) apple to still be there. However, if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe that's a better strategy. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother consideration: the snake's body. After eating an apple, the body grows. So after taking (7,7), the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then moving left to (6,7) would leave the body at (8,7) and (9,7). Wait, no. Let me think again. When you eat an apple, the next move the body grows. So when you move to (7,7) and eat the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, the next move, when you move left to (6,7), the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ]. So the tail moves forward. Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the body grows by one. So the next move after eating, the tail doesn't move. So after eating (7,7), the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, moving left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ] because the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. Let me clarify the movement. Normally, each time the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. So if the snake is just the head (body empty), moving to (8,7) makes the body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, the next move, when you move left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The apple is eaten when you move into it. So after moving into (7,7), you eat the apple, so the next move, when you move again, the body grows. So the body after eating the apple would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, when you move left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail stays, so the total length increases by one. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.\n\nInitial state: head at (9,7), body empty.\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,7). Body becomes [ (9,7) ].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,7) and eat the apple. Because you ate an apple, the body grows by one. So the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ].\n\nMove 3: You move LEFT to (6,7). The body segments follow: the first body part moves to (8,7) -> (7,7), and the second part moves to (9,7) -> (8,7). Wait, no. The body follows the head. So when the head moves to (6,7), the body segments move to the previous positions of the head. So after move 3, the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you ate an apple in move 2, the body length increased by one. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you didn't eat an apple in move 3, the tail (last segment) is removed. Wait, no. When you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. So after move 3, the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you didn't eat an apple, the tail (oldest segment) is removed. Wait, no. The body grows when you eat an apple. So normally, each move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the body grows by one (the tail doesn't move). So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and since no apple was eaten, the tail (9,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (7,7) -> (6,7). The body segments follow: the first body part moves to where the head was (7,7), and the second moves to where the first was (8,7). But since no apple was eaten, the tail (last segment) is removed. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it as the body segments follow the head's path. So each time the head moves, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it. So if the body is [A, B], and the head moves to C, then the new body is [B, C's previous position]. Wait, no. Let's take an example.\n\nHead at (7,7), body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ].\n\nWait, no. After move 2, the head is at (7,7), and the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because when you ate the apple, the body grows. So the body is the previous positions of the head. So after move 1: head at (8,7), body [ (9,7) ].\n\nMove 2: head moves to (7,7), body becomes [ (8,7) ] and then because you ate an apple, the body grows by one, so it's [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, the body length increases by one. So normally, when you move, the body is the previous positions of the head. So if you have a body length of 0, moving to (8,7) gives body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) and eating an apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because you add a new segment. So the body length is now 2. Then, when you move again, the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail (oldest segment, (9,7)) is removed only if you didn't eat an apple. Wait, no. The tail is only removed if you don't eat an apple. So when you eat an apple, the tail stays, increasing the body length. When you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), no apple. So the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail (9,7) is removed. So the body is now [ (8,7), (7,7) ), length 2. So the snake's body is two segments long. \n\nThis is getting complicated, but I think the main point is that taking either apple is safe, and both require two moves. So the first move should be either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after taking (7,7), the next move could be down to (7,6), which is closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, no. (7,6) is not an apple. The apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). So from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then right to (8,6) would get that apple. That's two moves. But if I take (8,6) first, then from there, moving up to (8,7), then left to (7,7) would get that apple. So either way, both apples can be taken in four moves. \n\nBut since I have to choose the first move now, I need to decide between LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,3). Are they a threat? Probably not immediately, but maybe they are heading towards (2,4). But since they are far away, I don't need to worry about them yet. \n\nSo, which direction to choose? Maybe LEFT is better because it's a straight path towards (7,7), and after that, I can maneuver towards other apples. Alternatively, DOWN to (9,6) then LEFT to (8,6) is also good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,6) is better because after eating it, I can move up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7), but that would require that apple to still be there. However, since the apples are fixed (they don't respawn), once I eat one, it's gone. So if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So I can go for (7,7) next. \n\nBut if I take (7,7) first, then (8,6) is still there. So either way, I can get both apples. \n\nBut perhaps the (7,7) apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, both are two steps away. So it's a tie. \n\nAnother thought: moving LEFT first to (8,7) keeps me in the same row, which might be easier to navigate. Moving DOWN to (9,6) takes me to a different row, which might complicate future moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) and then LEFT to (8,6) gives me an apple, and then I can move UP to (8,7) and LEFT to (7,7) for another apple. That's four moves total. \n\nBut since I can only plan one move at a time, the first move is critical. \n\nI think I'll go with LEFT to (8,7) to head towards the (7,7) apple. That seems straightforward and safe. Then next move can be LEFT again to get the apple. \n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \n**Next Move:** LEFT  \n**Rationale:** The closest apple is at (7,7), two steps left from the current position (9,7). Moving LEFT first to (8,7) sets up a direct path to consume the apple next turn. This path avoids immediate threats and prioritizes growth efficiently."

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (9,8) now because the last move was UP from (9,7) to (9,8). The apples are still at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). The enemy snake is at (4,4) with no body.\n\nWait, the current position after moving UP is (9,8). The previous position was (9,7), but since the body was empty, now the body is [(9,7)]. So the snake's head is at (9,8), body at [(9,7)].\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (8,6) and (7,7). From (9,8), moving DOWN would take me to (9,7), which is part of my body now. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But RIGHT would take me to (10,8), which is outside the board (since x ranges 0-9). So RIGHT is invalid. So possible moves are LEFT to (8,8) or UP to (9,9).\n\nWait, current position is (9,8). Moving UP would take me to (9,9), which is the top-right corner. Moving LEFT to (8,8). Are there any apples nearby? The apples at (7,7) and (8,6) are the closest. Let's check distances.\n\nFrom (9,8) to (7,7): need to move left twice and down once. That's three moves. From (9,8) to (8,6): left once and down twice. Also three moves. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. Let's think. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, from (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) is a dead end, so not useful. So LEFT is better.\n\nBut moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7). That would get the apple. But that's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). That's two moves from (8,8). So total of three moves from (9,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN from (9,8) is invalid because it's my body. So can't. So only LEFT or UP. UP to (9,9) is a corner, which might be risky. So LEFT is better.\n\nAnother option: from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7) and then LEFT to (7,7). Either way, the apple at (7,7) is reachable in three moves.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). From (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN twice to (8,6). That's three moves. So both apples are three moves away. Which is better?\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can go down directly. But from (9,8), I can't go DOWN. So first move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then DOWN to (8,6). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). So both apples are three moves away.\n\nBut which path is safer? The enemy snake is at (4,4), which is far away. So no immediate threat. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating an apple, the body grows. So after three moves, the body would be longer. Need to avoid colliding with myself. For example, if I go for (7,7), after three moves, the body would be [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)] if I take the path LEFT, LEFT, DOWN. Wait, let's track:\n\nCurrent head: (9,8), body: [(9,7)].\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). Body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,8). Body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7)].\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (7,7). Body becomes [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7)] (since eating the apple, body grows by one). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, the body grows after the move. So after move 3, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8)] plus the new segment from growth. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nAfter move 1: head at (8,8), body is [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. When you move, the body follows. Original body was [(9,7)]. When you move to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)] (since the head was at (9,8) before moving). Wait, no. The body is the previous positions of the head. So when the head moves from (9,8) to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. But since the snake had a body of [(9,7)] before moving, I'm confused. Wait, the initial state after the last move (UP) is head at (9,8), body at [(9,7)]. So when moving LEFT to (8,8), the new body is [(9,8)] (the previous head position), and the old body segment (9,7) is removed because no apple was eaten. Wait, no. The body grows only when you eat an apple. So normally, each move, the body segments follow the head. So if the head moves to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it. \n\nSo initial state: head at (9,8), body at [(9,7)].\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). The body becomes [(9,8)]. The tail (oldest segment, (9,7)) is removed because no apple was eaten. So after move 1, the body is [(9,8)].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,8). Body becomes [(8,8)]. Tail (9,8) is removed.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (7,7) and eat the apple. Body becomes [(7,8), (8,8)] (since eating the apple adds a segment). So the body length increases by one. \n\nSo after three moves, the body is [(7,8), (8,8)]. The head is at (7,7). That seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,6):\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). Body becomes [(9,8)].\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,7). Body becomes [(8,8)].\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,6) and eat the apple. Body becomes [(8,7), (8,8)].\n\nThis path is also safe.\n\nSo both apples are reachable in three moves. Which one to choose?\n\nThe apple at (7,7) is closer to other apples like (2,4) and (0,6), but that's a longer-term consideration. For now, the priority is to get the closest apple safely.\n\nAnother factor: moving UP to (9,9) is possible, but there's no apple there, and it's a corner. So it's risky to get trapped. So better to avoid that.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up a path towards either (7,7) or (8,6). Since both are equally distant, but moving LEFT first is necessary. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \n**Next Move:** LEFT  \n**Rationale:** Moving LEFT to (8,8) positions the snake towards the nearest apples at (7,7) and (8,6) while avoiding collisions. This path keeps options open to target either apple next turn, ensuring safe growth."

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,7) with no body parts yet. The apples are at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). The enemy snake is at (4,3). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. The closest ones are (7,7) and (8,6). Wait, (7,7) is right next to me. My current position is (9,7). So moving left twice would get me to (7,7). But wait, moving left once would take me to (8,7), then left again to (7,7). That's two moves. But since each move is one step, maybe I can reach it in two moves. But right now, I can only choose the next direction. So from (9,7), possible moves are left, down, or up. Wait, moving up would take me to (9,8), which is empty. Moving down to (9,6), which is also empty. But the apple at (7,7) is two steps left and same y. So if I go left first, then next turn I can go left again to reach (7,7). But maybe there's a better option.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). From (9,7), moving down would take me to (9,6), then left to (8,6). That's two steps as well. So both apples are two steps away. Which one is safer? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,3), which is far away. So maybe both paths are safe. But I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (9,7) is okay, but moving left again would be (8,7), then (7,7). Wait, no. Wait, starting at (9,7), moving left once would be (8,7). Then next move left again to (7,7). So that's two moves. But the apple is at (7,7), so that's the target. Alternatively, moving down to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get that apple. Both apples are two steps away. Which path is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider possible collisions. Since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is not near either path. So maybe both are safe. But maybe the apple at (7,7) is closer. Let me check the coordinates again. The snake is at (9,7). The apple at (7,7) is two steps left. The apple at (8,6) is one step left and one step down. So both require two moves. But which one is more efficient? Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows. So after eating, the next move would have a body part. But since the body is empty now, after eating, the body would be the previous position. So if I go for (7,7), after moving left twice, I would have a body part at (9,7) and (8,7). But since the body is empty now, maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,6) would require moving down first. From (9,7) to (9,6) (DOWN), then LEFT to (8,6). That would get the apple there. Then the body would be at (9,7) and (9,6). Hmm. Both options seem okay. But maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so moving left twice. But wait, after the first move left to (8,7), the next move left to (7,7) would get the apple. Then the snake's body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ] after that. But since the body is empty now, after eating the apple, the body would grow by one. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (7,7), the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, no. Let me think. Normally, when a snake moves, each segment follows the head. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So if the snake is just the head (body is empty), moving to (8,7) would make the body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) would make the body [ (8,7) ], but if you eat an apple there, then the body would become [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves first. If there's no apple, the tail moves forward. If there is an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. Since currently, the snake's body is empty. So when the snake moves to (8,7), the body becomes [ (9,7) ]. Then, if the next move is to (7,7) and that's an apple, then the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because the tail doesn't move. So after eating the apple, the body grows. So in two moves, the snake would have a body of two segments. That's okay. But the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. So no immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, going for the (8,6) apple. First move DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6). That would also get an apple. Then the body would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ] after eating. Which path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. Moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) is safe. Then left again to (7,7) is safe. The enemy is at (4,3), so no collision there. Similarly, moving down to (9,6) is safe, then left to (8,6) is safe. Both paths seem okay.\n\nAnother consideration: after getting the apple, where to go next. If I take (7,7), then the next apples are (2,4), (0,6), (1,0). But maybe after that, moving towards (8,6) would be possible. Alternatively, after (8,6), maybe go towards (0,6) or (2,4). But perhaps the (7,7) apple is closer. Let me check the distances. From (9,7) to (7,7): two steps left. From (9,7) to (8,6): one down, one left. Both same distance. So either is fine. But maybe (7,7) is better because it's in the same row, so less direction changes. But maybe (8,6) is better because after that, moving towards (0,6) or (1,0) could be a path. Alternatively, after (7,7), moving down to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) or other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,6) is better because after eating it, the next move could be to (8,5) or (7,6), which might lead towards other apples. But I'm not sure. Let's think about possible paths. If I go for (7,7), then after that, the snake is at (7,7) with body [ (8,7), (9,7) ]. Then possible moves from there: left to (6,7), right to (8,7) (but that's the body), up to (7,8), or down to (7,6). So moving left to (6,7) would be safe. Then maybe towards (2,4) or other apples. Alternatively, moving down to (7,6) could lead towards (8,6) if that's still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then after that, the snake is at (8,6) with body [ (9,6), (9,7) ]. Then possible moves: left to (7,6), right to (9,6) (body), up to (8,7) (body?), wait, no. Wait, the body after eating (8,6) would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because the first move was down to (9,6), then left to (8,6). So the body would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because when you move down to (9,6), the body is [ (9,7) ]. Then moving left to (8,6) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move down from (9,7) to (9,6), the body becomes [ (9,7) ]. Then, when you move left to (8,6) and eat the apple there, the body grows by one, so the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because the tail doesn't move. So the body is the previous positions. So after two moves, the body is [ (9,7), (9,6) ] and the head is at (8,6). So from there, possible moves: left to (7,6), up to (8,7), down to (8,5), or right to (9,6) (which is part of the body). So moving left to (7,6) would be safe. Then maybe towards (2,4) or other apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,7), then after two moves, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ] and head at (7,7). Then possible moves: left to (6,7), up to (7,8), down to (7,6). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (4,3). Are they moving towards any apples? The apples at (2,4) is near them. So maybe they will go for that. But since they are at (4,3), moving up to (4,4) would get them closer to (2,4). But that's not directly. Maybe they'll move left and up. But I don't know their direction. But since they are far away, maybe it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, which direction to choose first? Let's see. If I go for (7,7), the first move is LEFT. If I go for (8,6), the first move is DOWN. So which is better? Let's check possible dangers. Moving LEFT to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe. Both are valid. But maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so less direction changes. Alternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after that, moving left towards (7,6) and then towards other apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,6) is too far, but the one at (1,0) is even further. So probably best to go for the closest apples first.\n\nAnother thought: after moving LEFT to (8,7), the next move would be LEFT again to (7,7) to get the apple. Then, the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, from (7,7), possible moves: left to (6,7), up to (7,8), down to (7,6). Let's say I go left again towards (6,7), then maybe towards (2,4). But that's a longer path. Alternatively, after (7,7), moving down to (7,6) could lead towards (8,6) if it's still there, but if I already took (7,7), then (8,6) is still there. Wait, but in the current state, the apples are at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). So if I take (7,7), that apple is gone. But the apple at (8,6) is still there. So after taking (7,7), maybe I can go down to (7,6) and then left to (6,6), etc. But maybe it's better to take (8,6) first, then (7,7) if possible. Wait, but (7,7) is an apple now. So if I take (7,7) first, then (8,6) is still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe taking (7,7) first is better because it's in the same row, and then I can go down to (7,6) and left towards (8,6). Wait, no. From (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then right to (8,6) would get that apple. But that's two moves. Alternatively, from (8,6), moving up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7) would get that apple, but that's also two moves. So maybe it's better to take the closest ones first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after taking it, the next move could be up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7). But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. Wait, but when I take an apple, does it disappear and reappear elsewhere? The problem statement says it's a multi-apple game, but I'm not sure if apples respawn. The initial apples are listed, so maybe they are fixed. So if I take (7,7), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples would be (2,4), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). So taking (7,7) first removes that apple. Taking (8,6) first removes that one. So maybe it's better to take both if possible. But since I can only take one at a time, I need to choose which to prioritize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after taking it, I can move towards (0,6) which is in the same column. From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), etc., towards (0,6). But that's a long path. Alternatively, after taking (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6), etc. But again, long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (1,0) apple is too far, so not worth considering now. The (2,4) apple is in the middle. So after taking either (7,7) or (8,6), the next target could be (2,4). But that's a longer path.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to go for the closest apple first. Both (7,7) and (8,6) are two steps away. So which one is safer? Let's check the paths again. Moving LEFT to (8,7) is safe. Then LEFT again to (7,7) to get the apple. That path is safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6) to get that apple. Both paths are safe. So either direction is okay. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a straight line. Alternatively, moving DOWN first might lead to more options. Let me think about the board layout. The apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. The snake is at (9,7). Moving down to (9,6) and then left to (8,6) would get that apple. Then, from (8,6), possible moves: left to (7,6), up to (8,7), down to (8,5). If I go left to (7,6), then maybe towards (7,7) if it's still there. But if I took (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe that's a better path. Alternatively, if I take (7,7) first, then from there, moving down to (7,6) and then right to (8,6) to get that apple. But that would require two moves again. So maybe taking (8,6) first allows me to then go up to (8,7) and left to (7,7) to get that apple. But wait, after taking (8,6), the next move could be up to (8,7), which is adjacent to (7,7). Then moving left to (7,7) would get that apple. So that's two moves again. So either path allows taking both apples in four moves. But since apples are fixed, maybe it's better to take whichever is closer first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so the path is straightforward. Let's choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move LEFT again to get (7,7). That way, I get the apple quickly and then can plan the next move. So first move: LEFT to (8,7). Then next move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That seems good. So the first move should be LEFT.\n\nBut wait, the current position is (9,7). Moving LEFT would take me to (8,7). Then next move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. Then the next move would be LEFT again. But since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. So this path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN first to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6) to eat that apple. Then next move could be UP to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7) to eat that apple. So that's also possible. But which path is shorter? Both require two moves to get the first apple. So it's a matter of which apple to take first. But since both are equally distant, maybe the (7,7) apple is better because after eating it, the next move can be down to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) if needed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after eating it, the snake can move up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7), but that would require the (7,7) apple to still be there. However, if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe that's a better strategy. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother consideration: the snake's body. After eating an apple, the body grows. So after taking (7,7), the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then moving left to (6,7) would leave the body at (8,7) and (9,7). Wait, no. Let me think again. When you eat an apple, the next move the body grows. So when you move to (7,7) and eat the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, the next move, when you move left to (6,7), the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ]. So the tail moves forward. Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the body grows by one. So the next move after eating, the tail doesn't move. So after eating (7,7), the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, moving left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ] because the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. Let me clarify the movement. Normally, each time the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. So if the snake is just the head (body empty), moving to (8,7) makes the body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, the next move, when you move left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The apple is eaten when you move into it. So after moving into (7,7), you eat the apple, so the next move, when you move again, the body grows. So the body after eating the apple would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, when you move left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail stays, so the total length increases by one. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.\n\nInitial state: head at (9,7), body empty.\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,7). Body becomes [ (9,7) ].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,7) and eat the apple. Because you ate an apple, the body grows by one. So the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ].\n\nMove 3: You move LEFT to (6,7). The body segments follow: the first body part moves to (8,7) -> (7,7), and the second part moves to (9,7) -> (8,7). Wait, no. The body follows the head. So when the head moves to (6,7), the body segments move to the previous positions of the head. So after move 3, the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you ate an apple in move 2, the body length increased by one. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you didn't eat an apple in move 3, the tail (last segment) is removed. Wait, no. When you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. So after move 3, the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you didn't eat an apple, the tail (oldest segment) is removed. Wait, no. The body grows when you eat an apple. So normally, each move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the body grows by one (the tail doesn't move). So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and since no apple was eaten, the tail (9,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (7,7) -> (6,7). The body segments follow: the first body part moves to where the head was (7,7), and the second moves to where the first was (8,7). But since no apple was eaten, the tail (last segment) is removed. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it as the body segments follow the head's path. So each time the head moves, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it. So if the body is [A, B], and the head moves to C, then the new body is [B, C's previous position]. Wait, no. Let's take an example.\n\nHead at (7,7), body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ].\n\nWait, no. After move 2, the head is at (7,7), and the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because when you ate the apple, the body grows. So the body is the previous positions of the head. So after move 1: head at (8,7), body [ (9,7) ].\n\nMove 2: head moves to (7,7), body becomes [ (8,7) ] and then because you ate an apple, the body grows by one, so it's [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, the body length increases by one. So normally, when you move, the body is the previous positions of the head. So if you have a body length of 0, moving to (8,7) gives body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) and eating an apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because you add a new segment. So the body length is now 2. Then, when you move again, the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail (oldest segment, (9,7)) is removed only if you didn't eat an apple. Wait, no. The tail is only removed if you don't eat an apple. So when you eat an apple, the tail stays, increasing the body length. When you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), no apple. So the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail (9,7) is removed. So the body is now [ (8,7), (7,7) ), length 2. So the snake's body is two segments long. \n\nThis is getting complicated, but I think the main point is that taking either apple is safe, and both require two moves. So the first move should be either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after taking (7,7), the next move could be down to (7,6), which is closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, no. (7,6) is not an apple. The apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). So from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then right to (8,6) would get that apple. That's two moves. But if I take (8,6) first, then from there, moving up to (8,7), then left to (7,7) would get that apple. So either way, both apples can be taken in four moves. \n\nBut since I have to choose the first move now, I need to decide between LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,3). Are they a threat? Probably not immediately, but maybe they are heading towards (2,4). But since they are far away, I don't need to worry about them yet. \n\nSo, which direction to choose? Maybe LEFT is better because it's a straight path towards (7,7), and after that, I can maneuver towards other apples. Alternatively, DOWN to (9,6) then LEFT to (8,6) is also good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,6) is better because after eating it, I can move up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7), but that would require that apple to still be there. However, since the apples are fixed (they don't respawn), once I eat one, it's gone. So if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So I can go for (7,7) next. \n\nBut if I take (7,7) first, then (8,6) is still there. So either way, I can get both apples. \n\nBut perhaps the (7,7) apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, both are two steps away. So it's a tie. \n\nAnother thought: moving LEFT first to (8,7) keeps me in the same row, which might be easier to navigate. Moving DOWN to (9,6) takes me to a different row, which might complicate future moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) and then LEFT to (8,6) gives me an apple, and then I can move UP to (8,7) and LEFT to (7,7) for another apple. That's four moves total. \n\nBut since I can only plan one move at a time, the first move is critical. \n\nI think I'll go with LEFT to (8,7) to head towards the (7,7) apple. That seems straightforward and safe. Then next move can be LEFT again to get the apple. \n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \n**Next Move:** LEFT  \n**Rationale:** The closest apple is at (7,7), two steps left from the current position (9,7). Moving LEFT first to (8,7) sets up a direct path to consume the apple next turn. This path avoids immediate threats and prioritizes growth efficiently."

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (9,8) now because the last move was UP from (9,7) to (9,8). The apples are still at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). The enemy snake is at (4,4) with no body.\n\nWait, the current position after moving UP is (9,8). The previous position was (9,7), but since the body was empty, now the body is [(9,7)]. So the snake's head is at (9,8), body at [(9,7)].\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (8,6) and (7,7). From (9,8), moving DOWN would take me to (9,7), which is part of my body now. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But RIGHT would take me to (10,8), which is outside the board (since x ranges 0-9). So RIGHT is invalid. So possible moves are LEFT to (8,8) or UP to (9,9).\n\nWait, current position is (9,8). Moving UP would take me to (9,9), which is the top-right corner. Moving LEFT to (8,8). Are there any apples nearby? The apples at (7,7) and (8,6) are the closest. Let's check distances.\n\nFrom (9,8) to (7,7): need to move left twice and down once. That's three moves. From (9,8) to (8,6): left once and down twice. Also three moves. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. Let's think. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, from (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) is a dead end, so not useful. So LEFT is better.\n\nBut moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7). That would get the apple. But that's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). That's two moves from (8,8). So total of three moves from (9,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN from (9,8) is invalid because it's my body. So can't. So only LEFT or UP. UP to (9,9) is a corner, which might be risky. So LEFT is better.\n\nAnother option: from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7) and then LEFT to (7,7). Either way, the apple at (7,7) is reachable in three moves.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). From (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN twice to (8,6). That's three moves. So both apples are three moves away. Which is better?\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can go down directly. But from (9,8), I can't go DOWN. So first move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then DOWN to (8,6). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). So both apples are three moves away.\n\nBut which path is safer? The enemy snake is at (4,4), which is far away. So no immediate threat. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating an apple, the body grows. So after three moves, the body would be longer. Need to avoid colliding with myself. For example, if I go for (7,7), after three moves, the body would be [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)] if I take the path LEFT, LEFT, DOWN. Wait, let's track:\n\nCurrent head: (9,8), body: [(9,7)].\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). Body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,8). Body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7)].\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (7,7). Body becomes [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7)] (since eating the apple, body grows by one). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, the body grows after the move. So after move 3, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8)] plus the new segment from growth. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nAfter move 1: head at (8,8), body is [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. When you move, the body follows. Original body was [(9,7)]. When you move to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)] (since the head was at (9,8) before moving). Wait, no. The body is the previous positions of the head. So when the head moves from (9,8) to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. But since the snake had a body of [(9,7)] before moving, I'm confused. Wait, the initial state after the last move (UP) is head at (9,8), body at [(9,7)]. So when moving LEFT to (8,8), the new body is [(9,8)] (the previous head position), and the old body segment (9,7) is removed because no apple was eaten. Wait, no. The body grows only when you eat an apple. So normally, each move, the body segments follow the head. So if the head moves to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it. \n\nSo initial state: head at (9,8), body at [(9,7)].\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). The body becomes [(9,8)]. The tail (oldest segment, (9,7)) is removed because no apple was eaten. So after move 1, the body is [(9,8)].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,8). Body becomes [(8,8)]. Tail (9,8) is removed.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (7,7) and eat the apple. Body becomes [(7,8), (8,8)] (since eating the apple adds a segment). So the body length increases by one. \n\nSo after three moves, the body is [(7,8), (8,8)]. The head is at (7,7). That seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,6):\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). Body becomes [(9,8)].\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,7). Body becomes [(8,8)].\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,6) and eat the apple. Body becomes [(8,7), (8,8)].\n\nThis path is also safe.\n\nSo both apples are reachable in three moves. Which one to choose?\n\nThe apple at (7,7) is closer to other apples like (2,4) and (0,6), but that's a longer-term consideration. For now, the priority is to get the closest apple safely.\n\nAnother factor: moving UP to (9,9) is possible, but there's no apple there, and it's a corner. So it's risky to get trapped. So better to avoid that.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up a path towards either (7,7) or (8,6). Since both are equally distant, but moving LEFT first is necessary. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \n**Next Move:** LEFT  \n**Rationale:** Moving LEFT to (8,8) positions the snake towards the nearest apples at (7,7) and (8,6) while avoiding collisions. This path keeps options open to target either apple next turn, ensuring safe growth."

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3,4) with no body. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFrom (8,8), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). That's the top edge. No apple there. It's a safe move but doesn't lead directly to an apple. However, it might be a dead end if there's no path to apples from there.\n  \n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). There's no apple here, but it's closer to the apple at (7,7) and (8,6). From (8,7), next moves could be LEFT to (7,7) for the apple or DOWN to (8,6) for another apple. This seems promising.\n  \n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). No apple here. From there, moving DOWN to (7,7) would get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT again to (6,8) but that's moving away from apples.\n  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). That's where the snake was previously. But since the body is empty now, it's safe. However, there's no apple there, and it's moving back towards the edge. Not ideal.\n\nThe closest apples are (7,7) and (8,6). Let's calculate the distance:\n\n- To (7,7) from (8,8): One move LEFT and one DOWN. Total of two moves.\n- To (8,6) from (8,8): Two moves DOWN. Also two moves.\n\nBoth are equally close. Which path is safer? Moving DOWN to (8,7) first allows flexibility. From (8,7), the next move can be LEFT to (7,7) or DOWN to (8,6). However, moving DOWN to (8,7) now doesn't risk any immediate collision. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) and then DOWN to (7,7) also works. But moving LEFT first might take longer if there's competition for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nConsidering growth: Eating an apple increases the body length. After eating, the next moves need to avoid the new body segment. Starting with DOWN to (8,7) sets up a path where, after eating (7,7) or (8,6), the body will trail behind, reducing collision risk.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7), positioning to reach either apple next turn. This keeps both options open and avoids dead ends.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Move:** DOWN  \n**Rationale:** Moving DOWN to (8,7) positions the snake to target the apples at (7,7) or (8,6) next turn. This maintains flexibility and minimizes collision risks while efficiently approaching the nearest apples."

The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. The closest ones are (7,7) and (8,6). Wait, (7,7) is right next to me. My current position is (9,7). So moving left twice would get me to (7,7). But wait, moving left once would take me to (8,7), then left again to (7,7). That's two moves. But since each move is one step, maybe I can reach it in two moves. But right now, I can only choose the next direction. So from (9,7), possible moves are left, down, or up. Wait, moving up would take me to (9,8), which is empty. Moving down to (9,6), which is also empty. But the apple at (7,7) is two steps left and same y. So if I go left first, then next turn I can go left again to reach (7,7). But maybe there's a better option.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). From (9,7), moving down would take me to (9,6), then left to (8,6). That's two steps as well. So both apples are two steps away. Which one is safer? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,3), which is far away. So maybe both paths are safe. But I need to avoid walls. Moving left from (9,7) is okay, but moving left again would be (8,7), then (7,7). Wait, no. Wait, starting at (9,7), moving left once would be (8,7). Then next move left again to (7,7). So that's two moves. But the apple is at (7,7), so that's the target. Alternatively, moving down to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get that apple. Both apples are two steps away. Which path is better?\n\nAlso, need to consider possible collisions. Since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is not near either path. So maybe both are safe. But maybe the apple at (7,7) is closer. Let me check the coordinates again. The snake is at (9,7). The apple at (7,7) is two steps left. The apple at (8,6) is one step left and one step down. So both require two moves. But which one is more efficient? Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows. So after eating, the next move would have a body part. But since the body is empty now, after eating, the body would be the previous position. So if I go for (7,7), after moving left twice, I would have a body part at (9,7) and (8,7). But since the body is empty now, maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,6) would require moving down first. From (9,7) to (9,6) (DOWN), then LEFT to (8,6). That would get the apple there. Then the body would be at (9,7) and (9,6). Hmm. Both options seem okay. But maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so moving left twice. But wait, after the first move left to (8,7), the next move left to (7,7) would get the apple. Then the snake's body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ] after that. But since the body is empty now, after eating the apple, the body would grow by one. So when you eat an apple, the next move the tail doesn't move. So after moving to (7,7), the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, no. Let me think. Normally, when a snake moves, each segment follows the head. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. So if the snake is just the head (body is empty), moving to (8,7) would make the body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) would make the body [ (8,7) ], but if you eat an apple there, then the body would become [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves first. If there's no apple, the tail moves forward. If there is an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. Since currently, the snake's body is empty. So when the snake moves to (8,7), the body becomes [ (9,7) ]. Then, if the next move is to (7,7) and that's an apple, then the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because the tail doesn't move. So after eating the apple, the body grows. So in two moves, the snake would have a body of two segments. That's okay. But the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away. So no immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, going for the (8,6) apple. First move DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6). That would also get an apple. Then the body would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ] after eating. Which path is safer? Let's check possible collisions. Moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) is safe. Then left again to (7,7) is safe. The enemy is at (4,3), so no collision there. Similarly, moving down to (9,6) is safe, then left to (8,6) is safe. Both paths seem okay.\n\nAnother consideration: after getting the apple, where to go next. If I take (7,7), then the next apples are (2,4), (0,6), (1,0). But maybe after that, moving towards (8,6) would be possible. Alternatively, after (8,6), maybe go towards (0,6) or (2,4). But perhaps the (7,7) apple is closer. Let me check the distances. From (9,7) to (7,7): two steps left. From (9,7) to (8,6): one down, one left. Both same distance. So either is fine. But maybe (7,7) is better because it's in the same row, so less direction changes. But maybe (8,6) is better because after that, moving towards (0,6) or (1,0) could be a path. Alternatively, after (7,7), moving down to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) or other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,6) is better because after eating it, the next move could be to (8,5) or (7,6), which might lead towards other apples. But I'm not sure. Let's think about possible paths. If I go for (7,7), then after that, the snake is at (7,7) with body [ (8,7), (9,7) ]. Then possible moves from there: left to (6,7), right to (8,7) (but that's the body), up to (7,8), or down to (7,6). So moving left to (6,7) would be safe. Then maybe towards (2,4) or other apples. Alternatively, moving down to (7,6) could lead towards (8,6) if that's still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then after that, the snake is at (8,6) with body [ (9,6), (9,7) ]. Then possible moves: left to (7,6), right to (9,6) (body), up to (8,7) (body?), wait, no. Wait, the body after eating (8,6) would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because the first move was down to (9,6), then left to (8,6). So the body would be [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because when you move down to (9,6), the body is [ (9,7) ]. Then moving left to (8,6) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you move down from (9,7) to (9,6), the body becomes [ (9,7) ]. Then, when you move left to (8,6) and eat the apple there, the body grows by one, so the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ]? Because the tail doesn't move. So the body is the previous positions. So after two moves, the body is [ (9,7), (9,6) ] and the head is at (8,6). So from there, possible moves: left to (7,6), up to (8,7), down to (8,5), or right to (9,6) (which is part of the body). So moving left to (7,6) would be safe. Then maybe towards (2,4) or other apples.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (7,7), then after two moves, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ] and head at (7,7). Then possible moves: left to (6,7), up to (7,8), down to (7,6). So maybe that's a good path.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (4,3). Are they moving towards any apples? The apples at (2,4) is near them. So maybe they will go for that. But since they are at (4,3), moving up to (4,4) would get them closer to (2,4). But that's not directly. Maybe they'll move left and up. But I don't know their direction. But since they are far away, maybe it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, which direction to choose first? Let's see. If I go for (7,7), the first move is LEFT. If I go for (8,6), the first move is DOWN. So which is better? Let's check possible dangers. Moving LEFT to (8,7) is safe. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe. Both are valid. But maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so less direction changes. Alternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after that, moving left towards (7,6) and then towards other apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,6) is too far, but the one at (1,0) is even further. So probably best to go for the closest apples first.\n\nAnother thought: after moving LEFT to (8,7), the next move would be LEFT again to (7,7) to get the apple. Then, the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, from (7,7), possible moves: left to (6,7), up to (7,8), down to (7,6). Let's say I go left again towards (6,7), then maybe towards (2,4). But that's a longer path. Alternatively, after (7,7), moving down to (7,6) could lead towards (8,6) if it's still there, but if I already took (7,7), then (8,6) is still there. Wait, but in the current state, the apples are at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). So if I take (7,7), that apple is gone. But the apple at (8,6) is still there. So after taking (7,7), maybe I can go down to (7,6) and then left to (6,6), etc. But maybe it's better to take (8,6) first, then (7,7) if possible. Wait, but (7,7) is an apple now. So if I take (7,7) first, then (8,6) is still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe taking (7,7) first is better because it's in the same row, and then I can go down to (7,6) and left towards (8,6). Wait, no. From (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then right to (8,6) would get that apple. But that's two moves. Alternatively, from (8,6), moving up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7) would get that apple, but that's also two moves. So maybe it's better to take the closest ones first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after taking it, the next move could be up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7). But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. Wait, but when I take an apple, does it disappear and reappear elsewhere? The problem statement says it's a multi-apple game, but I'm not sure if apples respawn. The initial apples are listed, so maybe they are fixed. So if I take (7,7), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples would be (2,4), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). So taking (7,7) first removes that apple. Taking (8,6) first removes that one. So maybe it's better to take both if possible. But since I can only take one at a time, I need to choose which to prioritize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after taking it, I can move towards (0,6) which is in the same column. From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), etc., towards (0,6). But that's a long path. Alternatively, after taking (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then left to (6,6), etc. But again, long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (1,0) apple is too far, so not worth considering now. The (2,4) apple is in the middle. So after taking either (7,7) or (8,6), the next target could be (2,4). But that's a longer path.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to go for the closest apple first. Both (7,7) and (8,6) are two steps away. So which one is safer? Let's check the paths again. Moving LEFT to (8,7) is safe. Then LEFT again to (7,7) to get the apple. That path is safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6) to get that apple. Both paths are safe. So either direction is okay. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a straight line. Alternatively, moving DOWN first might lead to more options. Let me think about the board layout. The apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. The snake is at (9,7). Moving down to (9,6) and then left to (8,6) would get that apple. Then, from (8,6), possible moves: left to (7,6), up to (8,7), down to (8,5). If I go left to (7,6), then maybe towards (7,7) if it's still there. But if I took (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe that's a better path. Alternatively, if I take (7,7) first, then from there, moving down to (7,6) and then right to (8,6) to get that apple. But that would require two moves again. So maybe taking (8,6) first allows me to then go up to (8,7) and left to (7,7) to get that apple. But wait, after taking (8,6), the next move could be up to (8,7), which is adjacent to (7,7). Then moving left to (7,7) would get that apple. So that's two moves again. So either path allows taking both apples in four moves. But since apples are fixed, maybe it's better to take whichever is closer first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (7,7) apple is better because it's in the same row, so the path is straightforward. Let's choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move LEFT again to get (7,7). That way, I get the apple quickly and then can plan the next move. So first move: LEFT to (8,7). Then next move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That seems good. So the first move should be LEFT.\n\nBut wait, the current position is (9,7). Moving LEFT would take me to (8,7). Then next move LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple. That's correct. So the first move is LEFT. Then the next move would be LEFT again. But since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is far away, there's no immediate threat. So this path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN first to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6) to eat that apple. Then next move could be UP to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7) to eat that apple. So that's also possible. But which path is shorter? Both require two moves to get the first apple. So it's a matter of which apple to take first. But since both are equally distant, maybe the (7,7) apple is better because after eating it, the next move can be down to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) if needed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the (8,6) apple is better because after eating it, the snake can move up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7), but that would require the (7,7) apple to still be there. However, if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So maybe that's a better strategy. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother consideration: the snake's body. After eating an apple, the body grows. So after taking (7,7), the body would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then moving left to (6,7) would leave the body at (8,7) and (9,7). Wait, no. Let me think again. When you eat an apple, the next move the body grows. So when you move to (7,7) and eat the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, the next move, when you move left to (6,7), the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ]. So the tail moves forward. Wait, no. Wait, when you eat an apple, the body grows by one. So the next move after eating, the tail doesn't move. So after eating (7,7), the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, moving left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ] because the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. Let me clarify the movement. Normally, each time the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by one. So if the snake is just the head (body empty), moving to (8,7) makes the body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, the next move, when you move left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you ate an apple, the tail doesn't move. Wait, no. The apple is eaten when you move into it. So after moving into (7,7), you eat the apple, so the next move, when you move again, the body grows. So the body after eating the apple would be [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, when you move left to (6,7), the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail stays, so the total length increases by one. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.\n\nInitial state: head at (9,7), body empty.\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,7). Body becomes [ (9,7) ].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,7) and eat the apple. Because you ate an apple, the body grows by one. So the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ].\n\nMove 3: You move LEFT to (6,7). The body segments follow: the first body part moves to (8,7) -> (7,7), and the second part moves to (9,7) -> (8,7). Wait, no. The body follows the head. So when the head moves to (6,7), the body segments move to the previous positions of the head. So after move 3, the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you ate an apple in move 2, the body length increased by one. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you didn't eat an apple in move 3, the tail (last segment) is removed. Wait, no. When you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. So after move 3, the body would be [ (8,7), (7,7) ), but since you didn't eat an apple, the tail (oldest segment) is removed. Wait, no. The body grows when you eat an apple. So normally, each move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. If you eat an apple, the body grows by one (the tail doesn't move). So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and since no apple was eaten, the tail (9,7) is removed. Wait, no. The tail is the last segment. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (7,7) -> (6,7). The body segments follow: the first body part moves to where the head was (7,7), and the second moves to where the first was (8,7). But since no apple was eaten, the tail (last segment) is removed. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it as the body segments follow the head's path. So each time the head moves, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it. So if the body is [A, B], and the head moves to C, then the new body is [B, C's previous position]. Wait, no. Let's take an example.\n\nHead at (7,7), body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ].\n\nWait, no. After move 2, the head is at (7,7), and the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because when you ate the apple, the body grows. So the body is the previous positions of the head. So after move 1: head at (8,7), body [ (9,7) ].\n\nMove 2: head moves to (7,7), body becomes [ (8,7) ] and then because you ate an apple, the body grows by one, so it's [ (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait, no. When you eat an apple, the body length increases by one. So normally, when you move, the body is the previous positions of the head. So if you have a body length of 0, moving to (8,7) gives body [ (9,7) ]. Then moving to (7,7) and eating an apple, the body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ] because you add a new segment. So the body length is now 2. Then, when you move again, the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail (oldest segment, (9,7)) is removed only if you didn't eat an apple. Wait, no. The tail is only removed if you don't eat an apple. So when you eat an apple, the tail stays, increasing the body length. When you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same. So after move 2, the body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then move 3: head moves to (6,7), no apple. So the body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ), and the tail (9,7) is removed. So the body is now [ (8,7), (7,7) ), length 2. So the snake's body is two segments long. \n\nThis is getting complicated, but I think the main point is that taking either apple is safe, and both require two moves. So the first move should be either LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother consideration: after taking (7,7), the next move could be down to (7,6), which is closer to the apple at (8,6). Wait, no. (7,6) is not an apple. The apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). So from (7,7), moving down to (7,6), then right to (8,6) would get that apple. That's two moves. But if I take (8,6) first, then from there, moving up to (8,7), then left to (7,7) would get that apple. So either way, both apples can be taken in four moves. \n\nBut since I have to choose the first move now, I need to decide between LEFT or DOWN. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy snake is at (4,3). Are they a threat? Probably not immediately, but maybe they are heading towards (2,4). But since they are far away, I don't need to worry about them yet. \n\nSo, which direction to choose? Maybe LEFT is better because it's a straight path towards (7,7), and after that, I can maneuver towards other apples. Alternatively, DOWN to (9,6) then LEFT to (8,6) is also good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,6) is better because after eating it, I can move up to (8,7) and then left to (7,7), but that would require that apple to still be there. However, since the apples are fixed (they don't respawn), once I eat one, it's gone. So if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) is still there. So I can go for (7,7) next. \n\nBut if I take (7,7) first, then (8,6) is still there. So either way, I can get both apples. \n\nBut perhaps the (7,7) apple is closer in terms of steps. Wait, both are two steps away. So it's a tie. \n\nAnother thought: moving LEFT first to (8,7) keeps me in the same row, which might be easier to navigate. Moving DOWN to (9,6) takes me to a different row, which might complicate future moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) and then LEFT to (8,6) gives me an apple, and then I can move UP to (8,7) and LEFT to (7,7) for another apple. That's four moves total. \n\nBut since I can only plan one move at a time, the first move is critical. \n\nI think I'll go with LEFT to (8,7) to head towards the (7,7) apple. That seems straightforward and safe. Then next move can be LEFT again to get the apple. \n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \n**Next Move:** LEFT  \n**Rationale:** The closest apple is at (7,7), two steps left from the current position (9,7). Moving LEFT first to (8,7) sets up a direct path to consume the apple next turn. This path avoids immediate threats and prioritizes growth efficiently."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (9,8) now because the last move was UP from (9,7) to (9,8). The apples are still at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0). The enemy snake is at (4,4) with no body.\n\nWait, the current position after moving UP is (9,8). The previous position was (9,7), but since the body was empty, now the body is [(9,7)]. So the snake's head is at (9,8), body at [(9,7)].\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (8,6) and (7,7). From (9,8), moving DOWN would take me to (9,7), which is part of my body now. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But RIGHT would take me to (10,8), which is outside the board (since x ranges 0-9). So RIGHT is invalid. So possible moves are LEFT to (8,8) or UP to (9,9).\n\nWait, current position is (9,8). Moving UP would take me to (9,9), which is the top-right corner. Moving LEFT to (8,8). Are there any apples nearby? The apples at (7,7) and (8,6) are the closest. Let's check distances.\n\nFrom (9,8) to (7,7): need to move left twice and down once. That's three moves. From (9,8) to (8,6): left once and down twice. Also three moves. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safer path. Let's think. If I move LEFT to (8,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. Alternatively, from (9,8), moving UP to (9,9) is a dead end, so not useful. So LEFT is better.\n\nBut moving LEFT to (8,8) is safe. Then next move LEFT to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7). That would get the apple. But that's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). That's two moves from (8,8). So total of three moves from (9,8).\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN from (9,8) is invalid because it's my body. So can't. So only LEFT or UP. UP to (9,9) is a corner, which might be risky. So LEFT is better.\n\nAnother option: from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7) and then LEFT to (7,7). Either way, the apple at (7,7) is reachable in three moves.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,6) is at (8,6). From (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN twice to (8,6). That's three moves. So both apples are three moves away. Which is better?\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can go down directly. But from (9,8), I can't go DOWN. So first move LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then DOWN to (8,6). That's three moves. Alternatively, from (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7). So both apples are three moves away.\n\nBut which path is safer? The enemy snake is at (4,4), which is far away. So no immediate threat. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating an apple, the body grows. So after three moves, the body would be longer. Need to avoid colliding with myself. For example, if I go for (7,7), after three moves, the body would be [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)] if I take the path LEFT, LEFT, DOWN. Wait, let's track:\n\nCurrent head: (9,8), body: [(9,7)].\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). Body becomes [(9,8), (9,7)].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,8). Body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7)].\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (7,7). Body becomes [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7)] (since eating the apple, body grows by one). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, the body grows after the move. So after move 3, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8)] plus the new segment from growth. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nAfter move 1: head at (8,8), body is [(9,8), (9,7)]? Wait, no. When you move, the body follows. Original body was [(9,7)]. When you move to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)] (since the head was at (9,8) before moving). Wait, no. The body is the previous positions of the head. So when the head moves from (9,8) to (8,8), the body becomes [(9,8)]. But since the snake had a body of [(9,7)] before moving, I'm confused. Wait, the initial state after the last move (UP) is head at (9,8), body at [(9,7)]. So when moving LEFT to (8,8), the new body is [(9,8)] (the previous head position), and the old body segment (9,7) is removed because no apple was eaten. Wait, no. The body grows only when you eat an apple. So normally, each move, the body segments follow the head. So if the head moves to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it. \n\nSo initial state: head at (9,8), body at [(9,7)].\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). The body becomes [(9,8)]. The tail (oldest segment, (9,7)) is removed because no apple was eaten. So after move 1, the body is [(9,8)].\n\nMove 2: LEFT to (7,8). Body becomes [(8,8)]. Tail (9,8) is removed.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (7,7) and eat the apple. Body becomes [(7,8), (8,8)] (since eating the apple adds a segment). So the body length increases by one. \n\nSo after three moves, the body is [(7,8), (8,8)]. The head is at (7,7). That seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, going for (8,6):\n\nMove 1: LEFT to (8,8). Body becomes [(9,8)].\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,7). Body becomes [(8,8)].\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,6) and eat the apple. Body becomes [(8,7), (8,8)].\n\nThis path is also safe.\n\nSo both apples are reachable in three moves. Which one to choose?\n\nThe apple at (7,7) is closer to other apples like (2,4) and (0,6), but that's a longer-term consideration. For now, the priority is to get the closest apple safely.\n\nAnother factor: moving UP to (9,9) is possible, but there's no apple there, and it's a corner. So it's risky to get trapped. So better to avoid that.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT to (8,8), setting up a path towards either (7,7) or (8,6). Since both are equally distant, but moving LEFT first is necessary. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \n**Next Move:** LEFT  \n**Rationale:** Moving LEFT to (8,8) positions the snake towards the nearest apples at (7,7) and (8,6) while avoiding collisions. This path keeps options open to target either apple next turn, ensuring safe growth."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation again. My snake (ID 2) is at (8,8) with an empty body. The apples are at (2,4), (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), and (1,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3,4) with no body. The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nFrom (8,8), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP**: Moving to (8,9). That's the top edge. No apple there. It's a safe move but doesn't lead directly to an apple. However, it might be a dead end if there's no path to apples from there.\n  \n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,7). There's no apple here, but it's closer to the apple at (7,7) and (8,6). From (8,7), next moves could be LEFT to (7,7) for the apple or DOWN to (8,6) for another apple. This seems promising.\n  \n- **LEFT**: Moving to (7,8). No apple here. From there, moving DOWN to (7,7) would get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT again to (6,8) but that's moving away from apples.\n  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,8). That's where the snake was previously. But since the body is empty now, it's safe. However, there's no apple there, and it's moving back towards the edge. Not ideal.\n\nThe closest apples are (7,7) and (8,6). Let's calculate the distance:\n\n- To (7,7) from (8,8): One move LEFT and one DOWN. Total of two moves.\n- To (8,6) from (8,8): Two moves DOWN. Also two moves.\n\nBoth are equally close. Which path is safer? Moving DOWN to (8,7) first allows flexibility. From (8,7), the next move can be LEFT to (7,7) or DOWN to (8,6). However, moving DOWN to (8,7) now doesn't risk any immediate collision. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) and then DOWN to (7,7) also works. But moving LEFT first might take longer if there's competition for the apple. The enemy snake is at (3,4), which is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nConsidering growth: Eating an apple increases the body length. After eating, the next moves need to avoid the new body segment. Starting with DOWN to (8,7) sets up a path where, after eating (7,7) or (8,6), the body will trail behind, reducing collision risk.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,7), positioning to reach either apple next turn. This keeps both options open and avoids dead ends.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \n**Next Move:** DOWN  \n**Rationale:** Moving DOWN to (8,7) positions the snake to target the apples at (7,7) or (8,6) next turn. This maintains flexibility and minimizes collision risks while efficiently approaching the nearest apples."

            "rationale": "Analyzing our current board, our snake\u2019s head is now at (2,4) with the only remaining body segment at (3,4) from our last move. Notice in row 4 there\u2019s an apple at (4,4) just to the right of our tail. Although moving right would normally appear to head into our own body, remember that when we move without eating an apple the tail is removed as we move; in this case the tail at (3,4) will be cleared, so advancing right is safe.\n\nIf we move right:\n\u2022 Our head will go to (3,4) (the tail\u2019s current position, which will be freed immediately).\n\u2022 The board will then show our snake as a single segment at (3,4), setting us up perfectly to move right again into (4,4) to grab the apple.\n\nOther moves (up, down, or left) would only take us further from that apple. Meanwhile, the enemy snake (Snake #2) at (8,7) is distant enough not to be a concern right now.\n\nThus, to efficiently collect the nearby apple at (4,4) next turn, my strategy is to move RIGHT now.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is currently at (8,7) after moving DOWN last turn. The apples are still at (7,7), (0,6), (8,6), (1,0), and (4,4). The enemy snake is at (2,4) with a body part at (3,4). \n\nFrom my current position (8,7), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP**: To (8,8). That's where I was before. Since my body is empty, it's safe. But no apple there. Moving up might take me away from the apples at (7,7) and (8,6). Not ideal unless I plan to loop around, but that's risky.\n\n- **DOWN**: To (8,6). There's an apple here! If I move DOWN, I can eat the apple, grow, and gain a point. That's a direct path. But after eating, my body will have a segment at (8,7). Next move, I need to avoid going back there. But since the body is just starting, it's manageable.\n\n- **LEFT**: To (7,7). Another apple here. Moving LEFT would get me the apple immediately. That's also a good option. Eating this apple would also add a body segment at (8,7). Then next move, I can go DOWN to (7,6) or other directions, but need to avoid backtracking.\n\n- **RIGHT**: To (9,7). That's the edge of the board. No apple there, and moving right would take me to the wall. If I go right, next move I can't go further right, so it's a dead end. Not useful.\n\nSo the best options are DOWN to (8,6) or LEFT to (7,7). Both have apples. Which is better?\n\nDistance-wise, both are one move away. Let's consider the next steps after eating:\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,6) and eat, my next position will be (8,6) with body at [(8,7)]. Then possible moves from there: UP (back to 8,7 which is body), LEFT (7,6), DOWN (8,5), RIGHT (9,6). So LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT are options. The closest apples would be (7,7) (but need to go up, which is blocked by body) or (4,4), (0,6), etc. So maybe move LEFT to (7,6) and then towards (7,7) again, but that apple might be gone by then.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,7) and eat, next position is (7,7) with body at [(8,7)]. Then possible moves: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7) which is body. So UP, DOWN, LEFT. From there, the next apple could be (8,6) if it's still there, or others. \n\nComparing the two, moving LEFT to (7,7) might be better because after eating, I can go DOWN to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) if that apple is still there. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,6) would let me eat that apple, but then moving LEFT to (7,6) could lead towards (7,7) if it's still available. \n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (2,4) with a body at (3,4). They are far away from both apples, so competition isn't immediate. Both apples are safe to take. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating, the body grows. So if I take (8,6), the body is at (8,7). If I take (7,7), the body is at (8,7). Either way, the body is in the same spot. \n\nBut moving LEFT to (7,7) might be better because after that, I can head towards (8,6) next if it's still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then (7,7) might still be there. However, apples might respawn or other snakes might take them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest path is to take the closest apple. Both are equally close. Let's check the board again. The apple at (8,6) is in column 8, row 6. The apple at (7,7) is in column 7, row 7. \n\nSince I'm at (8,7), moving LEFT to (7,7) gets me the apple there. Moving DOWN to (8,6) gets the other. Both are valid. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT to (7,7) is better because after that, I can move DOWN to (7,6) and then towards (8,6) if needed. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,6) and then LEFT to (7,6) to approach (7,7). \n\nHmm. Maybe either is fine, but since the enemy is far, I can safely take either. Let's pick LEFT to (7,7) to get that apple and then plan the next move from there. That way, I can also start moving towards the center of the board where more apples might be. \n\nWait, but the apple at (8,6) is closer in terms of being in the same column. Moving DOWN is a straight line. Maybe that's simpler. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the path after eating is better if I take (7,7). Let's think: after eating (7,7), I can go DOWN to (7,6), then RIGHT to (8,6) if that apple is still there. But if I take (8,6) first, then I can go LEFT to (7,6) and then UP to (7,7) if it's still there. \n\nBut since apples are present at both spots, and no other snakes are near, both are safe. So perhaps the best move is to take the apple at (7,7) by moving LEFT. That way, I can then head towards other apples like (4,4) or (0,6) from there. \n\nAlternatively, taking (8,6) and then moving towards (0,6) or (4,4). \n\nWait, (0,6) is far. (4,4) is also a bit far. The closest apples after these two would be (4,4) and (0,6). \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT to (7,7) is better because it's in the middle, allowing more options. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (8,6) and then LEFT to (7,6), then DOWN to (7,5), etc. \n\nHmm. I think either direction is valid, but since both apples are equally good, maybe prioritize the one that leads to a path with more options. \n\nMoving LEFT to (7,7) would place me at (7,7), which is near the center. From there, I can go DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7), or UP to (7,8). \n\nMoving DOWN to (8,6) would place me at (8,6), with options to go LEFT to (7,6), DOWN to (8,5), or RIGHT to (9,6) (but right is edge). \n\nBetween the two, (7,7) might offer more flexibility. So I'll choose LEFT to get the apple at (7,7). \n\nBut wait, the enemy snake is at (2,4). They are not a threat here. So it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (7,7) to eat the apple there.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \n**Next Move:** LEFT  \n**Rationale:** Moving LEFT to (7,7) allows the snake to consume the apple, grow, and position itself centrally for future moves towards other apples. This choice offers flexible paths (UP, DOWN, LEFT) post-consumption, avoiding immediate hazards and optimizing for subsequent apple collection."
