Since I'm already at (6, 4), I can try to move towards the apple at (8, 6) which is relatively close to me.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the enemy snake #2 which is at position (1, 9). I don't see its body, so I'm not sure how long it is, but I should be cautious not to move into its path.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the snake's body. Since I'm at (6, 4), I should try to move in a way that I don't run into my own body.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think my best strategy for this turn is to move right towards the apple at (8, 6).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

Moving up will not put the snake in immediate danger of running into walls or other snakes. The snake can move up to (2, 9) and then potentially move right to (2, 8) to get closer to the apple at (8, 9).\n\n**Strategy**: Move up to get closer to the apple at (8, 9) and then move right to get to the apple.\n\n**Next Move**: UP\n\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP."
