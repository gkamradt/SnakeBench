I need to ensure any movement doesn't bump into walls or other snakes.\n   - Moving UP to (8,5): No immediate obstacles.\n   - Moving RIGHT to (9,4): No immediate obstacles.\n   - Moving LEFT to (7,4): No immediate obstacles.\n   - Moving DOWN to (8,3): No immediate obstacles.\n\n2. **Check Apple Positions**: \n   - Closest apples on the board from my current position (8,4) are (7,7), (6,6), (3,2), (9,2), and (2,3).\n   - The apple at (9,2) is the closest when considering just linear distance in the right direction.\n   - The apples at (7,7) and (6,6) can be reached by moving LEFT initially and then UP, effectively capturing more points and growing the snake size.\n\n3. **Avoid the Enemy Snake**: The only enemy snake (#2), while at (5,8), currently doesn't pose a direct conflict from the looks of the board, especially with no known body size meaning it can't threaten immediately.\n\n4. **Plan of Action**:\n   - First target the nearby apple at (9,2), as reaching this takes two straightforward moves RIGHT (to (9,4) then DOWN (to (9,2))).\n   - This move set enables quick point gain and should leave other options open afterwards for either moving UP towards the cluster of apples at (7,7) and (6,6).\n\n5. **Strategy Next Turn**:\n   - Depending on the next state after collecting the apple at (9,2), evaluate the quickest route to further apples while avoiding new threats potentially introduced by snake #2\u2019s movements.\n\n**Selected Next Move**: RIGHT. This move puts me in position to quickly collect the apple at (9,2) next."
