The last move was DOWN.\n\n2. **Closest Apples**:\n   - **(5, 1), (7, 7), (8, 9)**: These apples are far but would start preparing going downwards towards (5, 1),\n   - **(2, 0)**: Achievable but must ensure vs algorithm for versus ending up having better give and take.\n   - **(8, 1)**: Avoid risk inevitably if snippet down is best towards evolving patterns.\n\n3. **Enemy Position**: Enemy Snake #1 is at (3, 4) with a body at [(4, 4), (5, 4)].\n\n4. **Upcoming Moves**:\n   - **UP**: (3, 6) - Directly collide with target avoiding risk against overall plan.\n   - **DOWN**: (3, 4) - Straight on detecting Snake #1 caught in sequential detectable.\n   - **LEFT**: (2, 6) - Chance avoidable  recruit avoiding risk of enemy moving towards the quadrant.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving East towards ensuring (5, 1).\n\n5. **Next Move Strategy**:\n    - Further going right smell towards (5,1) aligned direction.\n\n### Potential Obstacles:\nalready mentioned colliding and advocating cycling approaching.\n\nPromoting using apache collide movement gotten strategic next move have to have cycle moving.\n### Decision:\nBased on the above analysis, my next move is:\n\n**RIGHT**\n\nMoving up ensures towards.\nAlso, **Strategy** for next move: continuing towards the target single apple that is more feasible and stays non-media strong strategic risk controlled via increasing case to shift down if needed."
