            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (8,4). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (8,4), possible directions are UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). But I have to check if those moves are safe and lead to apples or not.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (7,2) which is two left and two down from my current position. But that's a bit far. (4,5) is left four and up one. (0,8) is way left and up, but that's a long path. (9,9) is top right corner, but moving right from (8,4) would take me to (9,4), then up. But maybe that's a longer path. (3,9) is up and left, but again, maybe not the closest.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left again to (6,4), then left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's five moves. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, if I go up first. Let's see: If I go UP to (8,5), then left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is not an apple. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is closer. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But that's a possible path. But moving left first would take me to (7,4), which is safe? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). So (7,4) is not adjacent to the enemy. So moving left to (7,4) is safe. Then down to (7,3), then (7,2) to get the apple. But that's three moves. But maybe I can get that apple if I plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is the top right. If I go right to (9,4), then up. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is on the left top. That's a long way, probably not worth it yet. The apple at (3,9) is also top left. So maybe the closest apples are (4,5) and (7,2).\n\nBut let's check the immediate next move. What's the safest direction? Let's check each possible direction:\n\nUP: (8,5). Is that a safe square? The board shows that at (4,5) there's an apple, but (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. The enemy is at (6,3), so (8,5) is safe. Moving up would take me towards the apple at (4,5) but that's a longer path. But maybe moving up is a safe direction.\n\nDOWN: (8,3). Is that safe? The enemy is at (6,3), which is two to the left. So (8,3) is two to the right of the enemy. So that's safe. But moving down from (8,4) to (8,3) would be okay. But where's the nearest apple? The apple at (7,2) is down and left. So moving down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But maybe that's a path.\n\nLEFT: (7,4). That's adjacent to the current position. Is there any danger here? The enemy is at (6,3), which is one left and one down from (7,4). So (7,4) is safe. Moving left here would get me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I then go down. Also, moving left could lead towards the apple at (4,5) if I go up later. So left might be a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,4). That's the edge of the board. Moving right here would take me to (9,4), which is safe (no walls yet, since the board is 0-9). But then I'm on the edge. From there, maybe up towards (9,9), but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best move.\n\nSo possible options: LEFT towards (7,4) to get closer to (7,2) or (4,5), UP towards (8,5) to maybe go towards (4,5), DOWN to (8,3) towards (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,4) which is edge.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). If I move left to (7,4), the enemy is at (6,3). So they could move up, right, or down. If they move right, they go to (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4). But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since they are at (6,3), their possible moves are up to (6,4), right to (7,3), down to (6,2), or left to (5,3). So if I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn, which is adjacent. But since I'm at (7,4), if the enemy moves to (7,3), then I could be in a position where I can go down to (7,3) and collide with them. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So moving left towards (7,4) might put me in a path that the enemy is also moving towards. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2). But then, the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). So that's two squares apart. Not a collision risk immediately. But maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,5) would take me towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer in terms of avoiding the enemy.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is in the middle. From (8,4), moving left four times and up once. But maybe that's a path. But moving left first would be better. Let's see: If I go left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), then left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's four moves. But each left move is safe as long as there's no obstacles. The enemy is at (6,3), so (6,4) is safe. But maybe the enemy could move up to (6,4) in their next move. So if I go to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I go to (6,4), I might collide. Hmm, that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going up first. If I go up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is the closest. Let's calculate the distance. From (8,4) to (7,2): that's two left and two down. So Manhattan distance is 4. The apple at (4,5) is four left and one up, Manhattan distance 5. So (7,2) is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nSo to get to (7,2), the path would be left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But need to check if those squares are safe. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn. If that happens, then when I try to go down to (7,3), I would collide with the enemy. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left first is risky if the enemy moves towards (7,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. From (8,4) to (8,3). Then left to (7,3), then left to (6,3) which is where the enemy is. Wait, that's a problem. Because moving left from (8,3) to (7,3) would be adjacent to the enemy's current position (6,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's also a risk.\n\nHmm. So maybe the safest path is to go towards the apple at (4,5). Let's see. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). But each step, need to check for safety. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I'm at (7,4), the enemy could move up to (6,4), which is adjacent to (7,4). So if I then move left to (6,4), I might collide if the enemy is there. But maybe the enemy is going for other apples. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is heading towards (7,2) as well. So perhaps the enemy's next move is down to (6,2) to get closer to (7,2). Or right to (7,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first. From (8,4) to (8,5). Then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe safer. The enemy is at (6,3), so moving up to (8,5) is away from the enemy. Then, moving left towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is possible. But that's a long way. From (8,4), moving right to (9,4), then up to (9,5), (9,6), etc. But that's 5 moves up. Not sure if that's worth it.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I can get to a position where the enemy might collide with me, but since they are just a head, maybe they can't block me unless they move into my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go left towards (7,4), which is closer to the apple at (7,2) and (4,5). But need to assess the risk of collision with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to (8,3) to get closer to (7,2). Let's see: from (8,3), next move could be left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving down is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,4). That's the edge. Then, moving up. But that's not towards any apple immediately. Unless there's an apple at (9,9). But that's a long way. So maybe not the best move.\n\nSo considering all options, perhaps the best move is LEFT to (7,4). That gets me closer to both (7,2) and (4,5). The risk is that the enemy might move into (7,3) or (6,4), but I can adjust next turn. For example, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves to (7,3), then next turn I can go down to (7,3) if the enemy is still there, but that would be a collision. So maybe I need to avoid that. Alternatively, if the enemy moves elsewhere, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (8,5) is safer. Then, next turn, I can move left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is safe. Let's check the board. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). So moving up to (8,5) doesn't get me an apple, but starts me on a path towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is a step towards two apples. But with some risk. But since the enemy is at (6,3), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right to (7,3), then (7,4) is adjacent. But if I move left to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy is at (7,3), I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where they are. So I would have to choose another direction. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards me. They might be going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So if I move left towards (7,4), and the enemy moves towards (7,2), then maybe we both are heading there, but I can get there first. Or maybe not.\n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's think about the immediate safety. Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe because there's no snake there. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So moving left is safe. Then, next turn, I can assess again. If the enemy moves towards (7,3), I can decide to go left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5), etc. So maybe moving left is the best option now to get closer to the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,5) is also safe. But that's moving away from the closer apple (7,2). So maybe not optimal.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Let's recheck:\n\nLEFT to (7,4): safe, closer to (7,2) and (4,5).\n\nDOWN to (8,3): safe, closer to (7,2).\n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is two steps from (8,4) if I go left then down. Or down then left. Both are three steps. Wait, from (8,4):\n\nLeft to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nDown to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nSame number of steps. But which path is safer?\n\nIf I go left first, then down, I might be closer to the enemy's position. If I go down first, then left, I'm moving into the same area but from a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards both apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is more likely to move towards (7,2) as well, so moving left first could get me there faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path for them.\n\nHmm. Since the enemy is at (6,3), the closest apple to them is (7,2) (distance of 1 right and 1 down) or (4,5) (distance of 2 left and 2 up). So the enemy might go for (7,2) first. So if I move left towards (7,4), I might be competing with the enemy for that apple. But if I can get there first, that's good. But if the enemy is closer, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy will move right to (7,3) next turn. Then, if I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2), but the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). Then, next turn, I can move left to (7,3), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. So that's also risky.\n\nHmm. So both options have risks. Maybe the safest move is to go UP to (8,5), which is away from the enemy and towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path, but safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,4) is safe, but not helpful. But maybe that's a way to avoid conflict.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is on the edge. Then, next turn, I can move up to (9,5), etc. But there's an apple at (9,9). That's five moves up. But maybe that's a path. But it's a long way. But if I can get there without competition, maybe it's worth it. But the enemy is at (6,3), so they are far from (9,9). So maybe that's a safer path. But it's a long way. But if I can collect that apple, it's a point. But it's risky because I have to move along the edge, which could be dangerous if the enemy comes that way. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is at (3,9). From (8,4), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Let's summarize:\n\nOptions:\n\n1. LEFT to (7,4): closer to apples but risk of enemy collision.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): closer to (7,2) but also risk.\n3. UP to (8,5): safer but longer path.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): edge, longer path.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect apples without dying, maybe the safest immediate move is UP. Because moving up takes me away from the enemy's current position and towards the apple at (4,5). Even though it's a longer path, it's safer. Then, next turn, I can plan to move left towards (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left is more aggressive towards apples but with higher risk.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), and their possible moves could be towards (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4), maybe moving left is risky. So perhaps UP is safer.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate safety. The current move: moving UP to (8,5) is safe. No snakes there, no walls. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is also safe. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So (7,4) is safe. So both LEFT and UP are safe moves.\n\nSo between those two, which is better. If I go left, I can start moving towards two apples. If I go up, I start moving towards one apple. So maybe left is better.\n\nBut the risk is that the enemy might move into the path. But since the enemy is a head with no body, they can move freely. So if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves right to (7,3), then next turn I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where the enemy is. So I would have to choose another direction, like left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5). But if I move left again to (6,4), then the enemy is at (7,3), so that's safe. Then, from (6,4), I can move left towards (5,4), etc., towards (4,5). So maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I move left to (6,4), I would collide. But the enemy's next move is unknown. So there's a risk.\n\nBut perhaps the potential reward of getting closer to apples is worth the risk. Since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe taking calculated risks is necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think moving LEFT to (7,4) is the best option. It gets me closer to two apples and starts me on a path towards them. The risk of collision with the enemy is present but manageable if I plan my next moves carefully.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points while avoiding risks, I'll move towards the nearest apple at (7,2) by heading left first. This positions me closer to multiple apples and avoids immediate danger from the enemy snake. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (8,4), possible directions are UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). But I have to check if those moves are safe and lead to apples or not.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (7,2) which is two left and two down from my current position. But that's a bit far. (4,5) is left four and up one. (0,8) is way left and up, but that's a long path. (9,9) is top right corner, but moving right from (8,4) would take me to (9,4), then up. But maybe that's a longer path. (3,9) is up and left, but again, maybe not the closest.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left again to (6,4), then left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's five moves. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, if I go up first. Let's see: If I go UP to (8,5), then left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is not an apple. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is closer. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But that's a possible path. But moving left first would take me to (7,4), which is safe? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). So (7,4) is not adjacent to the enemy. So moving left to (7,4) is safe. Then down to (7,3), then (7,2) to get the apple. But that's three moves. But maybe I can get that apple if I plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is the top right. If I go right to (9,4), then up. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is on the left top. That's a long way, probably not worth it yet. The apple at (3,9) is also top left. So maybe the closest apples are (4,5) and (7,2).\n\nBut let's check the immediate next move. What's the safest direction? Let's check each possible direction:\n\nUP: (8,5). Is that a safe square? The board shows that at (4,5) there's an apple, but (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. The enemy is at (6,3), so (8,5) is safe. Moving up would take me towards the apple at (4,5) but that's a longer path. But maybe moving up is a safe direction.\n\nDOWN: (8,3). Is that safe? The enemy is at (6,3), which is two to the left. So (8,3) is two to the right of the enemy. So that's safe. But moving down from (8,4) to (8,3) would be okay. But where's the nearest apple? The apple at (7,2) is down and left. So moving down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But maybe that's a path.\n\nLEFT: (7,4). That's adjacent to the current position. Is there any danger here? The enemy is at (6,3), which is one left and one down from (7,4). So (7,4) is safe. Moving left here would get me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I then go down. Also, moving left could lead towards the apple at (4,5) if I go up later. So left might be a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,4). That's the edge of the board. Moving right here would take me to (9,4), which is safe (no walls yet, since the board is 0-9). But then I'm on the edge. From there, maybe up towards (9,9), but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best move.\n\nSo possible options: LEFT towards (7,4) to get closer to (7,2) or (4,5), UP towards (8,5) to maybe go towards (4,5), DOWN to (8,3) towards (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,4) which is edge.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). If I move left to (7,4), the enemy is at (6,3). So they could move up, right, or down. If they move right, they go to (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4). But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since they are at (6,3), their possible moves are up to (6,4), right to (7,3), down to (6,2), or left to (5,3). So if I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn, which is adjacent. But since I'm at (7,4), if the enemy moves to (7,3), then I could be in a position where I can go down to (7,3) and collide with them. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So moving left towards (7,4) might put me in a path that the enemy is also moving towards. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2). But then, the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). So that's two squares apart. Not a collision risk immediately. But maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,5) would take me towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer in terms of avoiding the enemy.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is in the middle. From (8,4), moving left four times and up once. But maybe that's a path. But moving left first would be better. Let's see: If I go left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), then left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's four moves. But each left move is safe as long as there's no obstacles. The enemy is at (6,3), so (6,4) is safe. But maybe the enemy could move up to (6,4) in their next move. So if I go to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I go to (6,4), I might collide. Hmm, that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going up first. If I go up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is the closest. Let's calculate the distance. From (8,4) to (7,2): that's two left and two down. So Manhattan distance is 4. The apple at (4,5) is four left and one up, Manhattan distance 5. So (7,2) is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nSo to get to (7,2), the path would be left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But need to check if those squares are safe. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn. If that happens, then when I try to go down to (7,3), I would collide with the enemy. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left first is risky if the enemy moves towards (7,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. From (8,4) to (8,3). Then left to (7,3), then left to (6,3) which is where the enemy is. Wait, that's a problem. Because moving left from (8,3) to (7,3) would be adjacent to the enemy's current position (6,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's also a risk.\n\nHmm. So maybe the safest path is to go towards the apple at (4,5). Let's see. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). But each step, need to check for safety. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I'm at (7,4), the enemy could move up to (6,4), which is adjacent to (7,4). So if I then move left to (6,4), I might collide if the enemy is there. But maybe the enemy is going for other apples. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is heading towards (7,2) as well. So perhaps the enemy's next move is down to (6,2) to get closer to (7,2). Or right to (7,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first. From (8,4) to (8,5). Then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe safer. The enemy is at (6,3), so moving up to (8,5) is away from the enemy. Then, moving left towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is possible. But that's a long way. From (8,4), moving right to (9,4), then up to (9,5), (9,6), etc. But that's 5 moves up. Not sure if that's worth it.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I can get to a position where the enemy might collide with me, but since they are just a head, maybe they can't block me unless they move into my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go left towards (7,4), which is closer to the apple at (7,2) and (4,5). But need to assess the risk of collision with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to (8,3) to get closer to (7,2). Let's see: from (8,3), next move could be left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving down is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,4). That's the edge. Then, moving up. But that's not towards any apple immediately. Unless there's an apple at (9,9). But that's a long way. So maybe not the best move.\n\nSo considering all options, perhaps the best move is LEFT to (7,4). That gets me closer to both (7,2) and (4,5). The risk is that the enemy might move into (7,3) or (6,4), but I can adjust next turn. For example, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves to (7,3), then next turn I can go down to (7,3) if the enemy is still there, but that would be a collision. So maybe I need to avoid that. Alternatively, if the enemy moves elsewhere, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (8,5) is safer. Then, next turn, I can move left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is safe. Let's check the board. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). So moving up to (8,5) doesn't get me an apple, but starts me on a path towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is a step towards two apples. But with some risk. But since the enemy is at (6,3), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right to (7,3), then (7,4) is adjacent. But if I move left to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy is at (7,3), I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where they are. So I would have to choose another direction. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards me. They might be going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So if I move left towards (7,4), and the enemy moves towards (7,2), then maybe we both are heading there, but I can get there first. Or maybe not.\n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's think about the immediate safety. Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe because there's no snake there. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So moving left is safe. Then, next turn, I can assess again. If the enemy moves towards (7,3), I can decide to go left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5), etc. So maybe moving left is the best option now to get closer to the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,5) is also safe. But that's moving away from the closer apple (7,2). So maybe not optimal.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Let's recheck:\n\nLEFT to (7,4): safe, closer to (7,2) and (4,5).\n\nDOWN to (8,3): safe, closer to (7,2).\n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is two steps from (8,4) if I go left then down. Or down then left. Both are three steps. Wait, from (8,4):\n\nLeft to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nDown to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nSame number of steps. But which path is safer?\n\nIf I go left first, then down, I might be closer to the enemy's position. If I go down first, then left, I'm moving into the same area but from a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards both apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is more likely to move towards (7,2) as well, so moving left first could get me there faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path for them.\n\nHmm. Since the enemy is at (6,3), the closest apple to them is (7,2) (distance of 1 right and 1 down) or (4,5) (distance of 2 left and 2 up). So the enemy might go for (7,2) first. So if I move left towards (7,4), I might be competing with the enemy for that apple. But if I can get there first, that's good. But if the enemy is closer, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy will move right to (7,3) next turn. Then, if I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2), but the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). Then, next turn, I can move left to (7,3), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. So that's also risky.\n\nHmm. So both options have risks. Maybe the safest move is to go UP to (8,5), which is away from the enemy and towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path, but safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,4) is safe, but not helpful. But maybe that's a way to avoid conflict.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is on the edge. Then, next turn, I can move up to (9,5), etc. But there's an apple at (9,9). That's five moves up. But maybe that's a path. But it's a long way. But if I can get there without competition, maybe it's worth it. But the enemy is at (6,3), so they are far from (9,9). So maybe that's a safer path. But it's a long way. But if I can collect that apple, it's a point. But it's risky because I have to move along the edge, which could be dangerous if the enemy comes that way. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is at (3,9). From (8,4), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Let's summarize:\n\nOptions:\n\n1. LEFT to (7,4): closer to apples but risk of enemy collision.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): closer to (7,2) but also risk.\n3. UP to (8,5): safer but longer path.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): edge, longer path.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect apples without dying, maybe the safest immediate move is UP. Because moving up takes me away from the enemy's current position and towards the apple at (4,5). Even though it's a longer path, it's safer. Then, next turn, I can plan to move left towards (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left is more aggressive towards apples but with higher risk.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), and their possible moves could be towards (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4), maybe moving left is risky. So perhaps UP is safer.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate safety. The current move: moving UP to (8,5) is safe. No snakes there, no walls. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is also safe. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So (7,4) is safe. So both LEFT and UP are safe moves.\n\nSo between those two, which is better. If I go left, I can start moving towards two apples. If I go up, I start moving towards one apple. So maybe left is better.\n\nBut the risk is that the enemy might move into the path. But since the enemy is a head with no body, they can move freely. So if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves right to (7,3), then next turn I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where the enemy is. So I would have to choose another direction, like left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5). But if I move left again to (6,4), then the enemy is at (7,3), so that's safe. Then, from (6,4), I can move left towards (5,4), etc., towards (4,5). So maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I move left to (6,4), I would collide. But the enemy's next move is unknown. So there's a risk.\n\nBut perhaps the potential reward of getting closer to apples is worth the risk. Since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe taking calculated risks is necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think moving LEFT to (7,4) is the best option. It gets me closer to two apples and starts me on a path towards them. The risk of collision with the enemy is present but manageable if I plan my next moves carefully.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points while avoiding risks, I'll move towards the nearest apple at (7,2) by heading left first. This positions me closer to multiple apples and avoids immediate danger from the enemy snake. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

However, the enemy is at (5,3). If they move right to (6,3), then (7,3) is adjacent. Risk of collision if they move to (6,3) and then right again.\n3. **LEFT (6,4)**: Moves towards the apple at (4,5). The enemy is at (5,3), so (6,4) is two squares away.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (8,4). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (8,4), possible directions are UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). But I have to check if those moves are safe and lead to apples or not.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (7,2) which is two left and two down from my current position. But that's a bit far. (4,5) is left four and up one. (0,8) is way left and up, but that's a long path. (9,9) is top right corner, but moving right from (8,4) would take me to (9,4), then up. But maybe that's a longer path. (3,9) is up and left, but again, maybe not the closest.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left again to (6,4), then left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's five moves. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, if I go up first. Let's see: If I go UP to (8,5), then left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is not an apple. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is closer. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But that's a possible path. But moving left first would take me to (7,4), which is safe? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). So (7,4) is not adjacent to the enemy. So moving left to (7,4) is safe. Then down to (7,3), then (7,2) to get the apple. But that's three moves. But maybe I can get that apple if I plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is the top right. If I go right to (9,4), then up. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is on the left top. That's a long way, probably not worth it yet. The apple at (3,9) is also top left. So maybe the closest apples are (4,5) and (7,2).\n\nBut let's check the immediate next move. What's the safest direction? Let's check each possible direction:\n\nUP: (8,5). Is that a safe square? The board shows that at (4,5) there's an apple, but (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. The enemy is at (6,3), so (8,5) is safe. Moving up would take me towards the apple at (4,5) but that's a longer path. But maybe moving up is a safe direction.\n\nDOWN: (8,3). Is that safe? The enemy is at (6,3), which is two to the left. So (8,3) is two to the right of the enemy. So that's safe. But moving down from (8,4) to (8,3) would be okay. But where's the nearest apple? The apple at (7,2) is down and left. So moving down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But maybe that's a path.\n\nLEFT: (7,4). That's adjacent to the current position. Is there any danger here? The enemy is at (6,3), which is one left and one down from (7,4). So (7,4) is safe. Moving left here would get me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I then go down. Also, moving left could lead towards the apple at (4,5) if I go up later. So left might be a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,4). That's the edge of the board. Moving right here would take me to (9,4), which is safe (no walls yet, since the board is 0-9). But then I'm on the edge. From there, maybe up towards (9,9), but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best move.\n\nSo possible options: LEFT towards (7,4) to get closer to (7,2) or (4,5), UP towards (8,5) to maybe go towards (4,5), DOWN to (8,3) towards (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,4) which is edge.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). If I move left to (7,4), the enemy is at (6,3). So they could move up, right, or down. If they move right, they go to (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4). But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since they are at (6,3), their possible moves are up to (6,4), right to (7,3), down to (6,2), or left to (5,3). So if I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn, which is adjacent. But since I'm at (7,4), if the enemy moves to (7,3), then I could be in a position where I can go down to (7,3) and collide with them. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So moving left towards (7,4) might put me in a path that the enemy is also moving towards. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2). But then, the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). So that's two squares apart. Not a collision risk immediately. But maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,5) would take me towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer in terms of avoiding the enemy.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is in the middle. From (8,4), moving left four times and up once. But maybe that's a path. But moving left first would be better. Let's see: If I go left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), then left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's four moves. But each left move is safe as long as there's no obstacles. The enemy is at (6,3), so (6,4) is safe. But maybe the enemy could move up to (6,4) in their next move. So if I go to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I go to (6,4), I might collide. Hmm, that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going up first. If I go up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is the closest. Let's calculate the distance. From (8,4) to (7,2): that's two left and two down. So Manhattan distance is 4. The apple at (4,5) is four left and one up, Manhattan distance 5. So (7,2) is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nSo to get to (7,2), the path would be left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But need to check if those squares are safe. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn. If that happens, then when I try to go down to (7,3), I would collide with the enemy. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left first is risky if the enemy moves towards (7,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. From (8,4) to (8,3). Then left to (7,3), then left to (6,3) which is where the enemy is. Wait, that's a problem. Because moving left from (8,3) to (7,3) would be adjacent to the enemy's current position (6,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's also a risk.\n\nHmm. So maybe the safest path is to go towards the apple at (4,5). Let's see. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). But each step, need to check for safety. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I'm at (7,4), the enemy could move up to (6,4), which is adjacent to (7,4). So if I then move left to (6,4), I might collide if the enemy is there. But maybe the enemy is going for other apples. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is heading towards (7,2) as well. So perhaps the enemy's next move is down to (6,2) to get closer to (7,2). Or right to (7,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first. From (8,4) to (8,5). Then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe safer. The enemy is at (6,3), so moving up to (8,5) is away from the enemy. Then, moving left towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is possible. But that's a long way. From (8,4), moving right to (9,4), then up to (9,5), (9,6), etc. But that's 5 moves up. Not sure if that's worth it.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I can get to a position where the enemy might collide with me, but since they are just a head, maybe they can't block me unless they move into my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go left towards (7,4), which is closer to the apple at (7,2) and (4,5). But need to assess the risk of collision with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to (8,3) to get closer to (7,2). Let's see: from (8,3), next move could be left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving down is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,4). That's the edge. Then, moving up. But that's not towards any apple immediately. Unless there's an apple at (9,9). But that's a long way. So maybe not the best move.\n\nSo considering all options, perhaps the best move is LEFT to (7,4). That gets me closer to both (7,2) and (4,5). The risk is that the enemy might move into (7,3) or (6,4), but I can adjust next turn. For example, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves to (7,3), then next turn I can go down to (7,3) if the enemy is still there, but that would be a collision. So maybe I need to avoid that. Alternatively, if the enemy moves elsewhere, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (8,5) is safer. Then, next turn, I can move left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is safe. Let's check the board. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). So moving up to (8,5) doesn't get me an apple, but starts me on a path towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is a step towards two apples. But with some risk. But since the enemy is at (6,3), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right to (7,3), then (7,4) is adjacent. But if I move left to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy is at (7,3), I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where they are. So I would have to choose another direction. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards me. They might be going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So if I move left towards (7,4), and the enemy moves towards (7,2), then maybe we both are heading there, but I can get there first. Or maybe not.\n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's think about the immediate safety. Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe because there's no snake there. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So moving left is safe. Then, next turn, I can assess again. If the enemy moves towards (7,3), I can decide to go left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5), etc. So maybe moving left is the best option now to get closer to the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,5) is also safe. But that's moving away from the closer apple (7,2). So maybe not optimal.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Let's recheck:\n\nLEFT to (7,4): safe, closer to (7,2) and (4,5).\n\nDOWN to (8,3): safe, closer to (7,2).\n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is two steps from (8,4) if I go left then down. Or down then left. Both are three steps. Wait, from (8,4):\n\nLeft to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nDown to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nSame number of steps. But which path is safer?\n\nIf I go left first, then down, I might be closer to the enemy's position. If I go down first, then left, I'm moving into the same area but from a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards both apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is more likely to move towards (7,2) as well, so moving left first could get me there faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path for them.\n\nHmm. Since the enemy is at (6,3), the closest apple to them is (7,2) (distance of 1 right and 1 down) or (4,5) (distance of 2 left and 2 up). So the enemy might go for (7,2) first. So if I move left towards (7,4), I might be competing with the enemy for that apple. But if I can get there first, that's good. But if the enemy is closer, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy will move right to (7,3) next turn. Then, if I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2), but the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). Then, next turn, I can move left to (7,3), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. So that's also risky.\n\nHmm. So both options have risks. Maybe the safest move is to go UP to (8,5), which is away from the enemy and towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path, but safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,4) is safe, but not helpful. But maybe that's a way to avoid conflict.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is on the edge. Then, next turn, I can move up to (9,5), etc. But there's an apple at (9,9). That's five moves up. But maybe that's a path. But it's a long way. But if I can get there without competition, maybe it's worth it. But the enemy is at (6,3), so they are far from (9,9). So maybe that's a safer path. But it's a long way. But if I can collect that apple, it's a point. But it's risky because I have to move along the edge, which could be dangerous if the enemy comes that way. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is at (3,9). From (8,4), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Let's summarize:\n\nOptions:\n\n1. LEFT to (7,4): closer to apples but risk of enemy collision.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): closer to (7,2) but also risk.\n3. UP to (8,5): safer but longer path.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): edge, longer path.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect apples without dying, maybe the safest immediate move is UP. Because moving up takes me away from the enemy's current position and towards the apple at (4,5). Even though it's a longer path, it's safer. Then, next turn, I can plan to move left towards (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left is more aggressive towards apples but with higher risk.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), and their possible moves could be towards (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4), maybe moving left is risky. So perhaps UP is safer.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate safety. The current move: moving UP to (8,5) is safe. No snakes there, no walls. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is also safe. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So (7,4) is safe. So both LEFT and UP are safe moves.\n\nSo between those two, which is better. If I go left, I can start moving towards two apples. If I go up, I start moving towards one apple. So maybe left is better.\n\nBut the risk is that the enemy might move into the path. But since the enemy is a head with no body, they can move freely. So if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves right to (7,3), then next turn I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where the enemy is. So I would have to choose another direction, like left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5). But if I move left again to (6,4), then the enemy is at (7,3), so that's safe. Then, from (6,4), I can move left towards (5,4), etc., towards (4,5). So maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I move left to (6,4), I would collide. But the enemy's next move is unknown. So there's a risk.\n\nBut perhaps the potential reward of getting closer to apples is worth the risk. Since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe taking calculated risks is necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think moving LEFT to (7,4) is the best option. It gets me closer to two apples and starts me on a path towards them. The risk of collision with the enemy is present but manageable if I plan my next moves carefully.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points while avoiding risks, I'll move towards the nearest apple at (7,2) by heading left first. This positions me closer to multiple apples and avoids immediate danger from the enemy snake. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

The board hasn't changed much except for my new position.\n\nPossible moves from (7,4) are UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), or RIGHT to (8,4). Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (7,5)**: This moves me towards the apple at (4,5) but requires several left moves. Safe as no immediate threats here.\n2. **DOWN (7,3)**: Closer to the apple at (7,2). However, the enemy is at (5,3). If they move right to (6,3), then (7,3) is adjacent. Risk of collision if they move to (6,3) and then right again.\n3. **LEFT (6,4)**: Moves towards the apple at (4,5). The enemy is at (5,3), so (6,4) is two squares away.

The enemy snake #2 is at (5,3) with an empty body. So, their head is at (5,3) and no body segments.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (7,3) are UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), or RIGHT to (8,3). Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **DOWN (7,2)**: This is the location of an apple. If I move here, I eat the apple, grow, and gain a point. But I need to check if this is safe. The enemy is at (5,3). If they move right twice, they could reach (7,3) in two moves. But since they just moved to (5,3) last turn, their next move could be in any direction. However, moving down to (7,2) would immediately get the apple. The risk here is if the enemy is moving towards me. But their body is empty, so they can turn freely. If they move right to (6,3), then next turn they could be at (7,3), but I would already be at (7,2). So moving down seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **LEFT (6,3)**: This moves me closer to the enemy's current position (5,3). If the enemy moves right to (6,3), we could collide. Since their body is empty, they might be heading towards an apple. The apple at (4,5) is near them. Maybe they'll move up. But moving left here might risk collision if they move right. Not sure.\n\n3. **UP (7,4)**: This would take me back to where I was before. Not helpful unless avoiding a threat, but there's no immediate threat here. However, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2).\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving right doesn't lead towards any apples. The closest apple in that direction is (9,9), which is far. Not useful right now.\n\nThe best option seems to be moving DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. The enemy is at (5,3), so even if they move right once to (6,3), they can't reach (7,2) in one move. The next turn, if I'm at (7,2), I can consider moving left towards other apples or avoiding the enemy. Since the enemy's body is empty, they might be trying to get apples too. The apple at (4,5) is closer to them, so maybe they'll head there. \n\nAnother consideration: If I move down to (7,2), I need to check if that's a valid move. The board shows that (7,2) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. Since the enemy is at (5,3), they can't reach (7,2) in one move. So it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is DOWN to eat the apple and gain a point. No immediate collision risks detected.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: DOWN**  \n**Rationale:** Moving down to (7,2) allows me to consume the apple there, safely gaining a point. The enemy at (5,3) is unlikely to reach this position in one move, minimizing collision risk. Next turn, consider moving left towards (4,5) or assess enemy movements."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (8,4). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (8,4), possible directions are UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). But I have to check if those moves are safe and lead to apples or not.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (7,2) which is two left and two down from my current position. But that's a bit far. (4,5) is left four and up one. (0,8) is way left and up, but that's a long path. (9,9) is top right corner, but moving right from (8,4) would take me to (9,4), then up. But maybe that's a longer path. (3,9) is up and left, but again, maybe not the closest.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left again to (6,4), then left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's five moves. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, if I go up first. Let's see: If I go UP to (8,5), then left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is not an apple. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is closer. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But that's a possible path. But moving left first would take me to (7,4), which is safe? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). So (7,4) is not adjacent to the enemy. So moving left to (7,4) is safe. Then down to (7,3), then (7,2) to get the apple. But that's three moves. But maybe I can get that apple if I plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is the top right. If I go right to (9,4), then up. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is on the left top. That's a long way, probably not worth it yet. The apple at (3,9) is also top left. So maybe the closest apples are (4,5) and (7,2).\n\nBut let's check the immediate next move. What's the safest direction? Let's check each possible direction:\n\nUP: (8,5). Is that a safe square? The board shows that at (4,5) there's an apple, but (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. The enemy is at (6,3), so (8,5) is safe. Moving up would take me towards the apple at (4,5) but that's a longer path. But maybe moving up is a safe direction.\n\nDOWN: (8,3). Is that safe? The enemy is at (6,3), which is two to the left. So (8,3) is two to the right of the enemy. So that's safe. But moving down from (8,4) to (8,3) would be okay. But where's the nearest apple? The apple at (7,2) is down and left. So moving down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But maybe that's a path.\n\nLEFT: (7,4). That's adjacent to the current position. Is there any danger here? The enemy is at (6,3), which is one left and one down from (7,4). So (7,4) is safe. Moving left here would get me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I then go down. Also, moving left could lead towards the apple at (4,5) if I go up later. So left might be a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,4). That's the edge of the board. Moving right here would take me to (9,4), which is safe (no walls yet, since the board is 0-9). But then I'm on the edge. From there, maybe up towards (9,9), but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best move.\n\nSo possible options: LEFT towards (7,4) to get closer to (7,2) or (4,5), UP towards (8,5) to maybe go towards (4,5), DOWN to (8,3) towards (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,4) which is edge.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). If I move left to (7,4), the enemy is at (6,3). So they could move up, right, or down. If they move right, they go to (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4). But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since they are at (6,3), their possible moves are up to (6,4), right to (7,3), down to (6,2), or left to (5,3). So if I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn, which is adjacent. But since I'm at (7,4), if the enemy moves to (7,3), then I could be in a position where I can go down to (7,3) and collide with them. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So moving left towards (7,4) might put me in a path that the enemy is also moving towards. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2). But then, the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). So that's two squares apart. Not a collision risk immediately. But maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,5) would take me towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer in terms of avoiding the enemy.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is in the middle. From (8,4), moving left four times and up once. But maybe that's a path. But moving left first would be better. Let's see: If I go left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), then left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's four moves. But each left move is safe as long as there's no obstacles. The enemy is at (6,3), so (6,4) is safe. But maybe the enemy could move up to (6,4) in their next move. So if I go to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I go to (6,4), I might collide. Hmm, that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going up first. If I go up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is the closest. Let's calculate the distance. From (8,4) to (7,2): that's two left and two down. So Manhattan distance is 4. The apple at (4,5) is four left and one up, Manhattan distance 5. So (7,2) is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nSo to get to (7,2), the path would be left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But need to check if those squares are safe. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn. If that happens, then when I try to go down to (7,3), I would collide with the enemy. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left first is risky if the enemy moves towards (7,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. From (8,4) to (8,3). Then left to (7,3), then left to (6,3) which is where the enemy is. Wait, that's a problem. Because moving left from (8,3) to (7,3) would be adjacent to the enemy's current position (6,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's also a risk.\n\nHmm. So maybe the safest path is to go towards the apple at (4,5). Let's see. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). But each step, need to check for safety. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I'm at (7,4), the enemy could move up to (6,4), which is adjacent to (7,4). So if I then move left to (6,4), I might collide if the enemy is there. But maybe the enemy is going for other apples. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is heading towards (7,2) as well. So perhaps the enemy's next move is down to (6,2) to get closer to (7,2). Or right to (7,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first. From (8,4) to (8,5). Then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe safer. The enemy is at (6,3), so moving up to (8,5) is away from the enemy. Then, moving left towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is possible. But that's a long way. From (8,4), moving right to (9,4), then up to (9,5), (9,6), etc. But that's 5 moves up. Not sure if that's worth it.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I can get to a position where the enemy might collide with me, but since they are just a head, maybe they can't block me unless they move into my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go left towards (7,4), which is closer to the apple at (7,2) and (4,5). But need to assess the risk of collision with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to (8,3) to get closer to (7,2). Let's see: from (8,3), next move could be left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving down is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,4). That's the edge. Then, moving up. But that's not towards any apple immediately. Unless there's an apple at (9,9). But that's a long way. So maybe not the best move.\n\nSo considering all options, perhaps the best move is LEFT to (7,4). That gets me closer to both (7,2) and (4,5). The risk is that the enemy might move into (7,3) or (6,4), but I can adjust next turn. For example, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves to (7,3), then next turn I can go down to (7,3) if the enemy is still there, but that would be a collision. So maybe I need to avoid that. Alternatively, if the enemy moves elsewhere, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (8,5) is safer. Then, next turn, I can move left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is safe. Let's check the board. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). So moving up to (8,5) doesn't get me an apple, but starts me on a path towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is a step towards two apples. But with some risk. But since the enemy is at (6,3), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right to (7,3), then (7,4) is adjacent. But if I move left to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy is at (7,3), I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where they are. So I would have to choose another direction. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards me. They might be going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So if I move left towards (7,4), and the enemy moves towards (7,2), then maybe we both are heading there, but I can get there first. Or maybe not.\n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's think about the immediate safety. Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe because there's no snake there. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So moving left is safe. Then, next turn, I can assess again. If the enemy moves towards (7,3), I can decide to go left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5), etc. So maybe moving left is the best option now to get closer to the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,5) is also safe. But that's moving away from the closer apple (7,2). So maybe not optimal.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Let's recheck:\n\nLEFT to (7,4): safe, closer to (7,2) and (4,5).\n\nDOWN to (8,3): safe, closer to (7,2).\n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is two steps from (8,4) if I go left then down. Or down then left. Both are three steps. Wait, from (8,4):\n\nLeft to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nDown to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nSame number of steps. But which path is safer?\n\nIf I go left first, then down, I might be closer to the enemy's position. If I go down first, then left, I'm moving into the same area but from a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards both apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is more likely to move towards (7,2) as well, so moving left first could get me there faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path for them.\n\nHmm. Since the enemy is at (6,3), the closest apple to them is (7,2) (distance of 1 right and 1 down) or (4,5) (distance of 2 left and 2 up). So the enemy might go for (7,2) first. So if I move left towards (7,4), I might be competing with the enemy for that apple. But if I can get there first, that's good. But if the enemy is closer, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy will move right to (7,3) next turn. Then, if I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2), but the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). Then, next turn, I can move left to (7,3), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. So that's also risky.\n\nHmm. So both options have risks. Maybe the safest move is to go UP to (8,5), which is away from the enemy and towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path, but safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,4) is safe, but not helpful. But maybe that's a way to avoid conflict.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is on the edge. Then, next turn, I can move up to (9,5), etc. But there's an apple at (9,9). That's five moves up. But maybe that's a path. But it's a long way. But if I can get there without competition, maybe it's worth it. But the enemy is at (6,3), so they are far from (9,9). So maybe that's a safer path. But it's a long way. But if I can collect that apple, it's a point. But it's risky because I have to move along the edge, which could be dangerous if the enemy comes that way. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is at (3,9). From (8,4), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Let's summarize:\n\nOptions:\n\n1. LEFT to (7,4): closer to apples but risk of enemy collision.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): closer to (7,2) but also risk.\n3. UP to (8,5): safer but longer path.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): edge, longer path.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect apples without dying, maybe the safest immediate move is UP. Because moving up takes me away from the enemy's current position and towards the apple at (4,5). Even though it's a longer path, it's safer. Then, next turn, I can plan to move left towards (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left is more aggressive towards apples but with higher risk.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), and their possible moves could be towards (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4), maybe moving left is risky. So perhaps UP is safer.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate safety. The current move: moving UP to (8,5) is safe. No snakes there, no walls. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is also safe. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So (7,4) is safe. So both LEFT and UP are safe moves.\n\nSo between those two, which is better. If I go left, I can start moving towards two apples. If I go up, I start moving towards one apple. So maybe left is better.\n\nBut the risk is that the enemy might move into the path. But since the enemy is a head with no body, they can move freely. So if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves right to (7,3), then next turn I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where the enemy is. So I would have to choose another direction, like left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5). But if I move left again to (6,4), then the enemy is at (7,3), so that's safe. Then, from (6,4), I can move left towards (5,4), etc., towards (4,5). So maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I move left to (6,4), I would collide. But the enemy's next move is unknown. So there's a risk.\n\nBut perhaps the potential reward of getting closer to apples is worth the risk. Since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe taking calculated risks is necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think moving LEFT to (7,4) is the best option. It gets me closer to two apples and starts me on a path towards them. The risk of collision with the enemy is present but manageable if I plan my next moves carefully.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points while avoiding risks, I'll move towards the nearest apple at (7,2) by heading left first. This positions me closer to multiple apples and avoids immediate danger from the enemy snake. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **DOWN (7,2)**: This is the location of an apple. If I move here, I eat the apple, grow, and gain a point. But I need to check if this is safe. The enemy is at (5,3). If they move right twice, they could reach (7,3) in two moves. But since they just moved to (5,3) last turn, their next move could be in any direction. However, moving down to (7,2) would immediately get the apple. The risk here is if the enemy is moving towards me. But their body is empty, so they can turn freely. If they move right to (6,3), then next turn they could be at (7,3), but I would already be at (7,2). So moving down seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **LEFT (6,3)**: This moves me closer to the enemy's current position (5,3). If the enemy moves right to (6,3), we could collide. Since their body is empty, they might be heading towards an apple. The apple at (4,5) is near them. Maybe they'll move up. But moving left here might risk collision if they move right. Not sure.\n\n3. **UP (7,4)**: This would take me back to where I was before. Not helpful unless avoiding a threat, but there's no immediate threat here. However, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2).\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving right doesn't lead towards any apples. The closest apple in that direction is (9,9), which is far. Not useful right now.\n\nThe best option seems to be moving DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. The enemy is at (5,3), so even if they move right once to (6,3), they can't reach (7,2) in one move. The next turn, if I'm at (7,2), I can consider moving left towards other apples or avoiding the enemy. Since the enemy's body is empty, they might be trying to get apples too. The apple at (4,5) is closer to them, so maybe they'll head there. \n\nAnother consideration: If I move down to (7,2), I need to check if that's a valid move.

Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (6,4)**: Moving up here doesn't lead directly to an apple. The closest apple in that direction is (4,5) which is two up and two left. Not immediately beneficial. Also, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2) which is just below my previous position.\n\n2. **DOWN (6,2)**: This would take me to (6,2). The apple at (7,2) is one step to the right. If I move down here, next turn I could go RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. But that delays getting the apple by a turn. However, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards that apple as well.\n\n3. **LEFT (5,3)**: Moving left towards (5,3) brings me closer to the enemy snake at (3,3). If the enemy moves right, they could reach (4,3) or (5,3) in two moves. But since their body is empty, they might be heading towards the apple at (4,5) by moving up. However, moving left here might risk collision if they move right towards me. For example, if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3) next, then I'm at (5,3), and they could move to (5,3) the following turn. But since their body is empty, they can turn freely. This seems risky.\n\n4. **RIGHT (7,3)**: Moving back to (7,3) where I was before. The apple at (7,2) is directly below that position. If I move RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn I can move DOWN to (7,2) to get the apple. But why not go directly towards the apple now? Wait, from (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) would allow me to then move DOWN to (7,2) next turn. However, if I move RIGHT now, I might be giving the enemy a chance to take the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2) next turn. But that's two moves to get the apple. Alternatively, if I move RIGHT now to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. That's two moves, but maybe safer.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,2) is still there. Let me check the board state again. The board shows at (7,2) there's an apple (A). So if I can reach it in one move, that's better. From (6,3), moving DOWN to (6,2) doesn't get me closer to (7,2). To reach (7,2), I need to move RIGHT to (7,3) then DOWN, or move RIGHT and then DOWN. Alternatively, from (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2). But that's two steps. Alternatively, is there a way to get there in one step? No, because from (6,3), moving RIGHT then DOWN is two steps. Wait, no. From (6,3), moving RIGHT takes me to (7,3). Then from there, moving DOWN takes me to (7,2). So two moves. Alternatively, if I move DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2), then RIGHT to (7,2). Also two moves. Either way, two moves to get the apple. But maybe the enemy snake is moving towards that apple as well. The enemy is at (3,3). To reach (7,2), they would need to move right four times and down once. That's five moves. So they are not an immediate threat for that apple. Therefore, perhaps it's safe to take the longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (6,3), moving LEFT twice and UP twice would get there. But that's a longer path. The apple at (0,8) is far to the left and up. The apple at (9,9) is top-right corner. The apple at (3,9) is top-left. So the closest apples are (7,2) and (4,5). \n\nSo the best immediate target is (7,2). To get there, I need to move RIGHT to (7,3) then DOWN. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now and then DOWN. But moving RIGHT now might be safe. Let's check for collision risks. The enemy is at (3,3). If they move RIGHT, they go to (4,3). Then again RIGHT to (5,3), etc. But they might be heading towards the apple at (4,5). To get to (4,5), they need to move UP twice and RIGHT once. So from (3,3), moving UP to (3,4), then UP to (3,5), then RIGHT to (4,5). So they might be moving up. Therefore, moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) is safe, as the enemy is moving up. \n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. That seems safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). But moving DOWN to (6,2) doesn't lead to any immediate apple. However, if I move DOWN to (6,2), then next turn RIGHT to (7,2) gets the apple. So that's two moves. But moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN next turn is also two moves. Either way, same number of steps. But moving RIGHT now might be better because it positions me closer to the apple. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT to (7,3) is adjacent to the apple at (7,2). So next turn, I can move DOWN to get it. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). Both are two moves. But moving RIGHT first might be better because it's a straight path. \n\nBut what if the enemy snake is moving towards (7,2)? If they are at (3,3), they need to move right four times and down once. That's five moves. So they can't reach it before me. Therefore, it's safe to take two moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better apple to target. The apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. From (6,3), moving LEFT twice and UP twice. That's four moves. But the apple at (7,2) is two moves. So (7,2) is better. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any immediate dangers? The enemy is at (3,3). Their possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. If they move RIGHT, they go to (4,3). If they move UP, they go to (3,4). If they move LEFT, they go to (2,3). If they move DOWN, they go to (3,2). Since their body is empty, they can choose any direction. But their goal is to get apples. The closest apple to them is (4,5), so they might move UP and RIGHT. So they might not be a threat to me immediately. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (7,3) seems safe. Then next turn, move DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (6,2) and then RIGHT. But moving RIGHT now is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) is safe. There's no snake there. The board shows that at (7,3), there's nothing. The enemy is at (3,3). So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,3) would bring me closer to the enemy. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3), then I'm at (5,3), which is still safe. But moving LEFT doesn't help me get any apples. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (7,3), setting up to get the apple at (7,2) next turn. That's the optimal path. \n\nAnother check: Are there any walls or other snakes in the direction? Moving RIGHT to (7,3) is within the 10x10 grid. No walls. No other snakes there. So it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) next turn to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: RIGHT**  \n**Rationale:** Moving right to (7,3) positions me to collect the apple at (7,2) next turn. The enemy at (3,3) is unlikely to interfere immediately, prioritizing their own path. This path avoids collision risks and secures the nearest apple efficiently. Next turn, plan to move DOWN to (7,2) for the point."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (8,4). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (8,4), possible directions are UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). But I have to check if those moves are safe and lead to apples or not.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (7,2) which is two left and two down from my current position. But that's a bit far. (4,5) is left four and up one. (0,8) is way left and up, but that's a long path. (9,9) is top right corner, but moving right from (8,4) would take me to (9,4), then up. But maybe that's a longer path. (3,9) is up and left, but again, maybe not the closest.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left again to (6,4), then left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's five moves. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, if I go up first. Let's see: If I go UP to (8,5), then left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is not an apple. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is closer. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But that's a possible path. But moving left first would take me to (7,4), which is safe? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). So (7,4) is not adjacent to the enemy. So moving left to (7,4) is safe. Then down to (7,3), then (7,2) to get the apple. But that's three moves. But maybe I can get that apple if I plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is the top right. If I go right to (9,4), then up. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is on the left top. That's a long way, probably not worth it yet. The apple at (3,9) is also top left. So maybe the closest apples are (4,5) and (7,2).\n\nBut let's check the immediate next move. What's the safest direction? Let's check each possible direction:\n\nUP: (8,5). Is that a safe square? The board shows that at (4,5) there's an apple, but (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. The enemy is at (6,3), so (8,5) is safe. Moving up would take me towards the apple at (4,5) but that's a longer path. But maybe moving up is a safe direction.\n\nDOWN: (8,3). Is that safe? The enemy is at (6,3), which is two to the left. So (8,3) is two to the right of the enemy. So that's safe. But moving down from (8,4) to (8,3) would be okay. But where's the nearest apple? The apple at (7,2) is down and left. So moving down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But maybe that's a path.\n\nLEFT: (7,4). That's adjacent to the current position. Is there any danger here? The enemy is at (6,3), which is one left and one down from (7,4). So (7,4) is safe. Moving left here would get me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I then go down. Also, moving left could lead towards the apple at (4,5) if I go up later. So left might be a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,4). That's the edge of the board. Moving right here would take me to (9,4), which is safe (no walls yet, since the board is 0-9). But then I'm on the edge. From there, maybe up towards (9,9), but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best move.\n\nSo possible options: LEFT towards (7,4) to get closer to (7,2) or (4,5), UP towards (8,5) to maybe go towards (4,5), DOWN to (8,3) towards (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,4) which is edge.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). If I move left to (7,4), the enemy is at (6,3). So they could move up, right, or down. If they move right, they go to (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4). But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since they are at (6,3), their possible moves are up to (6,4), right to (7,3), down to (6,2), or left to (5,3). So if I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn, which is adjacent. But since I'm at (7,4), if the enemy moves to (7,3), then I could be in a position where I can go down to (7,3) and collide with them. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So moving left towards (7,4) might put me in a path that the enemy is also moving towards. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2). But then, the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). So that's two squares apart. Not a collision risk immediately. But maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,5) would take me towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer in terms of avoiding the enemy.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is in the middle. From (8,4), moving left four times and up once. But maybe that's a path. But moving left first would be better. Let's see: If I go left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), then left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's four moves. But each left move is safe as long as there's no obstacles. The enemy is at (6,3), so (6,4) is safe. But maybe the enemy could move up to (6,4) in their next move. So if I go to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I go to (6,4), I might collide. Hmm, that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going up first. If I go up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is the closest. Let's calculate the distance. From (8,4) to (7,2): that's two left and two down. So Manhattan distance is 4. The apple at (4,5) is four left and one up, Manhattan distance 5. So (7,2) is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nSo to get to (7,2), the path would be left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But need to check if those squares are safe. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn. If that happens, then when I try to go down to (7,3), I would collide with the enemy. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left first is risky if the enemy moves towards (7,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. From (8,4) to (8,3). Then left to (7,3), then left to (6,3) which is where the enemy is. Wait, that's a problem. Because moving left from (8,3) to (7,3) would be adjacent to the enemy's current position (6,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's also a risk.\n\nHmm. So maybe the safest path is to go towards the apple at (4,5). Let's see. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). But each step, need to check for safety. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I'm at (7,4), the enemy could move up to (6,4), which is adjacent to (7,4). So if I then move left to (6,4), I might collide if the enemy is there. But maybe the enemy is going for other apples. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is heading towards (7,2) as well. So perhaps the enemy's next move is down to (6,2) to get closer to (7,2). Or right to (7,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first. From (8,4) to (8,5). Then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe safer. The enemy is at (6,3), so moving up to (8,5) is away from the enemy. Then, moving left towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is possible. But that's a long way. From (8,4), moving right to (9,4), then up to (9,5), (9,6), etc. But that's 5 moves up. Not sure if that's worth it.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I can get to a position where the enemy might collide with me, but since they are just a head, maybe they can't block me unless they move into my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go left towards (7,4), which is closer to the apple at (7,2) and (4,5). But need to assess the risk of collision with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to (8,3) to get closer to (7,2). Let's see: from (8,3), next move could be left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving down is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,4). That's the edge. Then, moving up. But that's not towards any apple immediately. Unless there's an apple at (9,9). But that's a long way. So maybe not the best move.\n\nSo considering all options, perhaps the best move is LEFT to (7,4). That gets me closer to both (7,2) and (4,5). The risk is that the enemy might move into (7,3) or (6,4), but I can adjust next turn. For example, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves to (7,3), then next turn I can go down to (7,3) if the enemy is still there, but that would be a collision. So maybe I need to avoid that. Alternatively, if the enemy moves elsewhere, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (8,5) is safer. Then, next turn, I can move left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is safe. Let's check the board. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). So moving up to (8,5) doesn't get me an apple, but starts me on a path towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is a step towards two apples. But with some risk. But since the enemy is at (6,3), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right to (7,3), then (7,4) is adjacent. But if I move left to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy is at (7,3), I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where they are. So I would have to choose another direction. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards me. They might be going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So if I move left towards (7,4), and the enemy moves towards (7,2), then maybe we both are heading there, but I can get there first. Or maybe not.\n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's think about the immediate safety. Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe because there's no snake there. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So moving left is safe. Then, next turn, I can assess again. If the enemy moves towards (7,3), I can decide to go left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5), etc. So maybe moving left is the best option now to get closer to the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,5) is also safe. But that's moving away from the closer apple (7,2). So maybe not optimal.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Let's recheck:\n\nLEFT to (7,4): safe, closer to (7,2) and (4,5).\n\nDOWN to (8,3): safe, closer to (7,2).\n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is two steps from (8,4) if I go left then down. Or down then left. Both are three steps. Wait, from (8,4):\n\nLeft to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nDown to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nSame number of steps. But which path is safer?\n\nIf I go left first, then down, I might be closer to the enemy's position. If I go down first, then left, I'm moving into the same area but from a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards both apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is more likely to move towards (7,2) as well, so moving left first could get me there faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path for them.\n\nHmm. Since the enemy is at (6,3), the closest apple to them is (7,2) (distance of 1 right and 1 down) or (4,5) (distance of 2 left and 2 up). So the enemy might go for (7,2) first. So if I move left towards (7,4), I might be competing with the enemy for that apple. But if I can get there first, that's good. But if the enemy is closer, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy will move right to (7,3) next turn. Then, if I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2), but the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). Then, next turn, I can move left to (7,3), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. So that's also risky.\n\nHmm. So both options have risks. Maybe the safest move is to go UP to (8,5), which is away from the enemy and towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path, but safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,4) is safe, but not helpful. But maybe that's a way to avoid conflict.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is on the edge. Then, next turn, I can move up to (9,5), etc. But there's an apple at (9,9). That's five moves up. But maybe that's a path. But it's a long way. But if I can get there without competition, maybe it's worth it. But the enemy is at (6,3), so they are far from (9,9). So maybe that's a safer path. But it's a long way. But if I can collect that apple, it's a point. But it's risky because I have to move along the edge, which could be dangerous if the enemy comes that way. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is at (3,9). From (8,4), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Let's summarize:\n\nOptions:\n\n1. LEFT to (7,4): closer to apples but risk of enemy collision.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): closer to (7,2) but also risk.\n3. UP to (8,5): safer but longer path.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): edge, longer path.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect apples without dying, maybe the safest immediate move is UP. Because moving up takes me away from the enemy's current position and towards the apple at (4,5). Even though it's a longer path, it's safer. Then, next turn, I can plan to move left towards (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left is more aggressive towards apples but with higher risk.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), and their possible moves could be towards (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4), maybe moving left is risky. So perhaps UP is safer.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate safety. The current move: moving UP to (8,5) is safe. No snakes there, no walls. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is also safe. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So (7,4) is safe. So both LEFT and UP are safe moves.\n\nSo between those two, which is better. If I go left, I can start moving towards two apples. If I go up, I start moving towards one apple. So maybe left is better.\n\nBut the risk is that the enemy might move into the path. But since the enemy is a head with no body, they can move freely. So if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves right to (7,3), then next turn I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where the enemy is. So I would have to choose another direction, like left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5). But if I move left again to (6,4), then the enemy is at (7,3), so that's safe. Then, from (6,4), I can move left towards (5,4), etc., towards (4,5). So maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I move left to (6,4), I would collide. But the enemy's next move is unknown. So there's a risk.\n\nBut perhaps the potential reward of getting closer to apples is worth the risk. Since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe taking calculated risks is necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think moving LEFT to (7,4) is the best option. It gets me closer to two apples and starts me on a path towards them. The risk of collision with the enemy is present but manageable if I plan my next moves carefully.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points while avoiding risks, I'll move towards the nearest apple at (7,2) by heading left first. This positions me closer to multiple apples and avoids immediate danger from the enemy snake. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

However, the enemy is at (5,3). If they move right to (6,3), then (7,3) is adjacent. Risk of collision if they move to (6,3) and then right again.\n3. **LEFT (6,4)**: Moves towards the apple at (4,5). The enemy is at (5,3), so (6,4) is two squares away.

If they move right twice, they could reach (7,3) in two moves. But since they just moved to (5,3) last turn, their next move could be in any direction. However, moving down to (7,2) would immediately get the apple. The risk here is if the enemy is moving towards me. But their body is empty, so they can turn freely. If they move right to (6,3), then next turn they could be at (7,3), but I would already be at (7,2). So moving down seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **LEFT (6,3)**: This moves me closer to the enemy's current position (5,3). If the enemy moves right to (6,3), we could collide. Since their body is empty, they might be heading towards an apple. The apple at (4,5) is near them. Maybe they'll move up. But moving left here might risk collision if they move right. Not sure.\n\n3. **UP (7,4)**: This would take me back to where I was before. Not helpful unless avoiding a threat, but there's no immediate threat here. However, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2).\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving right doesn't lead towards any apples. The closest apple in that direction is (9,9), which is far. Not useful right now.\n\nThe best option seems to be moving DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. The enemy is at (5,3), so even if they move right once to (6,3), they can't reach (7,2) in one move. The next turn, if I'm at (7,2), I can consider moving left towards other apples or avoiding the enemy. Since the enemy's body is empty, they might be trying to get apples too. The apple at (4,5) is closer to them, so maybe they'll head there. \n\nAnother consideration: If I move down to (7,2), I need to check if that's a valid move. The board shows that (7,2) is an apple, so moving there is safe as long as no other snake is there. Since the enemy is at (5,3), they can't reach (7,2) in one move. So it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is DOWN to eat the apple and gain a point. No immediate collision risks detected.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: DOWN**  \n**Rationale:** Moving down to (7,2) allows me to consume the apple there, safely gaining a point. The enemy at (5,3) is unlikely to reach this position in one move, minimizing collision risk. Next turn, consider moving left towards (4,5) or assess enemy movements."

            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake (ID 1) is at (6,3) now. The last move was LEFT, which brought me here from (7,3). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake #2 is at (3,3) with an empty body. The board shows that at y=3 (the third row from the bottom), my snake is at (6,3), and enemy snake is at (3,3). \n\nPossible moves from (6,3) are UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), or RIGHT to (7,3). Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (6,4)**: Moving up here doesn't lead directly to an apple. The closest apple in that direction is (4,5) which is two up and two left. Not immediately beneficial. Also, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2) which is just below my previous position.\n\n2. **DOWN (6,2)**: This would take me to (6,2). The apple at (7,2) is one step to the right. If I move down here, next turn I could go RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. But that delays getting the apple by a turn. However, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards that apple as well.\n\n3. **LEFT (5,3)**: Moving left towards (5,3) brings me closer to the enemy snake at (3,3). If the enemy moves right, they could reach (4,3) or (5,3) in two moves. But since their body is empty, they might be heading towards the apple at (4,5) by moving up. However, moving left here might risk collision if they move right towards me. For example, if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3) next, then I'm at (5,3), and they could move to (5,3) the following turn. But since their body is empty, they can turn freely. This seems risky.\n\n4. **RIGHT (7,3)**: Moving back to (7,3) where I was before. The apple at (7,2) is directly below that position. If I move RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn I can move DOWN to (7,2) to get the apple. But why not go directly towards the apple now? Wait, from (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) would allow me to then move DOWN to (7,2) next turn. However, if I move RIGHT now, I might be giving the enemy a chance to take the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2) next turn. But that's two moves to get the apple. Alternatively, if I move RIGHT now to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. That's two moves, but maybe safer.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,2) is still there. Let me check the board state again. The board shows at (7,2) there's an apple (A). So if I can reach it in one move, that's better. From (6,3), moving DOWN to (6,2) doesn't get me closer to (7,2). To reach (7,2), I need to move RIGHT to (7,3) then DOWN, or move RIGHT and then DOWN. Alternatively, from (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2). But that's two steps. Alternatively, is there a way to get there in one step? No, because from (6,3), moving RIGHT then DOWN is two steps. Wait, no. From (6,3), moving RIGHT takes me to (7,3). Then from there, moving DOWN takes me to (7,2). So two moves. Alternatively, if I move DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2), then RIGHT to (7,2). Also two moves. Either way, two moves to get the apple. But maybe the enemy snake is moving towards that apple as well. The enemy is at (3,3). To reach (7,2), they would need to move right four times and down once. That's five moves. So they are not an immediate threat for that apple. Therefore, perhaps it's safe to take the longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (6,3), moving LEFT twice and UP twice would get there. But that's a longer path. The apple at (0,8) is far to the left and up. The apple at (9,9) is top-right corner. The apple at (3,9) is top-left. So the closest apples are (7,2) and (4,5). \n\nSo the best immediate target is (7,2). To get there, I need to move RIGHT to (7,3) then DOWN. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now and then DOWN. But moving RIGHT now might be safe. Let's check for collision risks. The enemy is at (3,3). If they move RIGHT, they go to (4,3). Then again RIGHT to (5,3), etc. But they might be heading towards the apple at (4,5). To get to (4,5), they need to move UP twice and RIGHT once. So from (3,3), moving UP to (3,4), then UP to (3,5), then RIGHT to (4,5). So they might be moving up. Therefore, moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) is safe, as the enemy is moving up. \n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. That seems safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). But moving DOWN to (6,2) doesn't lead to any immediate apple. However, if I move DOWN to (6,2), then next turn RIGHT to (7,2) gets the apple. So that's two moves. But moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN next turn is also two moves. Either way, same number of steps. But moving RIGHT now might be better because it positions me closer to the apple. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT to (7,3) is adjacent to the apple at (7,2). So next turn, I can move DOWN to get it. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). Both are two moves. But moving RIGHT first might be better because it's a straight path. \n\nBut what if the enemy snake is moving towards (7,2)? If they are at (3,3), they need to move right four times and down once. That's five moves. So they can't reach it before me. Therefore, it's safe to take two moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better apple to target. The apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. From (6,3), moving LEFT twice and UP twice. That's four moves. But the apple at (7,2) is two moves. So (7,2) is better. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any immediate dangers? The enemy is at (3,3). Their possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. If they move RIGHT, they go to (4,3). If they move UP, they go to (3,4). If they move LEFT, they go to (2,3). If they move DOWN, they go to (3,2). Since their body is empty, they can choose any direction. But their goal is to get apples. The closest apple to them is (4,5), so they might move UP and RIGHT. So they might not be a threat to me immediately. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (7,3) seems safe. Then next turn, move DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (6,2) and then RIGHT. But moving RIGHT now is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) is safe. There's no snake there. The board shows that at (7,3), there's nothing. The enemy is at (3,3). So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,3) would bring me closer to the enemy. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3), then I'm at (5,3), which is still safe. But moving LEFT doesn't help me get any apples. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (7,3), setting up to get the apple at (7,2) next turn. That's the optimal path. \n\nAnother check: Are there any walls or other snakes in the direction? Moving RIGHT to (7,3) is within the 10x10 grid. No walls. No other snakes there. So it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) next turn to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: RIGHT**  \n**Rationale:** Moving right to (7,3) positions me to collect the apple at (7,2) next turn. The enemy at (3,3) is unlikely to interfere immediately, prioritizing their own path. This path avoids collision risks and secures the nearest apple efficiently. Next turn, plan to move DOWN to (7,2) for the point."

The enemy snake #2 is at (3,3) with an empty body.\n\nFrom my current position (6,3), the possible moves are UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), or RIGHT to (7,3). But wait, I just moved RIGHT to (7,3) in the last move. Wait, no, the user's last move information says that after moving LEFT, the snake was at (6,2). Wait, maybe I need to check the current position again. Wait, the initial problem states that the snake is currently positioned at (6,2). Wait, no, the user's last move information says that the direction was DOWN, and the snake was at (6,2). Wait, the initial problem says \"Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (6, 2)\". But in the board state, the snake is shown at (6,2) (y=2). Then the last move was direction DOWN, which would have moved from (6,3) to (6,2). Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (6, 2)\"\n\nBut in the board state, at y=2 (third row from the bottom), the snake is at (6,2). The last move was direction DOWN, which would have moved from (6,3) to (6,2). So the current position is (6,2). So possible moves from (6,2) are UP to (6,3), DOWN to (6,1), LEFT to (5,2), or RIGHT to (7,2). The apple at (7,2) is directly to the right. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collect the apple. That's the best move. But need to check for any dangers.\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (2,3) with body at []. Wait, in the initial problem, the enemy snakes positions are listed as \"Snake #2 is at position (2, 3) with body at []\". But in the board state, at y=3 (the row above), there's a 2 at (3,3). Wait, maybe there's a discrepancy. Let me check the board again.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\nRow 3 (y=3) is \". . 2 . . . . . . .\", which would be x=2, y=3. So snake #2 is at (2,3). But in the board's visual, the 2 is at (3,3). Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the user's description. Let me parse the board again.\n\nThe board is presented with y=9 at the top. The rows are labeled from 9 down to 0. The row labeled 3 (which is y=3) is:\n\n3 . . 2 . . . . . . .\n\nSo the columns are x=0 to x=9. So in row y=3, the 2 is at x=2, making the position (2,3). But in the enemy snake positions, it's stated as (2,3). So that's correct. So snake #2 is at (2,3). So their possible moves are UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3). \n\nSo from my current position (6,2), moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collect the apple there. That's the best move. No immediate threats from the enemy snake, as they are at (2,3), which is far away. Moving RIGHT to (7,2) is safe and gains a point. \n\nOther options: UP to (6,3) which is empty, but no apple. DOWN to (6,1), which is also empty. LEFT to (5,2), which doesn't lead to an apple. So RIGHT is the optimal move.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: RIGHT**  \n**Rationale:** Moving right to (7,2) immediately collects the apple, gaining a point. This is the shortest path with no collision risks. The enemy at (2,3) is too distant to interfere. Next, consider targeting the apple at (4,5) by moving left and up."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (8,4). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (8,4), possible directions are UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). But I have to check if those moves are safe and lead to apples or not.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (7,2) which is two left and two down from my current position. But that's a bit far. (4,5) is left four and up one. (0,8) is way left and up, but that's a long path. (9,9) is top right corner, but moving right from (8,4) would take me to (9,4), then up. But maybe that's a longer path. (3,9) is up and left, but again, maybe not the closest.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left again to (6,4), then left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's five moves. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, if I go up first. Let's see: If I go UP to (8,5), then left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is not an apple. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is closer. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But that's a possible path. But moving left first would take me to (7,4), which is safe? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). So (7,4) is not adjacent to the enemy. So moving left to (7,4) is safe. Then down to (7,3), then (7,2) to get the apple. But that's three moves. But maybe I can get that apple if I plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is the top right. If I go right to (9,4), then up. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is on the left top. That's a long way, probably not worth it yet. The apple at (3,9) is also top left. So maybe the closest apples are (4,5) and (7,2).\n\nBut let's check the immediate next move. What's the safest direction? Let's check each possible direction:\n\nUP: (8,5). Is that a safe square? The board shows that at (4,5) there's an apple, but (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. The enemy is at (6,3), so (8,5) is safe. Moving up would take me towards the apple at (4,5) but that's a longer path. But maybe moving up is a safe direction.\n\nDOWN: (8,3). Is that safe? The enemy is at (6,3), which is two to the left. So (8,3) is two to the right of the enemy. So that's safe. But moving down from (8,4) to (8,3) would be okay. But where's the nearest apple? The apple at (7,2) is down and left. So moving down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But maybe that's a path.\n\nLEFT: (7,4). That's adjacent to the current position. Is there any danger here? The enemy is at (6,3), which is one left and one down from (7,4). So (7,4) is safe. Moving left here would get me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I then go down. Also, moving left could lead towards the apple at (4,5) if I go up later. So left might be a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,4). That's the edge of the board. Moving right here would take me to (9,4), which is safe (no walls yet, since the board is 0-9). But then I'm on the edge. From there, maybe up towards (9,9), but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best move.\n\nSo possible options: LEFT towards (7,4) to get closer to (7,2) or (4,5), UP towards (8,5) to maybe go towards (4,5), DOWN to (8,3) towards (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,4) which is edge.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). If I move left to (7,4), the enemy is at (6,3). So they could move up, right, or down. If they move right, they go to (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4). But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since they are at (6,3), their possible moves are up to (6,4), right to (7,3), down to (6,2), or left to (5,3). So if I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn, which is adjacent. But since I'm at (7,4), if the enemy moves to (7,3), then I could be in a position where I can go down to (7,3) and collide with them. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So moving left towards (7,4) might put me in a path that the enemy is also moving towards. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2). But then, the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). So that's two squares apart. Not a collision risk immediately. But maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,5) would take me towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer in terms of avoiding the enemy.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is in the middle. From (8,4), moving left four times and up once. But maybe that's a path. But moving left first would be better. Let's see: If I go left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), then left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's four moves. But each left move is safe as long as there's no obstacles. The enemy is at (6,3), so (6,4) is safe. But maybe the enemy could move up to (6,4) in their next move. So if I go to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I go to (6,4), I might collide. Hmm, that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going up first. If I go up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is the closest. Let's calculate the distance. From (8,4) to (7,2): that's two left and two down. So Manhattan distance is 4. The apple at (4,5) is four left and one up, Manhattan distance 5. So (7,2) is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nSo to get to (7,2), the path would be left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But need to check if those squares are safe. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn. If that happens, then when I try to go down to (7,3), I would collide with the enemy. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left first is risky if the enemy moves towards (7,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. From (8,4) to (8,3). Then left to (7,3), then left to (6,3) which is where the enemy is. Wait, that's a problem. Because moving left from (8,3) to (7,3) would be adjacent to the enemy's current position (6,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's also a risk.\n\nHmm. So maybe the safest path is to go towards the apple at (4,5). Let's see. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). But each step, need to check for safety. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I'm at (7,4), the enemy could move up to (6,4), which is adjacent to (7,4). So if I then move left to (6,4), I might collide if the enemy is there. But maybe the enemy is going for other apples. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is heading towards (7,2) as well. So perhaps the enemy's next move is down to (6,2) to get closer to (7,2). Or right to (7,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first. From (8,4) to (8,5). Then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe safer. The enemy is at (6,3), so moving up to (8,5) is away from the enemy. Then, moving left towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is possible. But that's a long way. From (8,4), moving right to (9,4), then up to (9,5), (9,6), etc. But that's 5 moves up. Not sure if that's worth it.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I can get to a position where the enemy might collide with me, but since they are just a head, maybe they can't block me unless they move into my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go left towards (7,4), which is closer to the apple at (7,2) and (4,5). But need to assess the risk of collision with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to (8,3) to get closer to (7,2). Let's see: from (8,3), next move could be left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving down is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,4). That's the edge. Then, moving up. But that's not towards any apple immediately. Unless there's an apple at (9,9). But that's a long way. So maybe not the best move.\n\nSo considering all options, perhaps the best move is LEFT to (7,4). That gets me closer to both (7,2) and (4,5). The risk is that the enemy might move into (7,3) or (6,4), but I can adjust next turn. For example, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves to (7,3), then next turn I can go down to (7,3) if the enemy is still there, but that would be a collision. So maybe I need to avoid that. Alternatively, if the enemy moves elsewhere, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (8,5) is safer. Then, next turn, I can move left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is safe. Let's check the board. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). So moving up to (8,5) doesn't get me an apple, but starts me on a path towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is a step towards two apples. But with some risk. But since the enemy is at (6,3), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right to (7,3), then (7,4) is adjacent. But if I move left to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy is at (7,3), I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where they are. So I would have to choose another direction. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards me. They might be going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So if I move left towards (7,4), and the enemy moves towards (7,2), then maybe we both are heading there, but I can get there first. Or maybe not.\n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's think about the immediate safety. Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe because there's no snake there. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So moving left is safe. Then, next turn, I can assess again. If the enemy moves towards (7,3), I can decide to go left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5), etc. So maybe moving left is the best option now to get closer to the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,5) is also safe. But that's moving away from the closer apple (7,2). So maybe not optimal.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Let's recheck:\n\nLEFT to (7,4): safe, closer to (7,2) and (4,5).\n\nDOWN to (8,3): safe, closer to (7,2).\n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is two steps from (8,4) if I go left then down. Or down then left. Both are three steps. Wait, from (8,4):\n\nLeft to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nDown to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nSame number of steps. But which path is safer?\n\nIf I go left first, then down, I might be closer to the enemy's position. If I go down first, then left, I'm moving into the same area but from a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards both apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is more likely to move towards (7,2) as well, so moving left first could get me there faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path for them.\n\nHmm. Since the enemy is at (6,3), the closest apple to them is (7,2) (distance of 1 right and 1 down) or (4,5) (distance of 2 left and 2 up). So the enemy might go for (7,2) first. So if I move left towards (7,4), I might be competing with the enemy for that apple. But if I can get there first, that's good. But if the enemy is closer, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy will move right to (7,3) next turn. Then, if I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2), but the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). Then, next turn, I can move left to (7,3), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. So that's also risky.\n\nHmm. So both options have risks. Maybe the safest move is to go UP to (8,5), which is away from the enemy and towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path, but safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,4) is safe, but not helpful. But maybe that's a way to avoid conflict.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is on the edge. Then, next turn, I can move up to (9,5), etc. But there's an apple at (9,9). That's five moves up. But maybe that's a path. But it's a long way. But if I can get there without competition, maybe it's worth it. But the enemy is at (6,3), so they are far from (9,9). So maybe that's a safer path. But it's a long way. But if I can collect that apple, it's a point. But it's risky because I have to move along the edge, which could be dangerous if the enemy comes that way. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is at (3,9). From (8,4), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Let's summarize:\n\nOptions:\n\n1. LEFT to (7,4): closer to apples but risk of enemy collision.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): closer to (7,2) but also risk.\n3. UP to (8,5): safer but longer path.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): edge, longer path.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect apples without dying, maybe the safest immediate move is UP. Because moving up takes me away from the enemy's current position and towards the apple at (4,5). Even though it's a longer path, it's safer. Then, next turn, I can plan to move left towards (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left is more aggressive towards apples but with higher risk.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), and their possible moves could be towards (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4), maybe moving left is risky. So perhaps UP is safer.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate safety. The current move: moving UP to (8,5) is safe. No snakes there, no walls. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is also safe. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So (7,4) is safe. So both LEFT and UP are safe moves.\n\nSo between those two, which is better. If I go left, I can start moving towards two apples. If I go up, I start moving towards one apple. So maybe left is better.\n\nBut the risk is that the enemy might move into the path. But since the enemy is a head with no body, they can move freely. So if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves right to (7,3), then next turn I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where the enemy is. So I would have to choose another direction, like left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5). But if I move left again to (6,4), then the enemy is at (7,3), so that's safe. Then, from (6,4), I can move left towards (5,4), etc., towards (4,5). So maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I move left to (6,4), I would collide. But the enemy's next move is unknown. So there's a risk.\n\nBut perhaps the potential reward of getting closer to apples is worth the risk. Since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe taking calculated risks is necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think moving LEFT to (7,4) is the best option. It gets me closer to two apples and starts me on a path towards them. The risk of collision with the enemy is present but manageable if I plan my next moves carefully.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points while avoiding risks, I'll move towards the nearest apple at (7,2) by heading left first. This positions me closer to multiple apples and avoids immediate danger from the enemy snake. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **DOWN (7,2)**: This is the location of an apple. If I move here, I eat the apple, grow, and gain a point. But I need to check if this is safe. The enemy is at (5,3). If they move right twice, they could reach (7,3) in two moves. But since they just moved to (5,3) last turn, their next move could be in any direction. However, moving down to (7,2) would immediately get the apple. The risk here is if the enemy is moving towards me. But their body is empty, so they can turn freely. If they move right to (6,3), then next turn they could be at (7,3), but I would already be at (7,2). So moving down seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **LEFT (6,3)**: This moves me closer to the enemy's current position (5,3). If the enemy moves right to (6,3), we could collide. Since their body is empty, they might be heading towards an apple. The apple at (4,5) is near them. Maybe they'll move up. But moving left here might risk collision if they move right. Not sure.\n\n3. **UP (7,4)**: This would take me back to where I was before. Not helpful unless avoiding a threat, but there's no immediate threat here. However, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2).\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving right doesn't lead towards any apples. The closest apple in that direction is (9,9), which is far. Not useful right now.\n\nThe best option seems to be moving DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. The enemy is at (5,3), so even if they move right once to (6,3), they can't reach (7,2) in one move. The next turn, if I'm at (7,2), I can consider moving left towards other apples or avoiding the enemy. Since the enemy's body is empty, they might be trying to get apples too. The apple at (4,5) is closer to them, so maybe they'll head there. \n\nAnother consideration: If I move down to (7,2), I need to check if that's a valid move.

Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (6,4)**: Moving up here doesn't lead directly to an apple. The closest apple in that direction is (4,5) which is two up and two left. Not immediately beneficial. Also, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2) which is just below my previous position.\n\n2. **DOWN (6,2)**: This would take me to (6,2). The apple at (7,2) is one step to the right. If I move down here, next turn I could go RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. But that delays getting the apple by a turn. However, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards that apple as well.\n\n3. **LEFT (5,3)**: Moving left towards (5,3) brings me closer to the enemy snake at (3,3). If the enemy moves right, they could reach (4,3) or (5,3) in two moves. But since their body is empty, they might be heading towards the apple at (4,5) by moving up. However, moving left here might risk collision if they move right towards me. For example, if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3) next, then I'm at (5,3), and they could move to (5,3) the following turn. But since their body is empty, they can turn freely. This seems risky.\n\n4. **RIGHT (7,3)**: Moving back to (7,3) where I was before. The apple at (7,2) is directly below that position. If I move RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn I can move DOWN to (7,2) to get the apple. But why not go directly towards the apple now? Wait, from (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) would allow me to then move DOWN to (7,2) next turn. However, if I move RIGHT now, I might be giving the enemy a chance to take the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2) next turn. But that's two moves to get the apple. Alternatively, if I move RIGHT now to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. That's two moves, but maybe safer.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,2) is still there. Let me check the board state again. The board shows at (7,2) there's an apple (A). So if I can reach it in one move, that's better. From (6,3), moving DOWN to (6,2) doesn't get me closer to (7,2). To reach (7,2), I need to move RIGHT to (7,3) then DOWN, or move RIGHT and then DOWN. Alternatively, from (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2). But that's two steps. Alternatively, is there a way to get there in one step? No, because from (6,3), moving RIGHT then DOWN is two steps. Wait, no. From (6,3), moving RIGHT takes me to (7,3). Then from there, moving DOWN takes me to (7,2). So two moves. Alternatively, if I move DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2), then RIGHT to (7,2). Also two moves. Either way, two moves to get the apple. But maybe the enemy snake is moving towards that apple as well. The enemy is at (3,3). To reach (7,2), they would need to move right four times and down once. That's five moves. So they are not an immediate threat for that apple. Therefore, perhaps it's safe to take the longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (6,3), moving LEFT twice and UP twice would get there. But that's a longer path. The apple at (0,8) is far to the left and up. The apple at (9,9) is top-right corner. The apple at (3,9) is top-left. So the closest apples are (7,2) and (4,5). \n\nSo the best immediate target is (7,2). To get there, I need to move RIGHT to (7,3) then DOWN. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now and then DOWN. But moving RIGHT now might be safe. Let's check for collision risks. The enemy is at (3,3). If they move RIGHT, they go to (4,3). Then again RIGHT to (5,3), etc. But they might be heading towards the apple at (4,5). To get to (4,5), they need to move UP twice and RIGHT once. So from (3,3), moving UP to (3,4), then UP to (3,5), then RIGHT to (4,5). So they might be moving up. Therefore, moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) is safe, as the enemy is moving up. \n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. That seems safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). But moving DOWN to (6,2) doesn't lead to any immediate apple. However, if I move DOWN to (6,2), then next turn RIGHT to (7,2) gets the apple. So that's two moves. But moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN next turn is also two moves. Either way, same number of steps. But moving RIGHT now might be better because it positions me closer to the apple. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT to (7,3) is adjacent to the apple at (7,2). So next turn, I can move DOWN to get it. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). Both are two moves. But moving RIGHT first might be better because it's a straight path. \n\nBut what if the enemy snake is moving towards (7,2)? If they are at (3,3), they need to move right four times and down once. That's five moves. So they can't reach it before me. Therefore, it's safe to take two moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better apple to target. The apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. From (6,3), moving LEFT twice and UP twice. That's four moves. But the apple at (7,2) is two moves. So (7,2) is better. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any immediate dangers? The enemy is at (3,3). Their possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. If they move RIGHT, they go to (4,3). If they move UP, they go to (3,4). If they move LEFT, they go to (2,3). If they move DOWN, they go to (3,2). Since their body is empty, they can choose any direction. But their goal is to get apples. The closest apple to them is (4,5), so they might move UP and RIGHT. So they might not be a threat to me immediately. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (7,3) seems safe. Then next turn, move DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (6,2) and then RIGHT. But moving RIGHT now is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) is safe. There's no snake there. The board shows that at (7,3), there's nothing. The enemy is at (3,3). So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,3) would bring me closer to the enemy. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3), then I'm at (5,3), which is still safe. But moving LEFT doesn't help me get any apples. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (7,3), setting up to get the apple at (7,2) next turn. That's the optimal path. \n\nAnother check: Are there any walls or other snakes in the direction? Moving RIGHT to (7,3) is within the 10x10 grid. No walls. No other snakes there. So it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) next turn to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: RIGHT**  \n**Rationale:** Moving right to (7,3) positions me to collect the apple at (7,2) next turn. The enemy at (3,3) is unlikely to interfere immediately, prioritizing their own path. This path avoids collision risks and secures the nearest apple efficiently. Next turn, plan to move DOWN to (7,2) for the point."

So possible moves from (6,2) are UP to (6,3), DOWN to (6,1), LEFT to (5,2), or RIGHT to (7,2). The apple at (7,2) is directly to the right. So moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collect the apple. That's the best move. But need to check for any dangers.\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (2,3) with body at []. Wait, in the initial problem, the enemy snakes positions are listed as \"Snake #2 is at position (2, 3) with body at []\". But in the board state, at y=3 (the row above), there's a 2 at (3,3). Wait, maybe there's a discrepancy. Let me check the board again.\n\nThe board state shows:\n\nRow 3 (y=3) is \". . 2 . . . . . . .\", which would be x=2, y=3. So snake #2 is at (2,3). But in the board's visual, the 2 is at (3,3). Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the user's description. Let me parse the board again.\n\nThe board is presented with y=9 at the top. The rows are labeled from 9 down to 0. The row labeled 3 (which is y=3) is:\n\n3 . . 2 . . . . . . .\n\nSo the columns are x=0 to x=9. So in row y=3, the 2 is at x=2, making the position (2,3). But in the enemy snake positions, it's stated as (2,3). So that's correct. So snake #2 is at (2,3). So their possible moves are UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3). \n\nSo from my current position (6,2), moving RIGHT to (7,2) would collect the apple there. That's the best move. No immediate threats from the enemy snake, as they are at (2,3), which is far away. Moving RIGHT to (7,2) is safe and gains a point. \n\nOther options: UP to (6,3) which is empty, but no apple. DOWN to (6,1), which is also empty. LEFT to (5,2), which doesn't lead to an apple. So RIGHT is the optimal move.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: RIGHT**  \n**Rationale:** Moving right to (7,2) immediately collects the apple, gaining a point. This is the shortest path with no collision risks. The enemy at (2,3) is too distant to interfere. Next, consider targeting the apple at (4,5) by moving left and up."

As we move left, we should monitor if Snake #1 is moving towards our position.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake is at (6,2) after moving RIGHT to collect the apple at (7,2). Now, the apples remaining are (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake #2 is at (2,3) with an empty body.\n\nPossible moves from (6,2) are UP to (6,3), DOWN to (6,1), LEFT to (5,2), or RIGHT to (7,2). But since I just moved RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple, that position is now part of my body. Wait, no\u2014when you collect an apple, you grow, so the tail extends. Wait, the rules say that if you move onto an apple, you grow. So after moving RIGHT to (7,2), the snake's head is now at (7,2), and the body would include the previous position (6,2). So the next move would be from (7,2). Wait, the user's last move information says that after moving RIGHT, the snake is now at (7,2). But according to the problem statement, the current position after the last move is (6,2). Wait, there's confusion here. Let me recheck.\n\nThe initial problem states that the snake is currently at (6,2) after the last move. The last move direction was RIGHT, which would have moved from (6,2) to (7,2). Wait, no\u2014if the snake was at (6,3) and moved DOWN to (6,2), then the next move would be from (6,2). But the user's last move information says that the direction was RIGHT, but the current position is (6,2). Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Let me clarify based on the given board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided, the snake is at (6,3) in the row labeled 3 (y=3). Wait, the board shows:\n\nRow 3 (y=3): . 2 . . . . 1 . . . \n\nWait, the x-coordinates are 0-9. So in row y=3, the snake 1 is at x=6, so (6,3). But the problem states the snake is currently at (6,2). This inconsistency is confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (6, 3)\"\n\nBut in the board state, the row labeled 3 (y=3) shows snake 1 at (6,3). Then the last move was direction UP, which would have moved from (6,2) to (6,3). So the current position is (6,3). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). Enemy snake #2 is at (1,3) with body at []. Wait, the enemy positions say Snake #2 is at (1,3), but in the board state, at y=3, there's a 2 at x=1, which is (1,3). So that's correct.\n\nSo from (6,3), possible moves are UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), or RIGHT to (7,3). The apple at (7,2) is one step down and right. But moving RIGHT to (7,3) doesn't reach it. To get to (7,2), the snake would need to move DOWN and RIGHT, but that's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). But since the snake is at (6,3), moving DOWN to (6,2) would be possible. However, the apple at (7,2) is adjacent to (6,2) if the snake moves RIGHT from there. But in the current position (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) doesn't collect any apple. The closest apples are (4,5) and (3,9). \n\nLooking at the apples, (4,5) is to the left and up. From (6,3), moving LEFT to (5,3), then UP to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5). But that's longer. The apple at (3,9) is far to the left and up. The apple at (0,8) is even further left, and (9,9) is top-right corner.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake at (1,3), which is far left. They might be heading towards (0,8) apple. But their path is unclear. \n\nThe safest move would be to head towards the nearest apple, which is (4,5). To get there, moving LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3), then UP to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5). Alternatively, moving UP first to (6,4), then LEFT. But moving LEFT first might be better to start approaching the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,4) is safe, as there's no immediate threat. Then from there, continue towards (4,5). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (7,3) is safe, but no apple there. Then from (7,3), moving DOWN to (7,2) to collect the apple. But that would take two moves. However, if another snake is approaching (7,2), they might take it first. But currently, enemy snake is at (1,3), so they are far away. \n\nSo the best immediate move is to start heading towards (4,5). Moving LEFT to (5,3) is a step in that direction. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,4) to get closer to (4,5) via a different path. \n\nNeed to check for any obstacles. From (6,3), moving LEFT to (5,3) is safe. The enemy is at (1,3), which is four steps left. So no collision. Moving UP to (6,4) is also safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) would allow collecting the apple at (7,2) next turn by moving RIGHT. But moving DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) is safe. Then next move RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. That's a two-step plan but ensures collecting the apple. \n\nComparing the two options: \n\n1. Move LEFT to (5,3) towards (4,5). \n2. Move DOWN to (6,2) then RIGHT to (7,2). \n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is closer in steps (two moves) but requires moving down first. The apple at (4,5) is further but may have less competition. \n\nSince the enemy snake is at (1,3), they might not be heading towards (7,2). So moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2) is a safe way to collect that apple. \n\nBut wait, the current position is (6,3). Moving DOWN to (6,2) is allowed. Then next turn, move RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. That's a valid plan. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) doesn't collect an apple but positions closer to (9,9) which is far. \n\nSo the best immediate move is DOWN to (6,2), setting up to collect the apple at (7,2) next turn. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (7,2) is still present. So moving RIGHT from (6,2) would collect it. But the snake is currently at (6,3). So moving DOWN to (6,2) is safe, and then next turn RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) to collect the apple. That's two moves as well. \n\nBut which path is safer? Moving DOWN first avoids potential conflicts. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) next turn. Both paths are two steps. \n\nBut moving DOWN first to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2) is more direct. \n\nHowever, the snake's body after moving DOWN would be at (6,3) and (6,2). Then moving RIGHT to (7,2) would extend the body. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) would also work. \n\nBut which is better? The apple at (7,2) is still there, so either path works. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake could interfere. But since the enemy is at (1,3), they are far away. \n\nSo the best move is DOWN to (6,2), then RIGHT to (7,2) next turn. \n\nBut wait, the current move is only for the next step. So the immediate decision is which direction to choose now. \n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (6,2), that's safe. Then next turn, move RIGHT to (7,2) to collect the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) doesn't collect an apple but positions closer to other apples. \n\nBut since the apple at (7,2) is adjacent to (6,2), moving DOWN now and then RIGHT next turn is a good plan. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be DOWN to (6,2). \n\nWait, but the snake is currently at (6,3). Moving DOWN to (6,2) is allowed. Then next turn, RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. \n\nYes, that's a valid strategy. \n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to collect the apple. \n\nBoth options take two moves to collect the apple. \n\nBut moving DOWN first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) would also work. \n\nBut which direction is better now? \n\nSince the apple is at (7,2), moving RIGHT now to (7,3) doesn't help immediately. Moving DOWN to (6,2) allows collecting the apple next turn. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (6,2). \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (6,3). Moving DOWN to (6,2) is safe. Then next turn, RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. \n\nYes, that's a solid plan. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) next turn. \n\nBut why not collect the apple in two moves either way. \n\nBut moving DOWN first allows the snake to be closer to the apple, reducing the risk of another snake taking it. \n\nBut in this scenario, the enemy snake is at (1,3), which is far away. So the apple at (7,2) is safe to collect in two moves. \n\nTherefore, the best immediate move is DOWN to (6,2). \n\nWait, but the user's last move information says that the last direction was UP, which would have moved from (6,2) to (6,3). So the current position is (6,3). \n\nTherefore, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nMoving DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) is allowed. \n\nYes. So the next move should be DOWN to (6,2), setting up to collect the apple at (7,2) next turn. \n\nTherefore, the direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: DOWN**  \n**Rationale:** Moving down to (6,2) positions the snake to collect the apple at (7,2) on the next move. This path is safe with no immediate threats from the distant enemy snake. Next turn, plan to move RIGHT to secure the apple and grow."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (8,4). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (6,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the possible moves. From (8,4), possible directions are UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). But I have to check if those moves are safe and lead to apples or not.\n\nLooking at the apples: The closest ones are (7,2) which is two left and two down from my current position. But that's a bit far. (4,5) is left four and up one. (0,8) is way left and up, but that's a long path. (9,9) is top right corner, but moving right from (8,4) would take me to (9,4), then up. But maybe that's a longer path. (3,9) is up and left, but again, maybe not the closest.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left again to (6,4), then left to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's five moves. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, if I go up first. Let's see: If I go UP to (8,5), then left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is not an apple. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is closer. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But that's a possible path. But moving left first would take me to (7,4), which is safe? Let's check the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). So (7,4) is not adjacent to the enemy. So moving left to (7,4) is safe. Then down to (7,3), then (7,2) to get the apple. But that's three moves. But maybe I can get that apple if I plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,9) is the top right. If I go right to (9,4), then up. But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option right now.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is on the left top. That's a long way, probably not worth it yet. The apple at (3,9) is also top left. So maybe the closest apples are (4,5) and (7,2).\n\nBut let's check the immediate next move. What's the safest direction? Let's check each possible direction:\n\nUP: (8,5). Is that a safe square? The board shows that at (4,5) there's an apple, but (8,5) is empty. No snakes there. The enemy is at (6,3), so (8,5) is safe. Moving up would take me towards the apple at (4,5) but that's a longer path. But maybe moving up is a safe direction.\n\nDOWN: (8,3). Is that safe? The enemy is at (6,3), which is two to the left. So (8,3) is two to the right of the enemy. So that's safe. But moving down from (8,4) to (8,3) would be okay. But where's the nearest apple? The apple at (7,2) is down and left. So moving down to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). That's three moves. But maybe that's a path.\n\nLEFT: (7,4). That's adjacent to the current position. Is there any danger here? The enemy is at (6,3), which is one left and one down from (7,4). So (7,4) is safe. Moving left here would get me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I then go down. Also, moving left could lead towards the apple at (4,5) if I go up later. So left might be a good option.\n\nRIGHT: (9,4). That's the edge of the board. Moving right here would take me to (9,4), which is safe (no walls yet, since the board is 0-9). But then I'm on the edge. From there, maybe up towards (9,9), but that's a long way. Not sure if that's the best move.\n\nSo possible options: LEFT towards (7,4) to get closer to (7,2) or (4,5), UP towards (8,5) to maybe go towards (4,5), DOWN to (8,3) towards (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,4) which is edge.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3). If I move left to (7,4), the enemy is at (6,3). So they could move up, right, or down. If they move right, they go to (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4). But since their body is empty, they can move freely. But since they are at (6,3), their possible moves are up to (6,4), right to (7,3), down to (6,2), or left to (5,3). So if I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn, which is adjacent. But since I'm at (7,4), if the enemy moves to (7,3), then I could be in a position where I can go down to (7,3) and collide with them. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So moving left towards (7,4) might put me in a path that the enemy is also moving towards. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2). But then, the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). So that's two squares apart. Not a collision risk immediately. But maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,5) would take me towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer in terms of avoiding the enemy.\n\nWait, the apple at (4,5) is in the middle. From (8,4), moving left four times and up once. But maybe that's a path. But moving left first would be better. Let's see: If I go left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), then left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). That's four moves. But each left move is safe as long as there's no obstacles. The enemy is at (6,3), so (6,4) is safe. But maybe the enemy could move up to (6,4) in their next move. So if I go to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I go to (6,4), I might collide. Hmm, that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going up first. If I go up to (8,5), then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,2) is the closest. Let's calculate the distance. From (8,4) to (7,2): that's two left and two down. So Manhattan distance is 4. The apple at (4,5) is four left and one up, Manhattan distance 5. So (7,2) is closer. So maybe prioritize that.\n\nSo to get to (7,2), the path would be left to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But need to check if those squares are safe. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I move to (7,4), the enemy could move to (7,3) next turn. If that happens, then when I try to go down to (7,3), I would collide with the enemy. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left first is risky if the enemy moves towards (7,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. From (8,4) to (8,3). Then left to (7,3), then left to (6,3) which is where the enemy is. Wait, that's a problem. Because moving left from (8,3) to (7,3) would be adjacent to the enemy's current position (6,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's also a risk.\n\nHmm. So maybe the safest path is to go towards the apple at (4,5). Let's see. From (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then left to (6,4), left to (5,4), left to (4,4), then up to (4,5). But each step, need to check for safety. The enemy is at (6,3). So when I'm at (7,4), the enemy could move up to (6,4), which is adjacent to (7,4). So if I then move left to (6,4), I might collide if the enemy is there. But maybe the enemy is going for other apples. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is heading towards (7,2) as well. So perhaps the enemy's next move is down to (6,2) to get closer to (7,2). Or right to (7,3). So if the enemy moves right to (7,3), then when I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up first. From (8,4) to (8,5). Then left to (7,5), then left to (6,5), etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe safer. The enemy is at (6,3), so moving up to (8,5) is away from the enemy. Then, moving left towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,9) is possible. But that's a long way. From (8,4), moving right to (9,4), then up to (9,5), (9,6), etc. But that's 5 moves up. Not sure if that's worth it.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake's body is empty, so it's just the head. So if I can get to a position where the enemy might collide with me, but since they are just a head, maybe they can't block me unless they move into my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to go left towards (7,4), which is closer to the apple at (7,2) and (4,5). But need to assess the risk of collision with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to (8,3) to get closer to (7,2). Let's see: from (8,3), next move could be left to (7,3), then down to (7,2). But the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then when I move left to (7,3), I collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving down is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,4). That's the edge. Then, moving up. But that's not towards any apple immediately. Unless there's an apple at (9,9). But that's a long way. So maybe not the best move.\n\nSo considering all options, perhaps the best move is LEFT to (7,4). That gets me closer to both (7,2) and (4,5). The risk is that the enemy might move into (7,3) or (6,4), but I can adjust next turn. For example, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves to (7,3), then next turn I can go down to (7,3) if the enemy is still there, but that would be a collision. So maybe I need to avoid that. Alternatively, if the enemy moves elsewhere, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (8,5) is safer. Then, next turn, I can move left towards (4,5). But (8,5) is safe. Let's check the board. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). So moving up to (8,5) doesn't get me an apple, but starts me on a path towards (4,5). But that's a longer path. But maybe safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is a step towards two apples. But with some risk. But since the enemy is at (6,3), their possible moves are up, down, left, right. If they move right to (7,3), then (7,4) is adjacent. But if I move left to (7,4), then next turn, if the enemy is at (7,3), I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where they are. So I would have to choose another direction. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards me. They might be going for the apple at (7,2) as well. So if I move left towards (7,4), and the enemy moves towards (7,2), then maybe we both are heading there, but I can get there first. Or maybe not.\n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's think about the immediate safety. Moving LEFT to (7,4) is safe because there's no snake there. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So moving left is safe. Then, next turn, I can assess again. If the enemy moves towards (7,3), I can decide to go left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5), etc. So maybe moving left is the best option now to get closer to the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,5) is also safe. But that's moving away from the closer apple (7,2). So maybe not optimal.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. Let's recheck:\n\nLEFT to (7,4): safe, closer to (7,2) and (4,5).\n\nDOWN to (8,3): safe, closer to (7,2).\n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is two steps from (8,4) if I go left then down. Or down then left. Both are three steps. Wait, from (8,4):\n\nLeft to (7,4), then down to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nDown to (8,3), then left to (7,3), then down to (7,2): three moves.\n\nSame number of steps. But which path is safer?\n\nIf I go left first, then down, I might be closer to the enemy's position. If I go down first, then left, I'm moving into the same area but from a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left first is better because it's a step towards both apples. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is more likely to move towards (7,2) as well, so moving left first could get me there faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path for them.\n\nHmm. Since the enemy is at (6,3), the closest apple to them is (7,2) (distance of 1 right and 1 down) or (4,5) (distance of 2 left and 2 up). So the enemy might go for (7,2) first. So if I move left towards (7,4), I might be competing with the enemy for that apple. But if I can get there first, that's good. But if the enemy is closer, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy will move right to (7,3) next turn. Then, if I'm at (7,4), I can move down to (7,3) and collide. So that's a risk. So maybe moving left is risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,3) would take me closer to (7,2), but the enemy is at (6,3). If they move right to (7,3), then I'm at (8,3). Then, next turn, I can move left to (7,3), but that's where the enemy is. So that's a collision. So that's also risky.\n\nHmm. So both options have risks. Maybe the safest move is to go UP to (8,5), which is away from the enemy and towards the apple at (4,5). But that's a longer path, but safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,4) is safe, but not helpful. But maybe that's a way to avoid conflict.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,4) is on the edge. Then, next turn, I can move up to (9,5), etc. But there's an apple at (9,9). That's five moves up. But maybe that's a path. But it's a long way. But if I can get there without competition, maybe it's worth it. But the enemy is at (6,3), so they are far from (9,9). So maybe that's a safer path. But it's a long way. But if I can collect that apple, it's a point. But it's risky because I have to move along the edge, which could be dangerous if the enemy comes that way. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (3,9) is at (3,9). From (8,4), moving left and up. But that's a long way. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Let's summarize:\n\nOptions:\n\n1. LEFT to (7,4): closer to apples but risk of enemy collision.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): closer to (7,2) but also risk.\n3. UP to (8,5): safer but longer path.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): edge, longer path.\n\nGiven that the goal is to collect apples without dying, maybe the safest immediate move is UP. Because moving up takes me away from the enemy's current position and towards the apple at (4,5). Even though it's a longer path, it's safer. Then, next turn, I can plan to move left towards (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving left is more aggressive towards apples but with higher risk.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), and their possible moves could be towards (7,3), which is adjacent to (7,4), maybe moving left is risky. So perhaps UP is safer.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate safety. The current move: moving UP to (8,5) is safe. No snakes there, no walls. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,4) is also safe. The enemy is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. So (7,4) is safe. So both LEFT and UP are safe moves.\n\nSo between those two, which is better. If I go left, I can start moving towards two apples. If I go up, I start moving towards one apple. So maybe left is better.\n\nBut the risk is that the enemy might move into the path. But since the enemy is a head with no body, they can move freely. So if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves right to (7,3), then next turn I can't move down to (7,3) because that's where the enemy is. So I would have to choose another direction, like left again to (6,4) or up to (7,5). But if I move left again to (6,4), then the enemy is at (7,3), so that's safe. Then, from (6,4), I can move left towards (5,4), etc., towards (4,5). So maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,4), and the enemy moves up to (6,4), then when I move left to (6,4), I would collide. But the enemy's next move is unknown. So there's a risk.\n\nBut perhaps the potential reward of getting closer to apples is worth the risk. Since the goal is to collect as many apples as possible, maybe taking calculated risks is necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think moving LEFT to (7,4) is the best option. It gets me closer to two apples and starts me on a path towards them. The risk of collision with the enemy is present but manageable if I plan my next moves carefully.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points while avoiding risks, I'll move towards the nearest apple at (7,2) by heading left first. This positions me closer to multiple apples and avoids immediate danger from the enemy snake. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **DOWN (7,2)**: This is the location of an apple. If I move here, I eat the apple, grow, and gain a point. But I need to check if this is safe. The enemy is at (5,3). If they move right twice, they could reach (7,3) in two moves. But since they just moved to (5,3) last turn, their next move could be in any direction. However, moving down to (7,2) would immediately get the apple. The risk here is if the enemy is moving towards me. But their body is empty, so they can turn freely. If they move right to (6,3), then next turn they could be at (7,3), but I would already be at (7,2). So moving down seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **LEFT (6,3)**: This moves me closer to the enemy's current position (5,3). If the enemy moves right to (6,3), we could collide. Since their body is empty, they might be heading towards an apple. The apple at (4,5) is near them. Maybe they'll move up. But moving left here might risk collision if they move right. Not sure.\n\n3. **UP (7,4)**: This would take me back to where I was before. Not helpful unless avoiding a threat, but there's no immediate threat here. However, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2).\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moving right doesn't lead towards any apples. The closest apple in that direction is (9,9), which is far. Not useful right now.\n\nThe best option seems to be moving DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. The enemy is at (5,3), so even if they move right once to (6,3), they can't reach (7,2) in one move. The next turn, if I'm at (7,2), I can consider moving left towards other apples or avoiding the enemy. Since the enemy's body is empty, they might be trying to get apples too. The apple at (4,5) is closer to them, so maybe they'll head there. \n\nAnother consideration: If I move down to (7,2), I need to check if that's a valid move.

Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP (6,4)**: Moving up here doesn't lead directly to an apple. The closest apple in that direction is (4,5) which is two up and two left. Not immediately beneficial. Also, moving up might take me away from the apple at (7,2) which is just below my previous position.\n\n2. **DOWN (6,2)**: This would take me to (6,2). The apple at (7,2) is one step to the right. If I move down here, next turn I could go RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. But that delays getting the apple by a turn. However, maybe there's a risk of the enemy snake moving towards that apple as well.\n\n3. **LEFT (5,3)**: Moving left towards (5,3) brings me closer to the enemy snake at (3,3). If the enemy moves right, they could reach (4,3) or (5,3) in two moves. But since their body is empty, they might be heading towards the apple at (4,5) by moving up. However, moving left here might risk collision if they move right towards me. For example, if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3) next, then I'm at (5,3), and they could move to (5,3) the following turn. But since their body is empty, they can turn freely. This seems risky.\n\n4. **RIGHT (7,3)**: Moving back to (7,3) where I was before. The apple at (7,2) is directly below that position. If I move RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn I can move DOWN to (7,2) to get the apple. But why not go directly towards the apple now? Wait, from (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) would allow me to then move DOWN to (7,2) next turn. However, if I move RIGHT now, I might be giving the enemy a chance to take the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2) next turn. But that's two moves to get the apple. Alternatively, if I move RIGHT now to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. That's two moves, but maybe safer.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,2) is still there. Let me check the board state again. The board shows at (7,2) there's an apple (A). So if I can reach it in one move, that's better. From (6,3), moving DOWN to (6,2) doesn't get me closer to (7,2). To reach (7,2), I need to move RIGHT to (7,3) then DOWN, or move RIGHT and then DOWN. Alternatively, from (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2). But that's two steps. Alternatively, is there a way to get there in one step? No, because from (6,3), moving RIGHT then DOWN is two steps. Wait, no. From (6,3), moving RIGHT takes me to (7,3). Then from there, moving DOWN takes me to (7,2). So two moves. Alternatively, if I move DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2), then RIGHT to (7,2). Also two moves. Either way, two moves to get the apple. But maybe the enemy snake is moving towards that apple as well. The enemy is at (3,3). To reach (7,2), they would need to move right four times and down once. That's five moves. So they are not an immediate threat for that apple. Therefore, perhaps it's safe to take the longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple closer. The apple at (4,5) is at (4,5). From (6,3), moving LEFT twice and UP twice would get there. But that's a longer path. The apple at (0,8) is far to the left and up. The apple at (9,9) is top-right corner. The apple at (3,9) is top-left. So the closest apples are (7,2) and (4,5). \n\nSo the best immediate target is (7,2). To get there, I need to move RIGHT to (7,3) then DOWN. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now and then DOWN. But moving RIGHT now might be safe. Let's check for collision risks. The enemy is at (3,3). If they move RIGHT, they go to (4,3). Then again RIGHT to (5,3), etc. But they might be heading towards the apple at (4,5). To get to (4,5), they need to move UP twice and RIGHT once. So from (3,3), moving UP to (3,4), then UP to (3,5), then RIGHT to (4,5). So they might be moving up. Therefore, moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) is safe, as the enemy is moving up. \n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. That seems safe. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). But moving DOWN to (6,2) doesn't lead to any immediate apple. However, if I move DOWN to (6,2), then next turn RIGHT to (7,2) gets the apple. So that's two moves. But moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN next turn is also two moves. Either way, same number of steps. But moving RIGHT now might be better because it positions me closer to the apple. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT to (7,3) is adjacent to the apple at (7,2). So next turn, I can move DOWN to get it. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). Both are two moves. But moving RIGHT first might be better because it's a straight path. \n\nBut what if the enemy snake is moving towards (7,2)? If they are at (3,3), they need to move right four times and down once. That's five moves. So they can't reach it before me. Therefore, it's safe to take two moves to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better apple to target. The apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. From (6,3), moving LEFT twice and UP twice. That's four moves. But the apple at (7,2) is two moves. So (7,2) is better. \n\nAnother consideration: Are there any immediate dangers? The enemy is at (3,3). Their possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. If they move RIGHT, they go to (4,3). If they move UP, they go to (3,4). If they move LEFT, they go to (2,3). If they move DOWN, they go to (3,2). Since their body is empty, they can choose any direction. But their goal is to get apples. The closest apple to them is (4,5), so they might move UP and RIGHT. So they might not be a threat to me immediately. \n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (7,3) seems safe. Then next turn, move DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN now to (6,2) and then RIGHT. But moving RIGHT now is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) is safe. There's no snake there. The board shows that at (7,3), there's nothing. The enemy is at (3,3). So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,3) would bring me closer to the enemy. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3), then I'm at (5,3), which is still safe. But moving LEFT doesn't help me get any apples. \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to (7,3), setting up to get the apple at (7,2) next turn. That's the optimal path. \n\nAnother check: Are there any walls or other snakes in the direction? Moving RIGHT to (7,3) is within the 10x10 grid. No walls. No other snakes there. So it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be RIGHT to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) next turn to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: RIGHT**  \n**Rationale:** Moving right to (7,3) positions me to collect the apple at (7,2) next turn. The enemy at (3,3) is unlikely to interfere immediately, prioritizing their own path. This path avoids collision risks and secures the nearest apple efficiently. Next turn, plan to move DOWN to (7,2) for the point."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the current situation. My snake is at (6,2) after moving RIGHT to collect the apple at (7,2). Now, the apples remaining are (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). The enemy snake #2 is at (2,3) with an empty body.\n\nPossible moves from (6,2) are UP to (6,3), DOWN to (6,1), LEFT to (5,2), or RIGHT to (7,2). But since I just moved RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple, that position is now part of my body. Wait, no\u2014when you collect an apple, you grow, so the tail extends. Wait, the rules say that if you move onto an apple, you grow. So after moving RIGHT to (7,2), the snake's head is now at (7,2), and the body would include the previous position (6,2). So the next move would be from (7,2). Wait, the user's last move information says that after moving RIGHT, the snake is now at (7,2). But according to the problem statement, the current position after the last move is (6,2). Wait, there's confusion here. Let me recheck.\n\nThe initial problem states that the snake is currently at (6,2) after the last move. The last move direction was RIGHT, which would have moved from (6,2) to (7,2). Wait, no\u2014if the snake was at (6,3) and moved DOWN to (6,2), then the next move would be from (6,2). But the user's last move information says that the direction was RIGHT, but the current position is (6,2). Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Let me clarify based on the given board state.\n\nLooking at the board state provided, the snake is at (6,3) in the row labeled 3 (y=3). Wait, the board shows:\n\nRow 3 (y=3): . 2 . . . . 1 . . . \n\nWait, the x-coordinates are 0-9. So in row y=3, the snake 1 is at x=6, so (6,3). But the problem states the snake is currently at (6,2). This inconsistency is confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (6, 3)\"\n\nBut in the board state, the row labeled 3 (y=3) shows snake 1 at (6,3). Then the last move was direction UP, which would have moved from (6,2) to (6,3). So the current position is (6,3). The apples are at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). Enemy snake #2 is at (1,3) with body at []. Wait, the enemy positions say Snake #2 is at (1,3), but in the board state, at y=3, there's a 2 at x=1, which is (1,3). So that's correct.\n\nSo from (6,3), possible moves are UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), or RIGHT to (7,3). The apple at (7,2) is one step down and right. But moving RIGHT to (7,3) doesn't reach it. To get to (7,2), the snake would need to move DOWN and RIGHT, but that's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2). But since the snake is at (6,3), moving DOWN to (6,2) would be possible. However, the apple at (7,2) is adjacent to (6,2) if the snake moves RIGHT from there. But in the current position (6,3), moving RIGHT to (7,3) doesn't collect any apple. The closest apples are (4,5) and (3,9). \n\nLooking at the apples, (4,5) is to the left and up. From (6,3), moving LEFT to (5,3), then UP to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5). That's three moves. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5). But that's longer. The apple at (3,9) is far to the left and up. The apple at (0,8) is even further left, and (9,9) is top-right corner.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake at (1,3), which is far left. They might be heading towards (0,8) apple. But their path is unclear. \n\nThe safest move would be to head towards the nearest apple, which is (4,5). To get there, moving LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3), then UP to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5). Alternatively, moving UP first to (6,4), then LEFT. But moving LEFT first might be better to start approaching the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,4) is safe, as there's no immediate threat. Then from there, continue towards (4,5). \n\nAnother consideration: moving RIGHT to (7,3) is safe, but no apple there. Then from (7,3), moving DOWN to (7,2) to collect the apple. But that would take two moves. However, if another snake is approaching (7,2), they might take it first. But currently, enemy snake is at (1,3), so they are far away. \n\nSo the best immediate move is to start heading towards (4,5). Moving LEFT to (5,3) is a step in that direction. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,4) to get closer to (4,5) via a different path. \n\nNeed to check for any obstacles. From (6,3), moving LEFT to (5,3) is safe. The enemy is at (1,3), which is four steps left. So no collision. Moving UP to (6,4) is also safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) would allow collecting the apple at (7,2) next turn by moving RIGHT. But moving DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) is safe. Then next move RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. That's a two-step plan but ensures collecting the apple. \n\nComparing the two options: \n\n1. Move LEFT to (5,3) towards (4,5). \n2. Move DOWN to (6,2) then RIGHT to (7,2). \n\nWhich is better? The apple at (7,2) is closer in steps (two moves) but requires moving down first. The apple at (4,5) is further but may have less competition. \n\nSince the enemy snake is at (1,3), they might not be heading towards (7,2). So moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2) is a safe way to collect that apple. \n\nBut wait, the current position is (6,3). Moving DOWN to (6,2) is allowed. Then next turn, move RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. That's a valid plan. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) doesn't collect an apple but positions closer to (9,9) which is far. \n\nSo the best immediate move is DOWN to (6,2), setting up to collect the apple at (7,2) next turn. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (7,2) is still present. So moving RIGHT from (6,2) would collect it. But the snake is currently at (6,3). So moving DOWN to (6,2) is safe, and then next turn RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) to collect the apple. That's two moves as well. \n\nBut which path is safer? Moving DOWN first avoids potential conflicts. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) next turn. Both paths are two steps. \n\nBut moving DOWN first to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (7,2) is more direct. \n\nHowever, the snake's body after moving DOWN would be at (6,3) and (6,2). Then moving RIGHT to (7,2) would extend the body. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) would also work. \n\nBut which is better? The apple at (7,2) is still there, so either path works. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it's a direct path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake could interfere. But since the enemy is at (1,3), they are far away. \n\nSo the best move is DOWN to (6,2), then RIGHT to (7,2) next turn. \n\nBut wait, the current move is only for the next step. So the immediate decision is which direction to choose now. \n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (6,2), that's safe. Then next turn, move RIGHT to (7,2) to collect the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) doesn't collect an apple but positions closer to other apples. \n\nBut since the apple at (7,2) is adjacent to (6,2), moving DOWN now and then RIGHT next turn is a good plan. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be DOWN to (6,2). \n\nWait, but the snake is currently at (6,3). Moving DOWN to (6,2) is allowed. Then next turn, RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. \n\nYes, that's a valid strategy. \n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves RIGHT to (7,3), then next turn DOWN to (7,2) to collect the apple. \n\nBoth options take two moves to collect the apple. \n\nBut moving DOWN first might be better because it's a direct path towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) would also work. \n\nBut which direction is better now? \n\nSince the apple is at (7,2), moving RIGHT now to (7,3) doesn't help immediately. Moving DOWN to (6,2) allows collecting the apple next turn. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (6,2). \n\nBut wait, the snake's current position is (6,3). Moving DOWN to (6,2) is safe. Then next turn, RIGHT to (7,2) to get the apple. \n\nYes, that's a solid plan. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) next turn. \n\nBut why not collect the apple in two moves either way. \n\nBut moving DOWN first allows the snake to be closer to the apple, reducing the risk of another snake taking it. \n\nBut in this scenario, the enemy snake is at (1,3), which is far away. So the apple at (7,2) is safe to collect in two moves. \n\nTherefore, the best immediate move is DOWN to (6,2). \n\nWait, but the user's last move information says that the last direction was UP, which would have moved from (6,2) to (6,3). So the current position is (6,3). \n\nTherefore, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nMoving DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) is allowed. \n\nYes. So the next move should be DOWN to (6,2), setting up to collect the apple at (7,2) next turn. \n\nTherefore, the direction is DOWN.\n</think>\n\n**Direction: DOWN**  \n**Rationale:** Moving down to (6,2) positions the snake to collect the apple at (7,2) on the next move. This path is safe with no immediate threats from the distant enemy snake. Next turn, plan to move RIGHT to secure the apple and grow."

Wait, no\u2014the apples listed now are (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). Wait, the initial problem said apples at (7,2), (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9). But after the last move, the snake collected the apple at (7,2), so it's no longer there. So the remaining apples are the other four. \n\nSo the apples now are (0,8), (9,9), (4,5), (3,9).
