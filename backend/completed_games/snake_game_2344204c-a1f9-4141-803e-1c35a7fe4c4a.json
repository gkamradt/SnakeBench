Consider decreasing the x-coordinate (LEFT) to make an immediate move closer to the apple at (0, 5), but still establish strategic positioning.\n2. Alternatively, increase the x-coordinate (RIGHT) and approach the target at (8, 9).\n\nSince moving RIGHT towards (8, 9) positions us more centrally and avoids possible obstacles like the enemy snake, let's choose this move.

Alternatively, increase the x-coordinate (RIGHT) and approach the target at (8, 9).\n\nSince moving RIGHT towards (8, 9) positions us more centrally and avoids possible obstacles like the enemy snake, let's choose this move.

Consider decreasing the x-coordinate (LEFT) to make an immediate move closer to the apple at (0, 5), but still establish strategic positioning.\n2. Alternatively, increase the x-coordinate (RIGHT) and approach the target at (8, 9).\n\nSince moving RIGHT towards (8, 9) positions us more centrally and avoids possible obstacles like the enemy snake, let's choose this move.
