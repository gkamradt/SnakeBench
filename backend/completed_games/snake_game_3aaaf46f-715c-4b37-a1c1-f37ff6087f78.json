The next options will be limited because I will be on the top row (y=9), where movements can only go DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT to evade any enemy snake that might try to flank me from below.

Collect the apple by moving UP to (8, 9).\n2. After that, I will evaluate my next best move while being mindful of the enemy snake's position at (5, 1) and plan to avoid confrontation while still moving toward other apples to maximize my points.\n\nDecided next move: **UP**."

From (7, 9), I can then either go UP to reach (7, 10) (which is out of bounds) or LEFT to (6, 9) if I need to continue reducing my x coordinate for tactical reasons.\n\nIn terms of strategy for the next turn:\n1. Move LEFT to (7, 9).\n2. Assess the situation from (7, 9) for my next move.\n3.
