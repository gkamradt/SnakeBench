My snake's tail is at (6,7).\n\nMy immediate options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n*   **UP:** Moves me to (6, 8), which is empty.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves me to (6, 6), which is empty.\n*   **LEFT:** Moves me to (5, 7), which is empty.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves me to (7, 7), which is empty.\n\nLet's consider the apple positions and the enemy snake.\nThe apples are at (2, 9), (4, 8), (8, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6).\nThe enemy snake is at (7, 4).\n\nIf I go UP to (6, 8), the closest apple would be (4,8) or (7,8).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 6), the closest apple would be (7,6) or (8,4).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7), the closest apple would be (4,8) or (2,9).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 7), the closest apple would be (7,8) or (7,6).\n\nGoing RIGHT seems like a good option since there are two apples at x=7. Let's go RIGHT.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (7,7), evaluate the new board state. Prioritize apples that are closer and avoid the enemy snake.\n\nFinal Answer:\nRIGHT"
