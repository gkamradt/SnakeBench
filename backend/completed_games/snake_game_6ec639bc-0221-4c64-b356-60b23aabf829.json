For the next move, continuing to the LEFT would place me a step away from the apple. Also, the enemy snake's body currently blocks the path to the apple at (5,4), so getting that apple is not immediately feasible. A potential risk is the apple at (0,9) because it is near the edge of the board, and I have to be careful not to run into the wall.\n\nStrategy for the next move: Proceed to the LEFT to approach the apple at (4,9). Observe the movement of Snake #1 to avoid any collision. Once the way is clear, target the apple at (5,4) next. Always keep an eye on the location of the other apples and adjust the strategy to collect the closest ones while maintaining a safe distance from the walls and enemy snakes.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
