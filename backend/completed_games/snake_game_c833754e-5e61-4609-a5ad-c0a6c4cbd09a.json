            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (1,3). There are apples at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), and (3,6). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,9) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . 1 . A . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . A . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere '.' is empty, '1' is enemy snake #1, '2' is my snake, and 'A' is an apple.\n\nSo, my position is (1,3), which is in row 3, column 1. There's an apple at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider the positions of the enemy snake and any potential dangers.\n\nLet's list out the apples and their positions:\n\n1. (2,1)\n\n2. (5,3)\n\n3. (5,9)\n\n4. (5,2)\n\n5. (3,6)\n\nHmm, I should think about which one is closest to my current position. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple, since we can only move up, down, left, right.\n\nMy position: (1,3)\n\n- To (2,1): |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (5,3): |5-1| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- To (5,9): |5-1| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (5,2): |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (3,6): |3-1| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,9), which is fairly far from my current position and the closest apple.\n\nMoreover, I should check if there are any obstacles or potential collisions on the path to the apple at (2,1).\n\nFrom (1,3), to get to (2,1), I need to move right to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then down to (2,1).\n\nLet's see the board:\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (2,2): empty\n\n- (2,1): apple\n\nLooks clear. No enemy snakes or other obstacles in the way.\n\nWait, but there's another apple at (5,3), which is directly below me at (5,3), but that's further away with a distance of 4.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) and (5,9) are even farther.\n\n(3,6) is also fairly far.\n\nSo, seems like going for (2,1) is the best option.\n\nBut, I should also think about what happens after I eat this apple. Will I be able to reach another apple easily afterward?\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nLet me think about the path after eating (2,1).\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my snake will be longer, so I need to make sure that the tail doesn't block my path.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, and assuming I'm only one segment long, after eating the apple, I become two segments.\n\nBut in Snake games, typically, the tail moves forward as you eat apples, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this simple case, I think I can manage.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movement. Although it's currently at (3,9), which is far away, it could move towards me.\n\nBut for now, it's distant, so I can focus on getting the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can aim for the apple at (5,3), which is directly below me.\n\nWait, no, (5,3) is above me. Wait, in this coordinate system, higher Y values are upwards.\n\nWait, no. In the board description, higher Y values are upwards, but in standard coordinates, higher Y is usually up.\n\nWait, in the prompt, it says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, yes, higher Y is upwards.\n\nMy position is (1,3), and (5,3) is at (5,3), which is to the right.\n\nWait, but (5,3) is to the right and at the same Y level.\n\nWait, no, (5,3) is at X=5, Y=3, so since I'm at X=1, Y=3, to get to X=5, Y=3, I need to move right 4 times.\n\nBut in the board description, row 3 has: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, at X=1, Y=3: '2' (me)\n\nAt X=5, Y=3: 'A' (apple)\n\nSo, yes, directly to the right.\n\nSo, path to (5,3) is right, right, right, right.\n\nBut that's a distance of 4, while (2,1) is distance 3.\n\nSo, (2,1) is closer.\n\nBut, moving to (5,3) might be safer because it's in a straight line, and there are no obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (1,3), move right to (2,3)\n\n- Then right to (3,3)\n\n- Then right to (4,3)\n\n- Then right to (5,3)\n\nLooking at row 3: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, from X=1 to X=5, it's empty except for the apple at X=5.\n\nSo, clear path.\n\nBut, it's farther than (2,1).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for.\n\nMaybe I should consider which apple is less likely to be taken by the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (3,9), which is closer to (5,9) than to (2,1).\n\nSo, maybe the enemy snake will go for (5,9), and I can go for (2,1).\n\nBut, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (5,3), which is directly to the right, and there are more apples in that general area.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (5,2) as well, which is adjacent to (5,3).\n\nSo, maybe I can aim for (5,3), eat that, then go to (5,2), and possibly (5,9).\n\nBut that would require moving up or down after eating (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), to (5,2): down\n\nTo (5,9): up to (5,6), then right to (5,9). Wait, Y increases upwards, so from (5,3) to (5,9) would be up 6 steps.\n\nThat seems like a long path.\n\nWhereas, after eating (2,1), I could aim for another apple.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (3,6).\n\nFrom my position (1,3), that's |3-1| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nFarther than (2,1).\n\nBut, perhaps it's a better long-term position.\n\nAlternatively, apple at (5,2): |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nStill farther than (2,1).\n\nSo, seems like (2,1) is still the closest.\n\nMoreover, moving to (2,1) puts me in a position where I can potentially reach other apples.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), I could move to (2,2), then (2,3), and so on.\n\nWait, no. After eating (2,1), my snake would be at (2,1), and my tail would be at (1,3), assuming I came from there.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your"

There are apples at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), and (3,6). There's an enemy snake #1 at (4,9) with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board based on the given positions:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . A . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere '.' is empty, '1' is enemy snake #1, '2' is my snake, and 'A' is an apple.\n\nWait, actually, the board state is provided, but it seems like my position is at (1,4), which according to the board description should be in row 4, column 1. But in the board snapshot, row 4 seems to have '. . . . . . . . . .', which doesn't match my position. There might be a mismatch here.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- The board coordinates are (X,Y), with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right.\n\n- My position is (1,4), which is X=1, Y=4.\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (4,9), which is X=4, Y=9.\n\n- Apples are at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), and (3,6).\n\nGiven that, perhaps the board snapshot provided is not accurately reflecting my position. Maybe there's a typo in the board description.\n\nRegardless, I'll proceed with the coordinates provided.\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to consider proximity, safety, and potential paths to other apples.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,4) to each apple:\n\n1. (2,1): |2-1| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. (5,3): |5-1| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (5,9): |5-1| + |9-4| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n4. (5,2): |5-1| + |2-4| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n5. (3,6): |3-1| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are (2,1) and (3,6), both with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to consider the positions relative to my current location and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's look at the paths to each:\n\nPath to (2,1):\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\nTotal moves: 1 right + 3 down = 4 moves\n\nPath to (3,6):\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\nTotal moves: 2 right + 2 up = 4 moves\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (4,9). It's relatively far away, and depending on its movement, it might not pose an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I need to plan my path considering that the enemy might move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nLooking at the apples, (5,9) is closest to the enemy snake, so perhaps it will go for that one.\n\nMeanwhile, I can aim for (2,1) or (3,6), which are closer to my current position.\n\nLet me also consider the board boundaries. The board is 10x10, so I need to be careful not to hit the edges.\n\nAdditionally, after eating one apple, I need to plan for the next one to maximize my score.\n\nSuppose I go for (2,1):\n\n- Path: right, down, down, down\n\n- After eating (2,1), my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\n- From (2,1), I can then aim for another apple, perhaps (5,2) or (5,3), but those are somewhat distant.\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6):\n\n- Path: right, right, up, up\n\n- After eating (3,6), I can potentially aim for (5,3) or (5,2), which are in the same general direction.\n\nConsidering this, maybe going for (3,6) is better for long-term planning, as it positions me closer to other apples.\n\nBut it's a bit farther in terms of moves, and I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's potential movement towards (5,9).\n\nWait, actually, (3,6) is closer to the enemy snake than (2,1), since the enemy is at (4,9), which is closer to (3,6) than to (2,1).\n\nDistance from enemy (4,9) to:\n\n- (2,1): |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (3,6): |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (5,3): |5-4| + |3-9| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- (5,9): |5-4| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (5,2): |5-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, the enemy is closest to (5,9), followed by (5,2), (5,3), (3,6), and (2,1) being the farthest.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the enemy will go for (5,9), and I can safely go for (2,1) or (3,6).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (2,1) is safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nBut, after eating (2,1), I would need to plan my next move carefully to avoid the enemy, especially if it's moving towards (5,9).\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6) might put me in a better position to capture more apples in the center of the board.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apples at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), (3,6)\n\n- Enemy at (4,9)\n\n- Me at (1,4)\n\nI need to balance between capturing apples quickly and positioning myself for future apple captures.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to aim for the apple at (5,3), which is in the center and has adjacent apples.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (3,4)\n\n- Right to (4,4)\n\n- Right to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\nTotal moves: 4 rights + 1 down = 5 moves\n\nBut this is farther than going to (2,1) or (3,6), which are 4 moves each.\n\nHowever, once at (5,3), I can easily reach (5,2) or (5,9), depending on the situation.\n\nWait, but (5,9) is far up, which might not be practical immediately.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,3), I can go to (5,2), which is down one step, and then perhaps to (2,1), but that would require moving left, which might not be efficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (5,2), which is adjacent to (5,3).\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (3,4)\n\n- Right to (4,4)\n\n- Right to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\nTotal moves: 4 rights + 2 downs = 6 moves\n\nThat's more moves than going directly to (2,1) or (3,6).\n\nSo, time is of the essence, and I should probably go for the closest apples first.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to go for (2,1), which is closer"

There are apples at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), and (3,6). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,9) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . 1 . A . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . A . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere '.' is empty, '1' is enemy snake #1, '2' is my snake, and 'A' is an apple.\n\nSo, my position is (1,3), which is in row 3, column 1. There's an apple at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider the positions of the enemy snake and any potential dangers.\n\nLet's list out the apples and their positions:\n\n1. (2,1)\n\n2. (5,3)\n\n3. (5,9)\n\n4. (5,2)\n\n5. (3,6)\n\nHmm, I should think about which one is closest to my current position. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple, since we can only move up, down, left, right.\n\nMy position: (1,3)\n\n- To (2,1): |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (5,3): |5-1| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- To (5,9): |5-1| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (5,2): |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (3,6): |3-1| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,9), which is fairly far from my current position and the closest apple.\n\nMoreover, I should check if there are any obstacles or potential collisions on the path to the apple at (2,1).\n\nFrom (1,3), to get to (2,1), I need to move right to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then down to (2,1).\n\nLet's see the board:\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (2,2): empty\n\n- (2,1): apple\n\nLooks clear. No enemy snakes or other obstacles in the way.\n\nWait, but there's another apple at (5,3), which is directly below me at (5,3), but that's further away with a distance of 4.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) and (5,9) are even farther.\n\n(3,6) is also fairly far.\n\nSo, seems like going for (2,1) is the best option.\n\nBut, I should also think about what happens after I eat this apple. Will I be able to reach another apple easily afterward?\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nLet me think about the path after eating (2,1).\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my snake will be longer, so I need to make sure that the tail doesn't block my path.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, and assuming I'm only one segment long, after eating the apple, I become two segments.\n\nBut in Snake games, typically, the tail moves forward as you eat apples, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this simple case, I think I can manage.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movement. Although it's currently at (3,9), which is far away, it could move towards me.\n\nBut for now, it's distant, so I can focus on getting the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can aim for the apple at (5,3), which is directly below me.\n\nWait, no, (5,3) is above me. Wait, in this coordinate system, higher Y values are upwards.\n\nWait, no. In the board description, higher Y values are upwards, but in standard coordinates, higher Y is usually up.\n\nWait, in the prompt, it says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, yes, higher Y is upwards.\n\nMy position is (1,3), and (5,3) is at (5,3), which is to the right.\n\nWait, but (5,3) is to the right and at the same Y level.\n\nWait, no, (5,3) is at X=5, Y=3, so since I'm at X=1, Y=3, to get to X=5, Y=3, I need to move right 4 times.\n\nBut in the board description, row 3 has: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, at X=1, Y=3: '2' (me)\n\nAt X=5, Y=3: 'A' (apple)\n\nSo, yes, directly to the right.\n\nSo, path to (5,3) is right, right, right, right.\n\nBut that's a distance of 4, while (2,1) is distance 3.\n\nSo, (2,1) is closer.\n\nBut, moving to (5,3) might be safer because it's in a straight line, and there are no obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (1,3), move right to (2,3)\n\n- Then right to (3,3)\n\n- Then right to (4,3)\n\n- Then right to (5,3)\n\nLooking at row 3: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, from X=1 to X=5, it's empty except for the apple at X=5.\n\nSo, clear path.\n\nBut, it's farther than (2,1).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for.\n\nMaybe I should consider which apple is less likely to be taken by the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (3,9), which is closer to (5,9) than to (2,1).\n\nSo, maybe the enemy snake will go for (5,9), and I can go for (2,1).\n\nBut, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (5,3), which is directly to the right, and there are more apples in that general area.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (5,2) as well, which is adjacent to (5,3).\n\nSo, maybe I can aim for (5,3), eat that, then go to (5,2), and possibly (5,9).\n\nBut that would require moving up or down after eating (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), to (5,2): down\n\nTo (5,9): up to (5,6), then right to (5,9). Wait, Y increases upwards, so from (5,3) to (5,9) would be up 6 steps.\n\nThat seems like a long path.\n\nWhereas, after eating (2,1), I could aim for another apple.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (3,6).\n\nFrom my position (1,3), that's |3-1| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nFarther than (2,1).\n\nBut, perhaps it's a better long-term position.\n\nAlternatively, apple at (5,2): |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nStill farther than (2,1).\n\nSo, seems like (2,1) is still the closest.\n\nMoreover, moving to (2,1) puts me in a position where I can potentially reach other apples.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), I could move to (2,2), then (2,3), and so on.\n\nWait, no. After eating (2,1), my snake would be at (2,1), and my tail would be at (1,3), assuming I came from there.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your"

The board is 10x10, so I need to be careful not to hit the edges.\n\nAdditionally, after eating one apple, I need to plan for the next one to maximize my score.\n\nSuppose I go for (2,1):\n\n- Path: right, down, down, down\n\n- After eating (2,1), my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\n- From (2,1), I can then aim for another apple, perhaps (5,2) or (5,3), but those are somewhat distant.\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6):\n\n- Path: right, right, up, up\n\n- After eating (3,6), I can potentially aim for (5,3) or (5,2), which are in the same general direction.\n\nConsidering this, maybe going for (3,6) is better for long-term planning, as it positions me closer to other apples.\n\nBut it's a bit farther in terms of moves, and I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's potential movement towards (5,9).\n\nWait, actually, (3,6) is closer to the enemy snake than (2,1), since the enemy is at (4,9), which is closer to (3,6) than to (2,1).\n\nDistance from enemy (4,9) to:\n\n- (2,1): |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (3,6): |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (5,3): |5-4| + |3-9| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- (5,9): |5-4| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (5,2): |5-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, the enemy is closest to (5,9), followed by (5,2), (5,3), (3,6), and (2,1) being the farthest.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the enemy will go for (5,9), and I can safely go for (2,1) or (3,6).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (2,1) is safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nBut, after eating (2,1), I would need to plan my next move carefully to avoid the enemy, especially if it's moving towards (5,9).\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6) might put me in a better position to capture more apples in the center of the board.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apples at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), (3,6)\n\n- Enemy at (4,9)\n\n- Me at (1,4)\n\nI need to balance between capturing apples quickly and positioning myself for future apple captures.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to aim for the apple at (5,3), which is in the center and has adjacent apples.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (3,4)\n\n- Right to (4,4)\n\n- Right to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\nTotal moves: 4 rights + 1 down = 5 moves\n\nBut this is farther than going to (2,1) or (3,6), which are 4 moves each.\n\nHowever, once at (5,3), I can easily reach (5,2) or (5,9), depending on the situation.\n\nWait, but (5,9) is far up, which might not be practical immediately.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,3), I can go to (5,2), which is down one step, and then perhaps to (2,1), but that would require moving left, which might not be efficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (5,2), which is adjacent to (5,3).\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (3,4)\n\n- Right to (4,4)\n\n- Right to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\nTotal moves: 4 rights + 2 downs = 6 moves\n\nThat's more moves than going directly to (2,1) or (3,6).\n\nSo, time is of the essence, and I should probably go for the closest apples first.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to go for (2,1), which is closer"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (1,3). There are apples at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), and (3,6). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,9) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . 1 . A . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . A . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere '.' is empty, '1' is enemy snake #1, '2' is my snake, and 'A' is an apple.\n\nSo, my position is (1,3), which is in row 3, column 1. There's an apple at (2,1), which is in row 1, column 2.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I have to consider the positions of the enemy snake and any potential dangers.\n\nLet's list out the apples and their positions:\n\n1. (2,1)\n\n2. (5,3)\n\n3. (5,9)\n\n4. (5,2)\n\n5. (3,6)\n\nHmm, I should think about which one is closest to my current position. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple, since we can only move up, down, left, right.\n\nMy position: (1,3)\n\n- To (2,1): |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- To (5,3): |5-1| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- To (5,9): |5-1| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (5,2): |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (3,6): |3-1| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (2,1) with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,9), which is fairly far from my current position and the closest apple.\n\nMoreover, I should check if there are any obstacles or potential collisions on the path to the apple at (2,1).\n\nFrom (1,3), to get to (2,1), I need to move right to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then down to (2,1).\n\nLet's see the board:\n\n- (2,3): empty\n\n- (2,2): empty\n\n- (2,1): apple\n\nLooks clear. No enemy snakes or other obstacles in the way.\n\nWait, but there's another apple at (5,3), which is directly below me at (5,3), but that's further away with a distance of 4.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) and (5,9) are even farther.\n\n(3,6) is also fairly far.\n\nSo, seems like going for (2,1) is the best option.\n\nBut, I should also think about what happens after I eat this apple. Will I be able to reach another apple easily afterward?\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nLet me think about the path after eating (2,1).\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my snake will be longer, so I need to make sure that the tail doesn't block my path.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm just starting, and assuming I'm only one segment long, after eating the apple, I become two segments.\n\nBut in Snake games, typically, the tail moves forward as you eat apples, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut in this simple case, I think I can manage.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movement. Although it's currently at (3,9), which is far away, it could move towards me.\n\nBut for now, it's distant, so I can focus on getting the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can aim for the apple at (5,3), which is directly below me.\n\nWait, no, (5,3) is above me. Wait, in this coordinate system, higher Y values are upwards.\n\nWait, no. In the board description, higher Y values are upwards, but in standard coordinates, higher Y is usually up.\n\nWait, in the prompt, it says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, yes, higher Y is upwards.\n\nMy position is (1,3), and (5,3) is at (5,3), which is to the right.\n\nWait, but (5,3) is to the right and at the same Y level.\n\nWait, no, (5,3) is at X=5, Y=3, so since I'm at X=1, Y=3, to get to X=5, Y=3, I need to move right 4 times.\n\nBut in the board description, row 3 has: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, at X=1, Y=3: '2' (me)\n\nAt X=5, Y=3: 'A' (apple)\n\nSo, yes, directly to the right.\n\nSo, path to (5,3) is right, right, right, right.\n\nBut that's a distance of 4, while (2,1) is distance 3.\n\nSo, (2,1) is closer.\n\nBut, moving to (5,3) might be safer because it's in a straight line, and there are no obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (1,3), move right to (2,3)\n\n- Then right to (3,3)\n\n- Then right to (4,3)\n\n- Then right to (5,3)\n\nLooking at row 3: . 2 . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, from X=1 to X=5, it's empty except for the apple at X=5.\n\nSo, clear path.\n\nBut, it's farther than (2,1).\n\nI need to decide which one to go for.\n\nMaybe I should consider which apple is less likely to be taken by the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (3,9), which is closer to (5,9) than to (2,1).\n\nSo, maybe the enemy snake will go for (5,9), and I can go for (2,1).\n\nBut, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (5,3), which is directly to the right, and there are more apples in that general area.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (5,2) as well, which is adjacent to (5,3).\n\nSo, maybe I can aim for (5,3), eat that, then go to (5,2), and possibly (5,9).\n\nBut that would require moving up or down after eating (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), to (5,2): down\n\nTo (5,9): up to (5,6), then right to (5,9). Wait, Y increases upwards, so from (5,3) to (5,9) would be up 6 steps.\n\nThat seems like a long path.\n\nWhereas, after eating (2,1), I could aim for another apple.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the apple at (3,6).\n\nFrom my position (1,3), that's |3-1| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nFarther than (2,1).\n\nBut, perhaps it's a better long-term position.\n\nAlternatively, apple at (5,2): |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nStill farther than (2,1).\n\nSo, seems like (2,1) is still the closest.\n\nMoreover, moving to (2,1) puts me in a position where I can potentially reach other apples.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), I could move to (2,2), then (2,3), and so on.\n\nWait, no. After eating (2,1), my snake would be at (2,1), and my tail would be at (1,3), assuming I came from there.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (1,4). There are apples at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), and (3,6). There's an enemy snake #1 at (4,9) with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. Coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board based on the given positions:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 3: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 2: . . . . . A . . . .\n\n- Row 1: . . A . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere '.' is empty, '1' is enemy snake #1, '2' is my snake, and 'A' is an apple.\n\nWait, actually, the board state is provided, but it seems like my position is at (1,4), which according to the board description should be in row 4, column 1. But in the board snapshot, row 4 seems to have '. . . . . . . . . .', which doesn't match my position. There might be a mismatch here.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- The board coordinates are (X,Y), with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right.\n\n- My position is (1,4), which is X=1, Y=4.\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (4,9), which is X=4, Y=9.\n\n- Apples are at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), and (3,6).\n\nGiven that, perhaps the board snapshot provided is not accurately reflecting my position. Maybe there's a typo in the board description.\n\nRegardless, I'll proceed with the coordinates provided.\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to consider proximity, safety, and potential paths to other apples.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,4) to each apple:\n\n1. (2,1): |2-1| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. (5,3): |5-1| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. (5,9): |5-1| + |9-4| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n4. (5,2): |5-1| + |2-4| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n5. (3,6): |3-1| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are (2,1) and (3,6), both with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to consider the positions relative to my current location and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's look at the paths to each:\n\nPath to (2,1):\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Down to (2,3)\n\n- Down to (2,2)\n\n- Down to (2,1)\n\nTotal moves: 1 right + 3 down = 4 moves\n\nPath to (3,6):\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (3,4)\n\n- Up to (3,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6)\n\nTotal moves: 2 right + 2 up = 4 moves\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (4,9). It's relatively far away, and depending on its movement, it might not pose an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, I need to plan my path considering that the enemy might move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nLooking at the apples, (5,9) is closest to the enemy snake, so perhaps it will go for that one.\n\nMeanwhile, I can aim for (2,1) or (3,6), which are closer to my current position.\n\nLet me also consider the board boundaries. The board is 10x10, so I need to be careful not to hit the edges.\n\nAdditionally, after eating one apple, I need to plan for the next one to maximize my score.\n\nSuppose I go for (2,1):\n\n- Path: right, down, down, down\n\n- After eating (2,1), my snake will grow, so I need to ensure that I have a clear path without hitting my own tail.\n\n- From (2,1), I can then aim for another apple, perhaps (5,2) or (5,3), but those are somewhat distant.\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6):\n\n- Path: right, right, up, up\n\n- After eating (3,6), I can potentially aim for (5,3) or (5,2), which are in the same general direction.\n\nConsidering this, maybe going for (3,6) is better for long-term planning, as it positions me closer to other apples.\n\nBut it's a bit farther in terms of moves, and I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's potential movement towards (5,9).\n\nWait, actually, (3,6) is closer to the enemy snake than (2,1), since the enemy is at (4,9), which is closer to (3,6) than to (2,1).\n\nDistance from enemy (4,9) to:\n\n- (2,1): |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n- (3,6): |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (5,3): |5-4| + |3-9| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- (5,9): |5-4| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (5,2): |5-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, the enemy is closest to (5,9), followed by (5,2), (5,3), (3,6), and (2,1) being the farthest.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the enemy will go for (5,9), and I can safely go for (2,1) or (3,6).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (2,1) is safer since it's farther from the enemy.\n\nBut, after eating (2,1), I would need to plan my next move carefully to avoid the enemy, especially if it's moving towards (5,9).\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6) might put me in a better position to capture more apples in the center of the board.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- Apples at (2,1), (5,3), (5,9), (5,2), (3,6)\n\n- Enemy at (4,9)\n\n- Me at (1,4)\n\nI need to balance between capturing apples quickly and positioning myself for future apple captures.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to aim for the apple at (5,3), which is in the center and has adjacent apples.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (3,4)\n\n- Right to (4,4)\n\n- Right to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\nTotal moves: 4 rights + 1 down = 5 moves\n\nBut this is farther than going to (2,1) or (3,6), which are 4 moves each.\n\nHowever, once at (5,3), I can easily reach (5,2) or (5,9), depending on the situation.\n\nWait, but (5,9) is far up, which might not be practical immediately.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,3), I can go to (5,2), which is down one step, and then perhaps to (2,1), but that would require moving left, which might not be efficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (5,2), which is adjacent to (5,3).\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Right to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (3,4)\n\n- Right to (4,4)\n\n- Right to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\nTotal moves: 4 rights + 2 downs = 6 moves\n\nThat's more moves than going directly to (2,1) or (3,6).\n\nSo, time is of the essence, and I should probably go for the closest apples first.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to go for (2,1), which is closer"

Move down to (2,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow by one\n\nThen, assess the situation and decide the next apple to go for.\n\nThis path doesn't seem to intersect with the enemy's path, assuming the enemy is moving down towards lower Y coordinates.\n\nAdditionally, after eating (2,1), I can consider moving towards (5,2) or (3,6), depending on the enemy's position.\n\nWait, but after eating (2,1), I'll be longer, so I need to make sure I don't hit my own tail.\n\nAssuming I move down to (2,2), then down to (2,1), my tail will be at (2,3), then (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,1), my head is at (2,1), and my tail is at (2,2).\n\nSo, I need to make sure my next moves don't lead me back into (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move right to (3,1), then (4,1), then (5,1), then up to (5,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,1), I can move up to (2,2), but that would be risky because (2,2) is now part of my body.\n\nWait, no, after eating the apple, my tail remains at (2,2), so moving back up to (2,2) would be hitting myself.\n\nTherefore, I should avoid moving back up immediately after eating the apple.\n\nSo, from (2,1), moving right to (3,1) seems safer.\n\nThen, continue right to (4,1), then (5,1), then up to (5,2) to eat the next apple.\n\nThis path seems safe, assuming the enemy doesn't move into my path.\n\nGiven that, I should proceed with moving down to (2,2) first.\n\nBut before that, I need to confirm that there are no obstacles in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (2,2) is empty, and (2,1) is an apple.\n\nSo, moving down to (2,2) is safe.\n\nThen, next move would be down to (2,1) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can move right to (3,1), then (4,1), then (5,1), then up to (5,2).\n\nI need to make sure that in the meantime, the enemy isn't moving into my path.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,9), moving down.\n\nSo, it's likely to move to (6,8), then (6,7), and so on.\n\nTherefore, it shouldn't interfere with my path to (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and (5,2).\n\nHence, moving down to (2,2) seems to be a safe and strategic move.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at my last move information, it seems I was previously at (1,3) and moved right to (2,3).\n\nBut in the current position, it's (2,3).\n\nWait, in the board visualization, '2' is at (1"
