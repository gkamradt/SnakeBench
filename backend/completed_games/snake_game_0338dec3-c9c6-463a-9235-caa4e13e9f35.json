The remaining apples are at (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 0), (6, 1), and (1, 5). \n\nSince we are trying to reach the apple at (6, 1), we should continue to move right and then down. However, we should be cautious of the enemy snake at (4, 9) and try to avoid it. \n\nOur current position is (4, 5), and the enemy snake is at (4, 9), which is above us. We can safely move right for now, but we should keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and be prepared to change our path if necessary.\n\nIt seems that moving right would put us in a better position to reach the apple at (6, 1) while also avoiding the enemy snake. \n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving right, we should continue to assess the board and plan a safe path to the apple at (6, 1), considering the positions of enemy snakes and potential risks. We should also be aware of the enemy snake's possible moves and try to stay out of its way.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"

To avoid this, I need to find a detour. The apple at (6, 1) seems to be a better option for now as it's closer than the one at (9, 0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: I will move up to avoid the enemy snake, then try to move towards the apple at (6, 1). If I can't reach it in one move, I will try to move towards the apple at (9, 2) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nNext move: UP"
