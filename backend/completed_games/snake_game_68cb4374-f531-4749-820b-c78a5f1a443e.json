If I continue upward, I will get closer to my target but I might face a tougher situation when Snake#2 moves towards the apple at (4, 3). Unfortunately, there isn't any direct path to the apple at (1, 7) without potentially crossing paths with Snake#2. \nHowever, if I purposefully move RIGHT and then DOWN, it would force Snake#2 to either aim for another apple at a different position or block its path to shift up towards apple (4, 3) if it continues that direction, allowing me to have some space to move and access towards my target apple. It might be a risky strategy but worth a shot to gain the apple at (1, 7).\n\nHence, my next move is: RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current game state to determine the best possible move:\n\n**Current Position:** (2, 3)\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n- **UP** to (2, 4)\n- **DOWN** to (2, 2)\n- **LEFT** to (1, 3)\n- **RIGHT** to (3, 3)\n\n**Assessing Safety:**\n- **Walls:** All potential moves keep the snake within the 10x10 grid.\n- **Enemy Snakes:**\n  - Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 3) is safe as there are no enemy snakes occupying that position.\n  - Moving **UP** to (2, 4) is safe and does not result in an immediate collision.\n  - Moving **LEFT** to (1, 3) keeps the snake away from the enemy at (8,2) and its body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n  - Moving **DOWN** to (2, 2) is safe and brings the snake closer to an apple.\n- **Own Body:**\n  - Ensure that moving **UP** to (2, 4) does not lead back into the body if the tail hasn't moved. However, based on the current board state, it appears safe.\n  - Other directions do not threaten a collision with the snake's own body.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- **(2, 2):** Moving **DOWN** to (2, 2) will allow the snake to consume this apple immediately, resulting in growth and an increase in points.\n- **(1, 7):** While moving **LEFT** positions the snake towards this apple, it requires more moves compared to heading directly to (2, 2).\n- **Other Apples:** Apples at (1,7), (5,3), and (7,9) are farther and would require navigating around the board, which is less efficient.\n\n**Strategy Consideration:**\n- **Immediate Gain:** Consuming the closest apple at (2, 2) by moving **DOWN** ensures a quick point gain and reduces the snake's vulnerability.\n- **Future Moves:** After consuming the apple at (2, 2), the snake can reassess and plan the next move based on the updated board state, potentially heading towards the next closest apple.\n- **Safety Buffer:** Continuously moving towards the nearest apple minimizes the time spent in potentially crowded areas, reducing the risk of collisions with enemy snakes.\n\n**Next Move Decision:**\nBalancing safety with immediate point acquisition, moving **DOWN** to (2, 2) is the most advantageous move. This action allows the snake to consume the nearby apple, grow in length, and maintain a strategic position on the board.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving **DOWN** and consuming the apple at (2, 2), the snake should aim to navigate towards the next closest apple, such as at (2, 1) or reposition towards (1, 7) while keeping an eye on enemy movements to avoid potential collisions.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"
