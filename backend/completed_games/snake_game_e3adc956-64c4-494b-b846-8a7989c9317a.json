Moving towards it will also keep me away from the walls.\n\nThe apple at (8, 4) is also still a viable target, as it is still relatively close and moving towards it would not put me in danger of colliding with the enemy snake.\n\nTo collect these apples, I will need to continue moving up and to the right. Therefore, my next move is: RIGHT.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to keep moving towards the apples at (3, 5) and (8, 4), while constantly monitoring the enemy snake's position and adjusting my movements accordingly to avoid any collisions.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
