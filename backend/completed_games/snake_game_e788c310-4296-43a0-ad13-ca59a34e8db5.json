The enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (7, 8) without a body trailing, so it isn't an immediate threat.\n\n2. **Apple Locations:**\n   - (8, 6) is directly reachable if I continue moving UP and then RIGHT.\n   - (5, 9) is quite distant and would require several moves upwards and left.\n   - (5, 1), (1, 5), and (3, 4) are also further compared to the apple at (8, 6).\n\n3. **Potential Moves:**\n\n   - **UP (7, 6):** This move will keep me on a direct path toward the apple at (8, 6). Maximum two turns get me an apple. Moving UP takes me further from Snake #2.\n\n   - **DOWN (7, 4):** This would take me back to the position I just left.

Currently, Snake #2 is not threatening this path, but this move doesn\u2019t support my immediate goal to eat an apple.\n\n   - **RIGHT (8, 5):** Moving RIGHT helps in getting closer to the apple at (8, 6) but still requires another move to reach it. \n\n4. **Assessment and Strategy:**\n   - The apple at (8, 6) is currently the closest and reachable goal.\n   - Continuing UP (7, 6) is safe and directly aligned with acquiring the nearest apple.\n   - Despite the proximity of the enemy snake further up, it poses no immediate threat given its current static position relative to my path.\n\n**Strategy for the Next Turn:**\n1. Prioritize reaching the apple at (8, 6).\n2. Continue to monitor positions of both the apple and the enemy snake to adjust strategy dynamically.\n3.

It doesn't bring me into immediate collision risks as the enemy snake is further away.\n\n2. **DOWN (7, 3):** This move takes me away from potential apples, so it is less strategic unless evading, which is not needed right now.\n\n3. **LEFT (6, 4):** Moves toward the boundary of Snake #2\u2019s initial position on the board, although it is not currently a threat as Snake #2 is well out of the way.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8, 4):** Moves closer to apple at (8, 6), but does not get me immediately closer in terms of Y-coordinate.\n\nGiven this information, the optimal choice is to move **UP** to (7, 5) as it gets me closer to the apple at (8, 6) without any immediate threat of running into another snake and also keeps options open for subsequent moves either towards other apples or away if necessary. Going UP also keeps me within the central area of the board, offering flexibility for future turns.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Assess proximity to apples and position relative to enemy snake, prioritize closing in on nearby apples while maintaining safe distance from boundaries and potential collision paths.\n\nMy decided next move is: **UP**."

Maximum two turns get me an apple. Moving UP takes me further from Snake #2.\n\n   - **DOWN (7, 4):** This would take me back to the position I just left. While it's not immediately dangerous, it doesn\u2019t help in reaching any apples quickly and reduces my flexibility.\n\n   - **LEFT (6, 5):** This move positions me closer to boundaries and away from several apples. Currently, Snake #2 is not threatening this path, but this move doesn\u2019t support my immediate goal to eat an apple.\n\n   - **RIGHT (8, 5):** Moving RIGHT helps in getting closer to the apple at (8, 6) but still requires another move to reach it. \n\n4. **Assessment and Strategy:**\n   - The apple at (8, 6) is currently the closest and reachable goal.\n   - Continuing UP (7, 6) is safe and directly aligned with acquiring the nearest apple.\n   - Despite the proximity of the enemy snake further up, it poses no immediate threat given its current static position relative to my path.\n\n**Strategy for the Next Turn:**\n1. Prioritize reaching the apple at (8, 6).\n2. Continue to monitor positions of both the apple and the enemy snake to adjust strategy dynamically.\n3.

Based on recent decisions, I moved RIGHT to collect the apple at position (8, 6). This move increases my point total and allows the evaluation of further strategies.\n\n2. **Updated Apple Locations:** After acquiring the apple at (8, 6), my primary goal becomes strategizing the next most efficient apple acquisition.\n\n   - Remaining apples are located at: (5, 9), (5, 1), (1, 5), (3, 4), (5, 8).\n\n3. **Potential Moves:**\n\n   - **UP (8, 7):** This move doesn't immediately lead to an apple but positions me possibly towards (5, 8), the nearest apple vertically.\n\n   - **DOWN (8, 5):** This direction doesn't effectively contribute to reaching another apple soon due to the board layout.\n\n   - **LEFT (7, 6):** Moving LEFT doesn\u2019t align with an immediate goal since I just came from that direction, and doesn't lead to an apple efficiently.\n\n   - **RIGHT (9, 6):** While this move doesn't lead directly towards an apple, it offers space before eventually planning vertical movement. It doesn't improve my position towards immediate apple acquisition, though.\n\n4. **Assessment and Strategy:**\n\n   - With Snake #2 situated at (9, 8), there is minimal threat of collision at this time as it remains confined to the top-right area.\n\n   - To maximize efficiency towards the next apple, targeting (5, 8) could be optimal since there is a clear path and it\u2019s relatively close.\n\n   - Safety is crucial. I need to ensure I don't inadvertently move into a position that can corner me or leave me with limited options.\n\n5. **Decision and Action Plan:**\n\n   - Moving UP towards (8, 7) seems strategically sound for heading towards the apple at (5, 8). After moving UP, I can then navigate further left to make progress towards this apple.\n\n   - I should continually reassess Snake #2's position to ensure no head-to-head collisions occur.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n1. Move UP towards (8, 7), opening potential pathways to fruit.\n2. Reassess any changes in the enemy's movements and apple locations, especially after my UP move, to ensure efficient and safe continued progress.\n\nMy decided next move is: **UP**."
