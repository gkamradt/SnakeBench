In that case, moving right might still be a good choice because I can quickly move left if necessary.\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. There are two apples in the vicinity: one at (1, 0) and one at (5, 5). The apple at (5, 5) is closer to me, so it would be beneficial to move towards it.\n\nHowever, there's an apple at (4, 7) that's further away but still within reach.

If Snake #2 moves towards me, I'll adjust my direction accordingly.\n\nNext move: RIGHT, but with the understanding that I'll adjust my direction if necessary to avoid Snake #2.\n\n--End of your analysis and strategy.--"

Since I am already at x=0, moving left would result in a collision with the wall. Therefore, I should move down to (1, 9) and then move left to reach the apple.\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving down, I will move left to reach the apple at (0, 5).
