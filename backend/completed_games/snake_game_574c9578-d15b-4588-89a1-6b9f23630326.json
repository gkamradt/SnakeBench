The previous move was **LEFT**, so the tail segments are likely trailing towards the right.\n- **Enemy Snake (#2):** Head at **(9, 0)** with a body segment at **(9, 1)**.\n- **Apples:** Positioned at **(0, 4)**, **(6, 4)**, **(3, 0)**, **(7, 3)**, **(5, 1)**, and just collected at **(6, 8)**.\n\n**Possible Directions from (6, 8):**\n1. **UP to (6, 9):**\n   - **Pros:** Moves towards the top edge, potentially opening up new areas for movement.\n   - **Cons:** No immediate apple in this direction; gets closer to the wall, which could limit future movement options.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7):**\n   - **Pros:** Directly moves closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, aligning with the goal of maximizing points.\n   - **Cons:** Needs to ensure that the path remains clear in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8):**\n   - **Pros:** Opens up pathways to the left side of the board.\n   - **Cons:** Further distance from the nearest apple; requires additional moves to reach an apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n   - **Pros:** Potentially retraces the previous path, which might still be safe if the tail has moved.\n   - **Cons:** Risk of colliding with the tail segment at **(7, 8)** or getting trapped in a loop.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Proximity to Apples:** Moving **DOWN** targets the nearest apple at **(6, 4)**, allowing for a more straightforward path to increase points quickly.\n- **Safety:** \n  - **UP:** While safe, it doesn't offer immediate advantages and could limit future movements.\n  - **DOWN:** Currently safe with no immediate threats from enemy snakes.\n  - **LEFT:** Safe but less efficient in reaching a nearby apple.\n  - **RIGHT:** Potentially risky due to proximity to the tail.\n\n- **Future Opportunities:** Moving **DOWN** keeps options open for subsequent moves towards other apples while maintaining a clear path without immediate threats.\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- **Self-Trapping:** After moving **DOWN**, ensure that the snake doesn't corner itself, especially as it grows longer.\n- **Wall Collision:** Maintain awareness of the board boundaries to prevent accidental collisions when maneuvering.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **DOWN**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving **DOWN** to **(6, 7)** and potentially collecting the apple at **(6, 4)**, continue navigating towards other apples while avoiding walls and enemy snakes. Prioritize movements that keep multiple pathways open to maximize flexibility and prevent getting trapped as the snake grows.\n\n**Next Move:** DOWN"

The closest apple to my current position is at (0, 4), but it is on the other side of the board, and the enemy snake is in the way. The next closest apple is at (3, 0), so my next move should be to go DOWN to collect it.\n\nNext turn, I will try to move RIGHT to collect the apple at (6, 4) if the enemy snake is not in the way.\n\nMy next move: DOWN."
