There are apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1). Oh, wait, (4,1) is an apple, but there's also an enemy snake at (4,2), which is snake #1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me. There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer. Then, maybe move left towards (4,1).\n\n- But, if I move down to (6,0), and then left, I need to ensure my body doesn't block my path.\n\n- Also, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2). I need to be careful not to get too close to it.\n\nWait, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, snakes can grow, so I don't know if the enemy is moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats there.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,0):\n\n- Current position: (6,1)\n\n- Move down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1) or up towards other apples.\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my body will be longer, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nWait, since my body is growing, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach. Perhaps try to go for the apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nBut that's farther away, and there might be more risks involved.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Down is (6,0), which is an apple.\n\nLeft is (5,1), then (4,1), which is an apple, but near enemy at (4,2).\n\nUp is (6,2), then (6,3), and so on.\n\nRight is (7,1), then (7,2), etc.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), eat the apple, grow longer, then move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left to (5,1), then (4,1), but I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves. So, I need to make sure that the path I take after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, then consider moving right or up.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, there are more apples spread out. I need a strategy to collect as many as possible without dying.\n\nMaybe I should think about which apples are closest and least risky to get.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is directly below me, no obstacles. I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1).\n\nEnemy at (4,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, maybe move up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nOption 2: Go for (4,1) first.\n\n- Move left to (5,1), then (4,1), eat apple.\n\n- But, enemy is at (4,2), so there might be a risk.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,9) first.\n\n- Move right to (7,1), then up to (7,2), and so on, up to (7,9).\n\n-"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right.\n\nApples are located at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (8,3). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (4,1), with its body at (4,2).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: . . . . T . 2 . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, I can see that:\n\n- There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me.\n\n- Another apple at (4,1), which is to the left and a bit down.\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (4,1), with its body at (4,2).\n\n- Other apples are at (3,5), (5,7), and (7,9), (8,3).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) or try to reach another one.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,1):\n\n- That's directly below me. There's nothing there, so it's safe.\n\n- Then, moving down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- After eating the apple, my snake will grow longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful because growing longer means my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't run into it while maneuvering.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left or right to position myself for other apples.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\n- Moving left from (6,2) to (5,2), then to (4,2), but (4,2) is where the enemy's body is. That might not be safe.\n\n- Moving right from (6,2) to (7,2), then to (7,3), and so on, towards (7,9). That's a possibility, but it's a longer path.\n\n- Moving up from (6,2) to (6,3), then towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Going down to (6,1), then (6,0) seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's position and movement. If the enemy is at (4,1), and its body is at (4,2), it might be moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nI need to avoid getting too close to the enemy, especially since if I go left towards (4,1), I might collide with the enemy or its body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider my next move.\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\n1. Move down from (6,2) to (6,1).\n\n2. Then down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows longer, so my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,0), I can consider moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (5,0), then to (4,0), but there are no apples there, and I might be moving away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,0), then up towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (6,0) to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and I can't move there immediately after eating the apple because my tail moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves first, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my snake is longer, and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I move up from (6,0) to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since I've grown, my tail remains at (6,1), and the rest of the body shifts.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me recall: in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your head moves forward.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my head is at (6,0), and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since the tail has moved forward, it's now at (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would mean my head is where my tail just was, but I need to make sure that my body doesn't block the path.\n\nThis might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,0): 2 steps down from (6,2).\n\n- (4,1): 2 steps left and 1 step down from (6,2).\n\n- (3,5): 3 steps left and 3 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (5,7): 1 step left and 5 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (7,9): 1 step right and 7 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (8,3): 2 steps right and 1 step down from (6,2).\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (4,1), and its body is at (4,2), I might want to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,0) first is the safest option.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving right towards (8,3), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (6,0), moving right to (7,0), then (8,0), then up to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nBut those are farther away, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (8,3) after (6,0) is a better idea.\n\nLet me plan that:\n\n1. Move down to (6,1).\n\n2. Move down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n3. Move right to (7,0).\n\n4. Move right to (8,0).\n\n5. Move up to (8,1).\n\n6. Move up to (8,2).\n\n7. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can avoid the area with the enemy.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movements, as it might change its position by the time I reach (8,3).\n\nBut for now, focusing on eating (6,0) and then (8,3) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (8,3) directly from (6,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,2), moving right to (7,2), then (8,2), then down to (8,1), then (8,0), then up to (8,1) again, which is redundant.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, from (6,2), moving right to (7,2), then (8,2), then down to (8,1), then (8,0), but that's going down, which might not be the most efficient path.\n\nPerhaps it's better to first move down to (6,1), then right to (7,1), then (8,1), then up to (8,2), then (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems more direct.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Move down to (6,1).\n\n2. Move right to (7,1).\n\n3. Move right to (8,1).\n\n4. Move up to (8,2).\n\n5. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I can consider my next move.\n\nAt that point, I would have eaten two apples, and my snake would be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nBut for now, focusing on"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (6,1). There are apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1). Oh, wait, (4,1) is an apple, but there's also an enemy snake at (4,2), which is snake #1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me. There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer. Then, maybe move left towards (4,1).\n\n- But, if I move down to (6,0), and then left, I need to ensure my body doesn't block my path.\n\n- Also, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2). I need to be careful not to get too close to it.\n\nWait, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, snakes can grow, so I don't know if the enemy is moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats there.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,0):\n\n- Current position: (6,1)\n\n- Move down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1) or up towards other apples.\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my body will be longer, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nWait, since my body is growing, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach. Perhaps try to go for the apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nBut that's farther away, and there might be more risks involved.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Down is (6,0), which is an apple.\n\nLeft is (5,1), then (4,1), which is an apple, but near enemy at (4,2).\n\nUp is (6,2), then (6,3), and so on.\n\nRight is (7,1), then (7,2), etc.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), eat the apple, grow longer, then move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left to (5,1), then (4,1), but I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves. So, I need to make sure that the path I take after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, then consider moving right or up.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, there are more apples spread out. I need a strategy to collect as many as possible without dying.\n\nMaybe I should think about which apples are closest and least risky to get.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is directly below me, no obstacles. I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1).\n\nEnemy at (4,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, maybe move up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nOption 2: Go for (4,1) first.\n\n- Move left to (5,1), then (4,1), eat apple.\n\n- But, enemy is at (4,2), so there might be a risk.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,9) first.\n\n- Move right to (7,1), then up to (7,2), and so on, up to (7,9).\n\n-"

There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,1), with its body at (4,1).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . .

There's nothing there, so it's safe.\n\n- Then, moving down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- After eating the apple, my snake will grow longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful because growing longer means my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't run into it while maneuvering.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left or right to position myself for other apples.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\n- Moving left from (6,3) to (5,3), then to (4,3), but (4,1) has the enemy's body. That might not be safe.\n\n- Moving right from (6,3) to (7,3), then to (7,4), and so on, towards (7,9).

The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Going down to (6,1), then (6,0) seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's position and movement.

There are apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1). Oh, wait, (4,1) is an apple, but there's also an enemy snake at (4,2), which is snake #1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . .

There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer. Then, maybe move left towards (4,1).\n\n- But, if I move down to (6,0), and then left, I need to ensure my body doesn't block my path.\n\n- Also, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2). I need to be careful not to get too close to it.\n\nWait, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, snakes can grow, so I don't know if the enemy is moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats there.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,0):\n\n- Current position: (6,1)\n\n- Move down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1) or up towards other apples.\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my body will be longer, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nWait, since my body is growing, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach. Perhaps try to go for the apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nBut that's farther away, and there might be more risks involved.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Down is (6,0), which is an apple.\n\nLeft is (5,1), then (4,1), which is an apple, but near enemy at (4,2).\n\nUp is (6,2), then (6,3), and so on.\n\nRight is (7,1), then (7,2), etc.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), eat the apple, grow longer, then move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left to (5,1), then (4,1), but I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves. So, I need to make sure that the path I take after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, then consider moving right or up.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, there are more apples spread out. I need a strategy to collect as many as possible without dying.\n\nMaybe I should think about which apples are closest and least risky to get.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is directly below me, no obstacles. I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1).\n\nEnemy at (4,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, maybe move up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nOption 2: Go for (4,1) first.\n\n- Move left to (5,1), then (4,1), eat apple.\n\n- But, enemy is at (4,2), so there might be a risk.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,9) first.\n\n- Move right to (7,1), then up to (7,2), and so on, up to (7,9).\n\n-"

A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . .

A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, I can see that:\n\n- There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me.\n\n- Another apple at (4,1), which is to the left and a bit down.\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (4,1), with its body at (4,2).\n\n- Other apples are at (3,5), (5,7), and (7,9), (8,3).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) or try to reach another one.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,1):\n\n- That's directly below me. There's nothing there, so it's safe.\n\n- Then, moving down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- After eating the apple, my snake will grow longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful because growing longer means my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't run into it while maneuvering.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left or right to position myself for other apples.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\n- Moving left from (6,2) to (5,2), then to (4,2), but (4,2) is where the enemy's body is. That might not be safe.\n\n- Moving right from (6,2) to (7,2), then to (7,3), and so on, towards (7,9). That's a possibility, but it's a longer path.\n\n- Moving up from (6,2) to (6,3), then towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Going down to (6,1), then (6,0) seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's position and movement. If the enemy is at (4,1), and its body is at (4,2), it might be moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nI need to avoid getting too close to the enemy, especially since if I go left towards (4,1), I might collide with the enemy or its body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider my next move.\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\n1. Move down from (6,2) to (6,1).\n\n2. Then down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows longer, so my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,0), I can consider moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (5,0), then to (4,0), but there are no apples there, and I might be moving away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,0), then up towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (6,0) to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and I can't move there immediately after eating the apple because my tail moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves first, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my snake is longer, and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I move up from (6,0) to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since I've grown, my tail remains at (6,1), and the rest of the body shifts.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me recall: in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your head moves forward.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my head is at (6,0), and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since the tail has moved forward, it's now at (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would mean my head is where my tail just was, but I need to make sure that my body doesn't block the path.\n\nThis might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,0): 2 steps down from (6,2).\n\n- (4,1): 2 steps left and 1 step down from (6,2).\n\n- (3,5): 3 steps left and 3 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (5,7): 1 step left and 5 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (7,9): 1 step right and 7 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (8,3): 2 steps right and 1 step down from (6,2).\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (4,1), and its body is at (4,2), I might want to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,0) first is the safest option.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving right towards (8,3), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (6,0), moving right to (7,0), then (8,0), then up to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nBut those are farther away, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (8,3) after (6,0) is a better idea.\n\nLet me plan that:\n\n1. Move down to (6,1).\n\n2. Move down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n3. Move right to (7,0).\n\n4. Move right to (8,0).\n\n5. Move up to (8,1).\n\n6. Move up to (8,2).\n\n7. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can avoid the area with the enemy.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movements, as it might change its position by the time I reach (8,3).\n\nBut for now, focusing on eating (6,0) and then (8,3) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (8,3) directly from (6,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,2), moving right to (7,2), then (8,2), then down to (8,1), then (8,0), then up to (8,1) again, which is redundant.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, from (6,2), moving right to (7,2), then (8,2), then down to (8,1), then (8,0), but that's going down, which might not be the most efficient path.\n\nPerhaps it's better to first move down to (6,1), then right to (7,1), then (8,1), then up to (8,2), then (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems more direct.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Move down to (6,1).\n\n2. Move right to (7,1).\n\n3. Move right to (8,1).\n\n4. Move up to (8,2).\n\n5. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I can consider my next move.\n\nAt that point, I would have eaten two apples, and my snake would be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nBut for now, focusing on"

There are apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1). Oh, wait, (4,1) is an apple, but there's also an enemy snake at (4,2), which is snake #1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me. There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer. Then, maybe move left towards (4,1).\n\n- But, if I move down to (6,0), and then left, I need to ensure my body doesn't block my path.\n\n- Also, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2). I need to be careful not to get too close to it.\n\nWait, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, snakes can grow, so I don't know if the enemy is moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats there.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,0):\n\n- Current position: (6,1)\n\n- Move down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1) or up towards other apples.\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my body will be longer, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nWait, since my body is growing, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach. Perhaps try to go for the apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nBut that's farther away, and there might be more risks involved.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Down is (6,0), which is an apple.\n\nLeft is (5,1), then (4,1), which is an apple, but near enemy at (4,2).\n\nUp is (6,2), then (6,3), and so on.\n\nRight is (7,1), then (7,2), etc.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), eat the apple, grow longer, then move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left to (5,1), then (4,1), but I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves. So, I need to make sure that the path I take after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, then consider moving right or up.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, there are more apples spread out. I need a strategy to collect as many as possible without dying.\n\nMaybe I should think about which apples are closest and least risky to get.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is directly below me, no obstacles. I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1).\n\nEnemy at (4,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, maybe move up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nOption 2: Go for (4,1) first.\n\n- Move left to (5,1), then (4,1), eat apple.\n\n- But, enemy is at (4,2), so there might be a risk.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,9) first.\n\n- Move right to (7,1), then up to (7,2), and so on, up to (7,9).\n\n-"

There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,2), with its body at (3,1).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . .

The apple at (6,0) is directly below me, which seems straightforward. I can move down step by step to reach it without any immediate obstacles.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,3), and its body is at (3,2).

Eating one apple doesn't remove the others.\n\nWait, no, in Snake games, eating one apple removes that specific apple.\n\nSo, if I eat (8,3), (8,3) is removed, and the apple at (6,0) remains.\n\nSo, after eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,3) to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,3), I can move right to (9,3), then up to (9,4), (9,5), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far in that direction.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for (6,0) first, as initially thought.\n\nLet me compare the two options:\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Path: Down to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n\n- After eating (6,0), move right to (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the second apple.\n\nOption 2: Go for (8,3) first.\n\n- Path: Right to (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3).\n\n- After eating (8,3), move down to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the next apple.\n\nComparing the two, Option 2 seems shorter in terms of moves to reach the first apple.\n\nAlso, it allows me to cover more ground towards the center of the board, where there are other apples.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 2 is better.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy's movement.\n\nIf the enemy is moving towards (3,5), which is in the opposite direction, it should not interfere with my path to (8,3).\n\nTherefore, I think I'll go with Option 2: head for (8,3) first.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right, to (7,5).\n\nThen, continue right to (8,5), down to (8,4), and (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can decide based on the board state and the enemy's position.\n\nBut for now, I'll commit to moving right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer. Then, maybe move left towards (4,1).\n\n- But, if I move down to (6,0), and then left, I need to ensure my body doesn't block my path.\n\n- Also, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2). I need to be careful not to get too close to it.\n\nWait, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, snakes can grow, so I don't know if the enemy is moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats there.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,0):\n\n- Current position: (6,1)\n\n- Move down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1) or up towards other apples.\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my body will be longer, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nWait, since my body is growing, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach. Perhaps try to go for the apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nBut that's farther away, and there might be more risks involved.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Down is (6,0), which is an apple.\n\nLeft is (5,1), then (4,1), which is an apple, but near enemy at (4,2).\n\nUp is (6,2), then (6,3), and so on.\n\nRight is (7,1), then (7,2), etc.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), eat the apple, grow longer, then move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left to (5,1), then (4,1), but I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves. So, I need to make sure that the path I take after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, then consider moving right or up.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, there are more apples spread out. I need a strategy to collect as many as possible without dying.\n\nMaybe I should think about which apples are closest and least risky to get.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is directly below me, no obstacles. I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1).\n\nEnemy at (4,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, maybe move up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nOption 2: Go for (4,1) first.\n\n- Move left to (5,1), then (4,1), eat apple.\n\n- But, enemy is at (4,2), so there might be a risk.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,9) first.\n\n- Move right to (7,1), then up to (7,2), and so on, up to (7,9).\n\n-"

A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . 2 . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . 1 T . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, I can see that:\n\n- There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me.\n\n- Another apple at (3,5), which is to the left and up.\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (3,2), with its body at (3,1).\n\n- Other apples are at (5,7), (7,9), and (8,3).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) or try to reach another one.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,3):\n\n- That's directly below me. There's nothing there, so it's safe.\n\n- Then, moving down to (6,2), then (6,1), and finally (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- After eating the apple, my snake will grow longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful because growing longer means my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't run into it while maneuvering.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left or right to position myself for other apples.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\n- Moving left from (6,4) to (5,4), then to (4,4), but I need to see if there are any obstacles or apples in that direction.\n\n- Moving right from (6,4) to (7,4), then to (7,5), and so on, towards (7,9). That's a possibility, but it's a longer path.\n\n- Moving up from (6,4) to (6,5), then towards (5,7) or (3,5).\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Going down to (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), and (6,0) seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's position and movement. If the enemy is at (3,2), and its body is at (3,1), it might be moving towards the apple at (3,5).\n\nI need to avoid getting too close to the enemy, especially since if I go left towards (3,5), I might collide with the enemy or its body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider my next move.\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\n1. Move down from (6,4) to (6,3).\n\n2. Then down to (6,2).\n\n3. Then down to (6,1).\n\n4. Then down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows longer, so my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,0), I can consider moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (5,0), then to (4,0), but there are no apples there, and I might be moving away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,0), then up towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (6,0) to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and I can't move there immediately after eating the apple because my tail moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your head moves forward.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my head is at (6,0), and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since the tail has moved forward, it's now at (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would mean my head is where my tail just was, but I need to make sure that my body doesn't block the path.\n\nThis might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,0): 4 steps down from (6,4).\n\n- (3,5): 3 steps left and 1 step up from (6,4).\n\n- (5,7): 1 step left and 3 steps up from (6,4).\n\n- (7,9): 1 step right and 5 steps up from (6,4).\n\n- (8,3): 2 steps right and 1 step down from (6,4).\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (3,2), and its body is at (3,1), I might want to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,0) first is the safest option.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving right towards (8,3), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (6,0), moving right to (7,0), then (8,0), then up to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nBut those are farther away, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (8,3) after (6,0) is a better idea.\n\nLet me plan that:\n\n1. Move down to (6,3).\n\n2. Move down to (6,2).\n\n3. Move down to (6,1).\n\n4. Move down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n5. Move right to (7,0).\n\n6. Move right to (8,0).\n\n7. Move up to (8,1).\n\n8. Move up to (8,2).\n\n9. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can avoid the area with the enemy.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movements, as it might change its position by the time I reach (8,3).\n\nBut for now, focusing on eating (6,0) and then (8,3) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (8,3) directly from (6,4).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,4), moving right to (7,4), then (8,4), then down to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's only three steps.\n\nBut wait, is there anything in the way?\n\nLooking at the board, at (7,4) and (8,4), there doesn't seem to be anything.\n\nSo, that could work.\n\nAfter eating (8,3), I can consider moving up towards (7,9) or down towards (6,0).\n\nBut (6,0) is already eaten, so maybe moving up towards (7,9).\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nComparing this to the previous plan, going for (8,3) first seems faster, as it's only three moves away, whereas going down to (6,0) is four moves down.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritizing (8,3) first makes more sense in terms of efficiency.\n\nAfter eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0), but since I've already eaten it, maybe moving up towards (7,9).\n\nBut wait, (6,0) is already eaten in this scenario, so I don't need to go there again.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nLet me think about the possible paths after eating (8,3):\n\n- Moving up to (8,4), then (8,5), (8,6), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\n- Or moving left to (7,3), then up towards (7,9).\n\nEither way, I need to plan carefully to avoid running into the enemy or my own"

The apple at (6,0) is directly below me, which seems straightforward. I can move down step by step to reach it without any immediate obstacles.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,3), and its body is at (3,2).

Eating one apple doesn't remove the others.\n\nWait, no, in Snake games, eating one apple removes that specific apple.\n\nSo, if I eat (8,3), (8,3) is removed, and the apple at (6,0) remains.\n\nSo, after eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,3) to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,3), I can move right to (9,3), then up to (9,4), (9,5), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far in that direction.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for (6,0) first, as initially thought.\n\nLet me compare the two options:\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Path: Down to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n\n- After eating (6,0), move right to (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the second apple.\n\nOption 2: Go for (8,3) first.\n\n- Path: Right to (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3).\n\n- After eating (8,3), move down to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the next apple.\n\nComparing the two, Option 2 seems shorter in terms of moves to reach the first apple.\n\nAlso, it allows me to cover more ground towards the center of the board, where there are other apples.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 2 is better.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy's movement.\n\nIf the enemy is moving towards (3,5), which is in the opposite direction, it should not interfere with my path to (8,3).\n\nTherefore, I think I'll go with Option 2: head for (8,3) first.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right, to (7,5).\n\nThen, continue right to (8,5), down to (8,4), and (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can decide based on the board state and the enemy's position.\n\nBut for now, I'll commit to moving right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me. There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer. Then, maybe move left towards (4,1).\n\n- But, if I move down to (6,0), and then left, I need to ensure my body doesn't block my path.\n\n- Also, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2). I need to be careful not to get too close to it.\n\nWait, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, snakes can grow, so I don't know if the enemy is moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats there.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,0):\n\n- Current position: (6,1)\n\n- Move down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1) or up towards other apples.\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my body will be longer, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nWait, since my body is growing, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach. Perhaps try to go for the apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nBut that's farther away, and there might be more risks involved.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Down is (6,0), which is an apple.\n\nLeft is (5,1), then (4,1), which is an apple, but near enemy at (4,2).\n\nUp is (6,2), then (6,3), and so on.\n\nRight is (7,1), then (7,2), etc.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), eat the apple, grow longer, then move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left to (5,1), then (4,1), but I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves. So, I need to make sure that the path I take after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, then consider moving right or up.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, there are more apples spread out. I need a strategy to collect as many as possible without dying.\n\nMaybe I should think about which apples are closest and least risky to get.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is directly below me, no obstacles. I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1).\n\nEnemy at (4,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, maybe move up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nOption 2: Go for (4,1) first.\n\n- Move left to (5,1), then (4,1), eat apple.\n\n- But, enemy is at (4,2), so there might be a risk.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,9) first.\n\n- Move right to (7,1), then up to (7,2), and so on, up to (7,9).\n\n-"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, let's see the situation:\n\nI'm controlling Snake #2, and I'm currently at position (6,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and (9,9) in the top right.\n\nApples are located at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (8,3). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (3,2), with its body at (3,1).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . 2 . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . .

A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, I can see that:\n\n- There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me.\n\n- Another apple at (3,5), which is to the left and up.\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (3,2), with its body at (3,1).\n\n- Other apples are at (5,7), (7,9), and (8,3).\n\nI need to decide whether to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) or try to reach another one.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,3):\n\n- That's directly below me. There's nothing there, so it's safe.\n\n- Then, moving down to (6,2), then (6,1), and finally (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- After eating the apple, my snake will grow longer.\n\nBut I need to be careful because growing longer means my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't run into it while maneuvering.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left or right to position myself for other apples.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\n- Moving left from (6,4) to (5,4), then to (4,4), but I need to see if there are any obstacles or apples in that direction.\n\n- Moving right from (6,4) to (7,4), then to (7,5), and so on, towards (7,9). That's a possibility, but it's a longer path.\n\n- Moving up from (6,4) to (6,5), then towards (5,7) or (3,5).\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Going down to (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), and (6,0) seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's position and movement. If the enemy is at (3,2), and its body is at (3,1), it might be moving towards the apple at (3,5).\n\nI need to avoid getting too close to the enemy, especially since if I go left towards (3,5), I might collide with the enemy or its body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider my next move.\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\n1. Move down from (6,4) to (6,3).\n\n2. Then down to (6,2).\n\n3. Then down to (6,1).\n\n4. Then down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows longer, so my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,0), I can consider moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (5,0), then to (4,0), but there are no apples there, and I might be moving away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,0), then up towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (6,0) to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and I can't move there immediately after eating the apple because my tail moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your head moves forward.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my head is at (6,0), and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since the tail has moved forward, it's now at (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would mean my head is where my tail just was, but I need to make sure that my body doesn't block the path.\n\nThis might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,0): 4 steps down from (6,4).\n\n- (3,5): 3 steps left and 1 step up from (6,4).\n\n- (5,7): 1 step left and 3 steps up from (6,4).\n\n- (7,9): 1 step right and 5 steps up from (6,4).\n\n- (8,3): 2 steps right and 1 step down from (6,4).\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (3,2), and its body is at (3,1), I might want to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,0) first is the safest option.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving right towards (8,3), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (6,0), moving right to (7,0), then (8,0), then up to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nBut those are farther away, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (8,3) after (6,0) is a better idea.\n\nLet me plan that:\n\n1. Move down to (6,3).\n\n2. Move down to (6,2).\n\n3. Move down to (6,1).\n\n4. Move down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n5. Move right to (7,0).\n\n6. Move right to (8,0).\n\n7. Move up to (8,1).\n\n8. Move up to (8,2).\n\n9. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can avoid the area with the enemy.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movements, as it might change its position by the time I reach (8,3).\n\nBut for now, focusing on eating (6,0) and then (8,3) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (8,3) directly from (6,4).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,4), moving right to (7,4), then (8,4), then down to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's only three steps.\n\nBut wait, is there anything in the way?\n\nLooking at the board, at (7,4) and (8,4), there doesn't seem to be anything.\n\nSo, that could work.\n\nAfter eating (8,3), I can consider moving up towards (7,9) or down towards (6,0).\n\nBut (6,0) is already eaten, so maybe moving up towards (7,9).\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nComparing this to the previous plan, going for (8,3) first seems faster, as it's only three moves away, whereas going down to (6,0) is four moves down.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritizing (8,3) first makes more sense in terms of efficiency.\n\nAfter eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0), but since I've already eaten it, maybe moving up towards (7,9).\n\nBut wait, (6,0) is already eaten in this scenario, so I don't need to go there again.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nLet me think about the possible paths after eating (8,3):\n\n- Moving up to (8,4), then (8,5), (8,6), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\n- Or moving left to (7,3), then up towards (7,9).\n\nEither way, I need to plan carefully to avoid running into the enemy or my own"

Eating one apple doesn't remove the others.\n\nWait, no, in Snake games, eating one apple removes that specific apple.\n\nSo, if I eat (8,3), (8,3) is removed, and the apple at (6,0) remains.\n\nSo, after eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,3) to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,3), I can move right to (9,3), then up to (9,4), (9,5), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far in that direction.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for (6,0) first, as initially thought.\n\nLet me compare the two options:\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Path: Down to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n\n- After eating (6,0), move right to (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the second apple.\n\nOption 2: Go for (8,3) first.\n\n- Path: Right to (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3).\n\n- After eating (8,3), move down to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the next apple.\n\nComparing the two, Option 2 seems shorter in terms of moves to reach the first apple.\n\nAlso, it allows me to cover more ground towards the center of the board, where there are other apples.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 2 is better.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy's movement.\n\nIf the enemy is moving towards (3,5), which is in the opposite direction, it should not interfere with my path to (8,3).\n\nTherefore, I think I'll go with Option 2: head for (8,3) first.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right, to (7,5).\n\nThen, continue right to (8,5), down to (8,4), and (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can decide based on the board state and the enemy's position.\n\nBut for now, I'll commit to moving right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

Another one at (7,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize the apple directly above me at (7,6), since it's the closest and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nLet me think about the path to (7,6):\n\nFrom (7,5), I just need to move up to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a straight move up, and there don't seem to be any obstacles there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow longer, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without bumping into my own tail.\n\nOnce I have that apple, maybe I can aim for the apple at (8,3), which is to the right and down from my current position.\n\nWait, but (8,3) is not directly adjacent, and there might be a longer path to it.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (8,5), then up to (8,6), and then to (7,6) to eat the apple, but that seems inefficient.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. The apple is at (7,6), directly above me.\n\nSo, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6) should be safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nPerhaps then I can move right to (8,6), then down to (8,5), and so on, towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nAlternatively, I could move up towards (7,7), but there isn't an apple there immediately.\n\nLet me look at the board again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is left and up from my current position.\n\nAnd the apple at (7,9) is up and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next after the apple directly above me.\n\nBut first, I need to confirm the positions.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board state, there's an apple at (7,7), not at (5,7). Let me correct that.\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, the apple at (5,7) is at column 5, row 7.\n\nI'm at (7,5), so that's up and to the left.\n\nWait, no, columns increase to the right, rows increase upwards.\n\nSo, (7,5) is towards the top-right part of the board.\n\n(5,7) is actually left and up from my position.\n\nWait, let's clarify the coordinates.\n\nGiven that (0,0) is bottom-left, and (9,9) is top-right.\n\nSo, increasing Y is up, increasing X is right.\n\nI'm at (7,5), which is in the middle-right.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (5,7)\n\n- (6,0)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (8,3)\n\nSo, (3,5) is left, same Y.\n\n(5,7) is left and up.\n\n(6,0) is down and left.\n\n(7,9) is up.\n\n(8,3) is right and down.\n\nThe apple directly above me is at (7,6).\n\nSo, moving up to (7,6) seems straightforward.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can move right to (8,6), then down to (8,5), then (8,4), then (8,3) to eat that apple.\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up towards (7,7), then (7,8), (7,9) to eat the apple at (7,9).\n\nBut that might take more moves, and I need to be careful not to run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,3) next is a better idea.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1. Move up to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Move right to (8,6).\n\n3. Move down to (8,5).\n\n4. Move down to (8,4).\n\n5. Move down to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems like a clear path with no immediate obstacles.\n\nI need to make sure that as I grow, I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, starting by moving up to (7,6) seems like the best first step.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

There are apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1). Oh, wait, (4,1) is an apple, but there's also an enemy snake at (4,2), which is snake #1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . .

There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer. Then, maybe move left towards (4,1).\n\n- But, if I move down to (6,0), and then left, I need to ensure my body doesn't block my path.\n\n- Also, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2). I need to be careful not to get too close to it.\n\nWait, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, snakes can grow, so I don't know if the enemy is moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats there.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,0):\n\n- Current position: (6,1)\n\n- Move down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1) or up towards other apples.\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my body will be longer, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nWait, since my body is growing, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach. Perhaps try to go for the apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nBut that's farther away, and there might be more risks involved.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Down is (6,0), which is an apple.\n\nLeft is (5,1), then (4,1), which is an apple, but near enemy at (4,2).\n\nUp is (6,2), then (6,3), and so on.\n\nRight is (7,1), then (7,2), etc.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), eat the apple, grow longer, then move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left to (5,1), then (4,1), but I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves. So, I need to make sure that the path I take after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, then consider moving right or up.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, there are more apples spread out. I need a strategy to collect as many as possible without dying.\n\nMaybe I should think about which apples are closest and least risky to get.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is directly below me, no obstacles. I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1).\n\nEnemy at (4,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, maybe move up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nOption 2: Go for (4,1) first.\n\n- Move left to (5,1), then (4,1), eat apple.\n\n- But, enemy is at (4,2), so there might be a risk.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,9) first.\n\n- Move right to (7,1), then up to (7,2), and so on, up to (7,9).\n\n-"

Move down from (6,2) to (6,1).\n\n2. Then down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows longer, so my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,0), I can consider moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (5,0), then to (4,0), but there are no apples there, and I might be moving away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,0), then up towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (6,0) to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and I can't move there immediately after eating the apple because my tail moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves first, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my snake is longer, and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I move up from (6,0) to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since I've grown, my tail remains at (6,1), and the rest of the body shifts.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me recall: in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your head moves forward.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my head is at (6,0), and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since the tail has moved forward, it's now at (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would mean my head is where my tail just was, but I need to make sure that my body doesn't block the path.\n\nThis might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,0): 2 steps down from (6,2).\n\n- (4,1): 2 steps left and 1 step down from (6,2).\n\n- (3,5): 3 steps left and 3 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (5,7): 1 step left and 5 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (7,9): 1 step right and 7 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (8,3): 2 steps right and 1 step down from (6,2).\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (4,1), and its body is at (4,2), I might want to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,0) first is the safest option.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving right towards (8,3), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (6,0), moving right to (7,0), then (8,0), then up to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nBut those are farther away, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (8,3) after (6,0) is a better idea.\n\nLet me plan that:\n\n1.

Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can avoid the area with the enemy.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movements, as it might change its position by the time I reach (8,3).\n\nBut for now, focusing on eating (6,0) and then (8,3) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (8,3) directly from (6,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,2), moving right to (7,2), then (8,2), then down to (8,1), then (8,0), then up to (8,1) again, which is redundant.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, from (6,2), moving right to (7,2), then (8,2), then down to (8,1), then (8,0), but that's going down, which might not be the most efficient path.\n\nPerhaps it's better to first move down to (6,1), then right to (7,1), then (8,1), then up to (8,2), then (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems more direct.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Move down to (6,1).\n\n2. Move right to (7,1).\n\n3. Move right to (8,1).\n\n4. Move up to (8,2).\n\n5. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I can consider my next move.\n\nAt that point, I would have eaten two apples, and my snake would be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nBut for now, focusing on"

A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nFrom this, I can see that:\n\n- There's an apple directly above me at (7,6).\n\n- Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (7,9), and (8,3).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first. The apple directly above me at (7,6) seems like the easiest to reach. I can move up one step to get it without any immediate obstacles.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,4), and its body is at (3,3). It might be moving towards the apple at (3,5). I need to be careful not to cross paths with it.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left. Another one at (7,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should prioritize the apple directly above me at (7,6), since it's the closest and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nLet me think about the path to (7,6):\n\nFrom (7,5), I just need to move up to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a straight move up, and there don't seem to be any obstacles there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow longer, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without bumping into my own tail.\n\nOnce I have that apple, maybe I can aim for the apple at (8,3), which is to the right and down from my current position.\n\nWait, but (8,3) is not directly adjacent, and there might be a longer path to it.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (8,5), then up to (8,6), and then to (7,6) to eat the apple, but that seems inefficient.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. The apple is at (7,6), directly above me.\n\nSo, moving up from (7,5) to (7,6) should be safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider my next move.\n\nPerhaps then I can move right to (8,6), then down to (8,5), and so on, towards the apple at (8,3).\n\nAlternatively, I could move up towards (7,7), but there isn't an apple there immediately.\n\nLet me look at the board again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,7) is at (5,7), which is left and up from my current position.\n\nAnd the apple at (7,9) is up and to the right.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next after the apple directly above me.\n\nBut first, I need to confirm the positions.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board state, there's an apple at (7,7), not at (5,7). Let me correct that.\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, the apple at (5,7) is at column 5, row 7.\n\nI'm at (7,5), so that's up and to the left.\n\nWait, no, columns increase to the right, rows increase upwards.\n\nSo, (7,5) is towards the top-right part of the board.\n\n(5,7) is actually left and up from my position.\n\nWait, let's clarify the coordinates.\n\nGiven that (0,0) is bottom-left, and (9,9) is top-right.\n\nSo, increasing Y is up, increasing X is right.\n\nI'm at (7,5), which is in the middle-right.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (5,7)\n\n- (6,0)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (8,3)\n\nSo, (3,5) is left, same Y.\n\n(5,7) is left and up.\n\n(6,0) is down and left.\n\n(7,9) is up.\n\n(8,3) is right and down.\n\nThe apple directly above me is at (7,6).\n\nSo, moving up to (7,6) seems straightforward.\n\nAfter that, perhaps I can move right to (8,6), then down to (8,5), then (8,4), then (8,3) to eat that apple.\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up towards (7,7), then (7,8), (7,9) to eat the apple at (7,9).\n\nBut that might take more moves, and I need to be careful not to run into the enemy or my own tail.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,3) next is a better idea.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1. Move up to (7,6) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Move right to (8,6).\n\n3. Move down to (8,5).\n\n4. Move down to (8,4).\n\n5.

There are apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1). Oh, wait, (4,1) is an apple, but there's also an enemy snake at (4,2), which is snake #1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me. There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.

I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1).

That's a possibility, but it's a longer path.\n\n- Moving up from (6,4) to (6,5), then towards (5,7) or (3,5).\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Going down to (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), and (6,0) seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's position and movement. If the enemy is at (3,2), and its body is at (3,1), it might be moving towards the apple at (3,5).\n\nI need to avoid getting too close to the enemy, especially since if I go left towards (3,5), I might collide with the enemy or its body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider my next move.\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\n1. Move down from (6,4) to (6,3).\n\n2. Then down to (6,2).\n\n3. Then down to (6,1).\n\n4. Then down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows longer, so my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,0), I can consider moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (5,0), then to (4,0), but there are no apples there, and I might be moving away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,0), then up towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (6,0) to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and I can't move there immediately after eating the apple because my tail moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your head moves forward.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my head is at (6,0), and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since the tail has moved forward, it's now at (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would mean my head is where my tail just was, but I need to make sure that my body doesn't block the path.\n\nThis might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,0): 4 steps down from (6,4).\n\n- (3,5): 3 steps left and 1 step up from (6,4).\n\n- (5,7): 1 step left and 3 steps up from (6,4).\n\n- (7,9): 1 step right and 5 steps up from (6,4).\n\n- (8,3): 2 steps right and 1 step down from (6,4).\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (3,2), and its body is at (3,1), I might want to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,0) first is the safest option.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving right towards (8,3), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (6,0), moving right to (7,0), then (8,0), then up to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nBut those are farther away, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (8,3) after (6,0) is a better idea.\n\nLet me plan that:\n\n1. Move down to (6,3).\n\n2. Move down to (6,2).\n\n3. Move down to (6,1).\n\n4. Move down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n5. Move right to (7,0).\n\n6. Move right to (8,0).\n\n7. Move up to (8,1).\n\n8. Move up to (8,2).\n\n9. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can avoid the area with the enemy.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movements, as it might change its position by the time I reach (8,3).\n\nBut for now, focusing on eating (6,0) and then (8,3) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (8,3) directly from (6,4).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,4), moving right to (7,4), then (8,4), then down to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's only three steps.\n\nBut wait, is there anything in the way?\n\nLooking at the board, at (7,4) and (8,4), there doesn't seem to be anything.\n\nSo, that could work.\n\nAfter eating (8,3), I can consider moving up towards (7,9) or down towards (6,0).\n\nBut (6,0) is already eaten, so maybe moving up towards (7,9).\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nComparing this to the previous plan, going for (8,3) first seems faster, as it's only three moves away, whereas going down to (6,0) is four moves down.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritizing (8,3) first makes more sense in terms of efficiency.\n\nAfter eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0), but since I've already eaten it, maybe moving up towards (7,9).\n\nBut wait, (6,0) is already eaten in this scenario, so I don't need to go there again.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nLet me think about the possible paths after eating (8,3):\n\n- Moving up to (8,4), then (8,5), (8,6), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\n- Or moving left to (7,3), then up towards (7,9).\n\nEither way, I need to plan carefully to avoid running into the enemy or my own"

The apple at (6,0) is directly below me, which seems straightforward. I can move down step by step to reach it without any immediate obstacles.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,3), and its body is at (3,2).

Move right to (7,5).\n\n2. Move right to (8,5).\n\n3. Move down to (8,4).\n\n4. Move down to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nThen, from (8,3), I can consider moving up towards (7,9) or left towards (3,5), but (7,9) is farther away.\n\nAlternatively, I can move down towards (6,0), but since (6,0) is already eaten, maybe not.\n\nWait, no, (6,0) is a separate apple. Eating one apple doesn't remove the others.\n\nWait, no, in Snake games, eating one apple removes that specific apple.\n\nSo, if I eat (8,3), (8,3) is removed, and the apple at (6,0) remains.\n\nSo, after eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,3) to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,3), I can move right to (9,3), then up to (9,4), (9,5), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far in that direction.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for (6,0) first, as initially thought.\n\nLet me compare the two options:\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Path: Down to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n\n- After eating (6,0), move right to (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the second apple.\n\nOption 2: Go for (8,3) first.\n\n- Path: Right to (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3).\n\n- After eating (8,3), move down to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the next apple.\n\nComparing the two, Option 2 seems shorter in terms of moves to reach the first apple.\n\nAlso, it allows me to cover more ground towards the center of the board, where there are other apples.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 2 is better.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy's movement.\n\nIf the enemy is moving towards (3,5), which is in the opposite direction, it should not interfere with my path to (8,3).\n\nTherefore, I think I'll go with Option 2: head for (8,3) first.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right, to (7,5).\n\nThen, continue right to (8,5), down to (8,4), and (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can decide based on the board state and the enemy's position.\n\nBut for now, I'll commit to moving right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

The board is a 10x10 grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions and Goals:**\n   - Determine the current position of the snake's head.\n   - Identify the positions of all apples and enemy snakes.\n   - Understand the board's layout to plan paths effectively.\n\n2. **Prioritize Apple Collection:**\n   - Prioritize apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n   - Plan a sequence of moves to collect the closest apples first.\n\n3. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - Ensure the planned path does not lead to walls, enemy snakes, or the snake's own body.\n   - Consider the growth of the snake after eating an apple to avoid self-collision.\n\n4. **Make Decisions:**\n   - Decide the immediate next move based on the planned path.\n   - Update the plan as the game state changes with each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Define the current position of the snake\ncurrent_position = (7, 5)\n\n# Define the positions of the apples\napples = [(3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), (8,3)]\n\n# Define the position of the enemy snake\nenemy_position = (3,4)\nenemy_body = [(3,3)]\n\n# Define the board size\nboard_size = 10\n\n# Function to check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < board_size and 0 <= y < board_size\n\n# Function to check if a position is safe\ndef is_safe(x, y, snake_body):\n    return is_within_board(x, y) and (x, y) not in snake_body and (x, y) not in enemy_body and (x, y) != enemy_position\n\n# Function to get the next move to reach the target\ndef get_next_move(current, target):\n    cx, cy = current\n    tx, ty = target\n    if cy < ty:\n        return 'UP'\n    elif cy > ty:\n        return 'DOWN'\n    elif cx < tx:\n        return 'RIGHT'\n    elif cx > tx:\n        return 'LEFT'\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Assume the snake's body is only the head for simplicity in this example\nsnake_body = [current_position]\n\n# Choose the closest apple to move towards\nclosest_apple = min(apples, key=lambda pos: abs(pos[0] - current_position[0]) + abs(pos[1] - current_position"

There are apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1). Oh, wait, (4,1) is an apple, but there's also an enemy snake at (4,2), which is snake #1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me. There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.

I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1).

That's a possibility, but it's a longer path.\n\n- Moving up from (6,4) to (6,5), then towards (5,7) or (3,5).\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Going down to (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), and (6,0) seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's position and movement. If the enemy is at (3,2), and its body is at (3,1), it might be moving towards the apple at (3,5).\n\nI need to avoid getting too close to the enemy, especially since if I go left towards (3,5), I might collide with the enemy or its body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider my next move.\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\n1. Move down from (6,4) to (6,3).\n\n2. Then down to (6,2).\n\n3. Then down to (6,1).\n\n4. Then down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows longer, so my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,0), I can consider moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (5,0), then to (4,0), but there are no apples there, and I might be moving away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,0), then up towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (6,0) to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and I can't move there immediately after eating the apple because my tail moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your head moves forward.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my head is at (6,0), and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since the tail has moved forward, it's now at (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would mean my head is where my tail just was, but I need to make sure that my body doesn't block the path.\n\nThis might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,0): 4 steps down from (6,4).\n\n- (3,5): 3 steps left and 1 step up from (6,4).\n\n- (5,7): 1 step left and 3 steps up from (6,4).\n\n- (7,9): 1 step right and 5 steps up from (6,4).\n\n- (8,3): 2 steps right and 1 step down from (6,4).\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (3,2), and its body is at (3,1), I might want to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,0) first is the safest option.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving right towards (8,3), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (6,0), moving right to (7,0), then (8,0), then up to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nBut those are farther away, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (8,3) after (6,0) is a better idea.\n\nLet me plan that:\n\n1. Move down to (6,3).\n\n2. Move down to (6,2).\n\n3. Move down to (6,1).\n\n4. Move down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\n5. Move right to (7,0).\n\n6. Move right to (8,0).\n\n7. Move up to (8,1).\n\n8. Move up to (8,2).\n\n9. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can avoid the area with the enemy.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movements, as it might change its position by the time I reach (8,3).\n\nBut for now, focusing on eating (6,0) and then (8,3) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (8,3) directly from (6,4).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,4), moving right to (7,4), then (8,4), then down to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's only three steps.\n\nBut wait, is there anything in the way?\n\nLooking at the board, at (7,4) and (8,4), there doesn't seem to be anything.\n\nSo, that could work.\n\nAfter eating (8,3), I can consider moving up towards (7,9) or down towards (6,0).\n\nBut (6,0) is already eaten, so maybe moving up towards (7,9).\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nComparing this to the previous plan, going for (8,3) first seems faster, as it's only three moves away, whereas going down to (6,0) is four moves down.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritizing (8,3) first makes more sense in terms of efficiency.\n\nAfter eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0), but since I've already eaten it, maybe moving up towards (7,9).\n\nBut wait, (6,0) is already eaten in this scenario, so I don't need to go there again.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nLet me think about the possible paths after eating (8,3):\n\n- Moving up to (8,4), then (8,5), (8,6), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\n- Or moving left to (7,3), then up towards (7,9).\n\nEither way, I need to plan carefully to avoid running into the enemy or my own"

The apple at (6,0) is directly below me, which seems straightforward. I can move down step by step to reach it without any immediate obstacles.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of the other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,3), and its body is at (3,2).

Move right to (7,5).\n\n2. Move right to (8,5).\n\n3. Move down to (8,4).\n\n4. Move down to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nThen, from (8,3), I can consider moving up towards (7,9) or left towards (3,5), but (7,9) is farther away.\n\nAlternatively, I can move down towards (6,0), but since (6,0) is already eaten, maybe not.\n\nWait, no, (6,0) is a separate apple. Eating one apple doesn't remove the others.\n\nWait, no, in Snake games, eating one apple removes that specific apple.\n\nSo, if I eat (8,3), (8,3) is removed, and the apple at (6,0) remains.\n\nSo, after eating (8,3), I can consider moving down towards (6,0).\n\nBut that would require moving down from (8,3) to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems like a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,3), I can move right to (9,3), then up to (9,4), (9,5), and so on, towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far in that direction.\n\nMaybe it's better to go for (6,0) first, as initially thought.\n\nLet me compare the two options:\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Path: Down to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n\n- After eating (6,0), move right to (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the second apple.\n\nOption 2: Go for (8,3) first.\n\n- Path: Right to (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3).\n\n- After eating (8,3), move down to (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), then left to (7,0), (6,0) to eat the next apple.\n\nComparing the two, Option 2 seems shorter in terms of moves to reach the first apple.\n\nAlso, it allows me to cover more ground towards the center of the board, where there are other apples.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 2 is better.\n\nBut I need to be cautious of the enemy's movement.\n\nIf the enemy is moving towards (3,5), which is in the opposite direction, it should not interfere with my path to (8,3).\n\nTherefore, I think I'll go with Option 2: head for (8,3) first.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right, to (7,5).\n\nThen, continue right to (8,5), down to (8,4), and (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter that, I can decide based on the board state and the enemy's position.\n\nBut for now, I'll commit to moving right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**"

The board is a 10x10 grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions and Goals:**\n   - Determine the current position of the snake's head.\n   - Identify the positions of all apples and enemy snakes.\n   - Understand the board's layout to plan paths effectively.\n\n2. **Prioritize Apple Collection:**\n   - Prioritize apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n   - Plan a sequence of moves to collect the closest apples first.\n\n3. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - Ensure the planned path does not lead to walls, enemy snakes, or the snake's own body.\n   - Consider the growth of the snake after eating an apple to avoid self-collision.\n\n4. **Make Decisions:**\n   - Decide the immediate next move based on the planned path.\n   - Update the plan as the game state changes with each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Define the current position of the snake\ncurrent_position = (7, 5)\n\n# Define the positions of the apples\napples = [(3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), (8,3)]\n\n# Define the position of the enemy snake\nenemy_position = (3,4)\nenemy_body = [(3,3)]\n\n# Define the board size\nboard_size = 10\n\n# Function to check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < board_size and 0 <= y < board_size\n\n# Function to check if a position is safe\ndef is_safe(x, y, snake_body):\n    return is_within_board(x, y) and (x, y) not in snake_body and (x, y) not in enemy_body and (x, y) != enemy_position\n\n# Function to get the next move to reach the target\ndef get_next_move(current, target):\n    cx, cy = current\n    tx, ty = target\n    if cy < ty:\n        return 'UP'\n    elif cy > ty:\n        return 'DOWN'\n    elif cx < tx:\n        return 'RIGHT'\n    elif cx > tx:\n        return 'LEFT'\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Assume the snake's body is only the head for simplicity in this example\nsnake_body = [current_position]\n\n# Choose the closest apple to move towards\nclosest_apple = min(apples, key=lambda pos: abs(pos[0] - current_position[0]) + abs(pos[1] - current_position"

Continue towards (9,5).\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (6,9), I could move right to (7,9), eat the apple, then move down to (7,8), then left to (6,8), and so on, towards another apple.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to box myself in.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to move in a way that allows me to grow my snake without trapping myself.\n\nI should try to keep as much open space as possible.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (6,9), then right to (7,9), then down to (7,8), and so on, seems acceptable.\n\nLet me consider the immediate next move.\n\nI think the best first step is to move up to (6,9) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the situation again.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this multi-apple Snake game problem, we need to strategically navigate the snake to collect apples while avoiding obstacles and the snake's own body. The board is a 10x10 grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions and Goals:**\n   - Determine the current position of the snake's head.\n   - Identify the positions of all apples and enemy snakes.\n   - Understand the board's layout to plan paths effectively.\n\n2. **Prioritize Apple Collection:**\n   - Prioritize apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n   - Plan a sequence of moves to collect the closest apples first.\n\n3. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - Ensure the planned path does not lead to walls, enemy snakes, or the snake's own body.\n   - Consider the growth of the snake after eating an apple to avoid self-collision.\n\n4. **Make Decisions:**\n   - Decide the immediate next move based on the planned path.\n   - Update the plan as the game state changes with each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Define the current position of the snake\ncurrent_position = (6,8)\n\n# Define the positions of the apples\napples = [(5,7), (6,0), (7,9), (8,3), (9,5)]\n\n# Define the position of the enemy snake\nenemy_position = (5,6)\nenemy_body = [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\n# Define the board size\nboard_size = 10\n\n# Function to check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < board_size and 0 <= y < board_size\n\n# Function to check if a position is safe\ndef is_safe(x, y, snake_body):\n    return is_within_board(x, y) and (x, y) not in snake_body and (x, y) not in enemy_body"

There are apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1). Oh, wait, (4,1) is an apple, but there's also an enemy snake at (4,2), which is snake #1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . 2 . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (6,1), which is column 6, row 1. There's an apple at (6,0), directly below me. There's another apple at (4,1), which is two columns to my left. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up**: From (6,1) to (6,2). There's nothing immediately there, but I need to see if moving up leads me closer to an apple without risking running into the enemy or myself.\n\n2. **Down**: From (6,1) to (6,0), which is an apple. If I go down, I'll eat the apple at (6,0) and grow longer. But I need to make sure that growing doesn't cause me to hit something else.\n\n3. **Left**: From (6,1) to (5,1). There's nothing there, but again, I need to see where that leads.\n\n4. **Right**: From (6,1) to (7,1). Again, nothing there, but I should plan ahead.\n\nI should think about which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Another one is at (4,1), which is two columns to my left.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), I eat that apple and grow longer. Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1), but I need to make sure my longer body doesn't get in the way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up or left to position myself better for other apples.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions:\n\n- Apple at (6,0): down\n\n- Apple at (4,1): left two steps\n\n- Apple at (3,5): left three steps and up four steps\n\n- Apple at (5,7): left one step and up six steps\n\n- Apple at (7,9): right one step and up eight steps\n\nGiven that, the closest apples are (6,0) and (4,1).\n\nLet me consider the risks:\n\n- Moving down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer. Then, maybe move left towards (4,1).\n\n- But, if I move down to (6,0), and then left, I need to ensure my body doesn't block my path.\n\n- Also, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2). I need to be careful not to get too close to it.\n\nWait, enemy snake #1 is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, snakes can grow, so I don't know if the enemy is moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple directly below me at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats there.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (6,0):\n\n- Current position: (6,1)\n\n- Move down to (6,0): eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, I can consider moving left towards (4,1) or up towards other apples.\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my body will be longer, so I need to make sure that the next moves don't cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nWait, since my body is growing, I need to plan my path carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach. Perhaps try to go for the apple at (5,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nBut that's farther away, and there might be more risks involved.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Down is (6,0), which is an apple.\n\nLeft is (5,1), then (4,1), which is an apple, but near enemy at (4,2).\n\nUp is (6,2), then (6,3), and so on.\n\nRight is (7,1), then (7,2), etc.\n\nIf I go down to (6,0), eat the apple, grow longer, then move left towards (4,1).\n\nBut, after eating (6,0), my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left to (5,1), then (4,1), but I need to ensure that my growing body doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and your head moves. So, I need to make sure that the path I take after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, then consider moving right or up.\n\nWait, but looking at the board, there are more apples spread out. I need a strategy to collect as many as possible without dying.\n\nMaybe I should think about which apples are closest and least risky to get.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is directly below me, no obstacles. I can safely eat it by moving down.\n\nThen, perhaps moving up or right to look for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,1), but that's near the enemy.\n\nI need to assess the enemy's position.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2), and there's an apple at (4,1). If I move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), I might be getting too close to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, I don't know the enemy's movement pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid that area for now and go for the apple at (6,0).\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but that's where I currently am.\n\nWait, no: from (6,0), moving up to (6,1), but I'm already at (6,1). So, if I move up from (6,0), I'd be moving to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and since I've grown, my tail stays.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves to the new position, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I'm at (6,1), move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\nNow, my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I then move left to (5,0), my body is now at (6,0) and (6,1).\n\nThen, moving left again to (4,0), my body is at (5,0), (6,0), and (6,1).\n\nBut wait, at (4,0), there's no apple, and I might be venturing into unknown territory.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick to going for the closest apples first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nI'm at (6,1). Apples at (3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), and (4,1).\n\nEnemy at (4,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for (6,0) first.\n\n- Move down to (6,0), eat apple, grow longer.\n\n- Then, maybe move up towards (5,7) or right towards (7,9).\n\nOption 2: Go for (4,1) first.\n\n- Move left to (5,1), then (4,1), eat apple.\n\n- But, enemy is at (4,2), so there might be a risk.\n\nOption 3: Go for (7,9) first.\n\n- Move right to (7,1), then up to (7,2), and so on, up to (7,9).\n\n-"

That's a possibility, but it's a longer path.\n\n- Moving up from (6,2) to (6,3), then towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. The closest one is at (6,0), directly below me. Going down to (6,1), then (6,0) seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy's position and movement. If the enemy is at (4,1), and its body is at (4,2), it might be moving towards the apple at (4,1).\n\nI need to avoid getting too close to the enemy, especially since if I go left towards (4,1), I might collide with the enemy or its body.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (6,0) first, since it's closer and there are no immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider my next move.\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\n1. Move down from (6,2) to (6,1).\n\n2. Then down to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake grows longer, so my tail will be at (6,1).\n\nThen, from (6,0), I can consider moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (5,0), then to (4,0), but there are no apples there, and I might be moving away from other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,0), then up towards (7,9).\n\nBut (7,9) is quite far away.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (6,0) to (6,1), but that's where my tail is, and I can't move there immediately after eating the apple because my tail moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, when you move, your head moves first, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my snake is longer, and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nIf I move up from (6,0) to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since I've grown, my tail remains at (6,1), and the rest of the body shifts.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me recall: in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that your tail stays in its last position, and your head moves forward.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,0), my head is at (6,0), and my tail is still at (6,1).\n\nThen, if I move up to (6,1), that's where my tail is, but since the tail has moved forward, it's now at (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would mean my head is where my tail just was, but I need to make sure that my body doesn't block the path.\n\nThis might get complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple:\n\n- (6,0): 2 steps down from (6,2).\n\n- (4,1): 2 steps left and 1 step down from (6,2).\n\n- (3,5): 3 steps left and 3 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (5,7): 1 step left and 5 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (7,9): 1 step right and 7 steps up from (6,2).\n\n- (8,3): 2 steps right and 1 step down from (6,2).\n\nConsidering the enemy is at (4,1), and its body is at (4,2), I might want to avoid that area for now.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,0) first is the safest option.\n\nAfter eating (6,0), I can consider moving right towards (8,3), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (6,0), moving right to (7,0), then (8,0), then up to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) to eat the apple there.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving up towards (5,7) or (7,9).\n\nBut those are farther away, and I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or my own body.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (8,3) after (6,0) is a better idea.\n\nLet me plan that:\n\n1.

Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can avoid the area with the enemy.\n\nAfter that, I can consider going for other apples.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear and that I don't run into any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy's movements, as it might change its position by the time I reach (8,3).\n\nBut for now, focusing on eating (6,0) and then (8,3) seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (8,3) directly from (6,2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (6,2), moving right to (7,2), then (8,2), then down to (8,1), then (8,0), then up to (8,1) again, which is redundant.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, from (6,2), moving right to (7,2), then (8,2), then down to (8,1), then (8,0), but that's going down, which might not be the most efficient path.\n\nPerhaps it's better to first move down to (6,1), then right to (7,1), then (8,1), then up to (8,2), then (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems more direct.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Move down to (6,1).\n\n2. Move right to (7,1).\n\n3. Move right to (8,1).\n\n4. Move up to (8,2).\n\n5. Move up to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,3), I can consider my next move.\n\nAt that point, I would have eaten two apples, and my snake would be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nBut for now, focusing on"

The board is a 10x10 grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions and Goals:**\n   - Determine the current position of the snake's head.\n   - Identify the positions of all apples and enemy snakes.\n   - Understand the board's layout to plan paths effectively.\n\n2. **Prioritize Apple Collection:**\n   - Prioritize apples based on proximity and potential paths.\n   - Plan a sequence of moves to collect the closest apples first.\n\n3. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - Ensure the planned path does not lead to walls, enemy snakes, or the snake's own body.\n   - Consider the growth of the snake after eating an apple to avoid self-collision.\n\n4. **Make Decisions:**\n   - Decide the immediate next move based on the planned path.\n   - Update the plan as the game state changes with each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Define the current position of the snake\ncurrent_position = (7, 5)\n\n# Define the positions of the apples\napples = [(3,5), (5,7), (6,0), (7,9), (8,3)]\n\n# Define the position of the enemy snake\nenemy_position = (3,4)\nenemy_body = [(3,3)]\n\n# Define the board size\nboard_size = 10\n\n# Function to check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < board_size and 0 <= y < board_size\n\n# Function to check if a position is safe\ndef is_safe(x, y, snake_body):\n    return is_within_board(x, y) and (x, y) not in snake_body and (x, y) not in enemy_body and (x, y) != enemy_position\n\n# Function to get the next move to reach the target\ndef get_next_move(current, target):\n    cx, cy = current\n    tx, ty = target\n    if cy < ty:\n        return 'UP'\n    elif cy > ty:\n        return 'DOWN'\n    elif cx < tx:\n        return 'RIGHT'\n    elif cx > tx:\n        return 'LEFT'\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Assume the snake's body is only the head for simplicity in this example\nsnake_body = [current_position]\n\n# Choose the closest apple to move towards\nclosest_apple = min(apples, key=lambda pos: abs(pos[0] - current_position[0]) + abs(pos[1] - current_position"
