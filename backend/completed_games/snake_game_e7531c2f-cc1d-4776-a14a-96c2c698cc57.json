However, if I move directly left to (2, 0) it does not bring me closer to any of these apples compared to staying at (3, 0).\n\nWith the strategic intent to collect more apples and given the y = 0 boundary, the best option is to navigate northwards or eastwards to optimize apple collection.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nTo target the apple at (9, 0), moving left does not make immediate geographical sense towards this apple, but it is a single free step to maneuver if needed later.\n\n**Decided Move:**\nConsidering the overall benefit longer-term, moving to the right (eastwards) seems optimal. It sets a trajectory towards the next closest apple on the x-axis, promotes reaching other apples, and avoids hitting the wall on the west. It will bring me closer to the apple at (9, 0) eventually over several moves.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

In terms of Manhattan distance from (1,5) the closest apple is at (0,2) with a distance of |1\u20130| + |5\u20132| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps. The apple at (6,5) is 5 steps away, while the others are farther.\n\nSince our goal is to get the nearest apple, it makes sense to target the apple at (0,2). From (1,5) we can approach this apple by either moving LEFT to align with the apple\u2019s column or moving DOWN. Consider the two options:\n\n\u2022 If I move LEFT, I go to (0,5). Then the apple at (0,2) is 3 moves directly downward.\n\u2022 If I move DOWN, I go to (1,4). Then I would usually want to move LEFT to adjust into column 0.\n\nIn either case the Manhattan distance reduces optimally. However, the LEFT move directly positions me in column 0\u2014the exact column of the target apple\u2014which seems like an efficient choice.\n\nI also note that our last move was DOWN, so reversing our direction isn\u2019t an issue as long as we don\u2019t head back into our own body. Going UP would actually reverse into where we just came from (at (1,6)), so that option is ruled out.\n\nThus, the safest and most direct path toward the apple at (0,2) is to move LEFT.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
