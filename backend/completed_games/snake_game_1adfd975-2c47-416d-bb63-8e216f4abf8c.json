            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling a snake in this multi-apple Snake game. My snake's ID is 2, and it's currently at position (6,8). The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. \n\nFirst, I should look at where the apples are. There are apples at (9,9), (2,7), (7,1), (3,8), and (3,5). My snake is at (6,8), so I need to see which apple is closest or which direction I should move towards to get an apple without hitting any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (4,3), and its body is empty, so maybe it's just a head. I should make sure I don't move into that position. Also, I need to avoid moving into walls or my own body, but since my last move information shows no body, maybe I just have the head right now.\n\nLooking at my current position, (6,8), I'm on the upper part of the board. The closest apple seems to be at (3,8), which is to the left of me. From (6,8) to (3,8), that's a distance of 3 units to the left along the same y-coordinate. So moving LEFT would take me towards that apple. \n\nAlternatively, there's another apple at (3,5), but that's further away. Another apple is at (2,7), which is diagonally up-left from me but still a bit further. The furthest ones are at (7,1) and (9,9). \n\nSo the immediate choice is between moving towards (3,8) or perhaps another direction. If I move LEFT three times, I can reach (3,8). But I should make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to hit a wall or the enemy. \n\nSince my y-coordinate is 8, moving up would take me to y=9, where there's an apple at (9,9), but that's all the way to the right. However, that's in the opposite direction of (3,8), so it might not be ideal. Also, moving down from y=8 would take me to y=7, where there's an apple at (2,7), but again, that's to the left and down. \n\nWait, from (6,8), moving LEFT once would take me to (5,8), then (4,8), then (3,8). That's three moves to reach that apple. But I should also check if there's anything blocking my path. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is lower on the y-axis, so it's not in the same row. So moving LEFT along y=8 seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move UP to y=9, which is the top row. At (6,9), but is there an apple there? Looking back, the apples at (9,9) and (3,8) are the only ones in the upper areas. So moving UP to (6,9) might not gain me an apple, but I should consider if moving towards (9,9) would be better. From (6,8), moving RIGHT four times would get me to (9,8), then UP to (9,9). But that's a total of five moves, which is longer than moving LEFT three times to (3,8). \n\nSo moving LEFT towards (3,8) seems more efficient. Also, by moving towards (3,8), I might be able to block the enemy snake or prevent it from reaching that apple before me. \n\nI should also be cautious not to move backwards into myself, but since I don't have a body yet, that's not an issue. The main obstacles would be the walls and the enemy. \n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the LEFT, towards (5,8), then continue left towards (3,8) in subsequent moves if possible. \n\nWait, but after moving LEFT once to (5,8), I should check again if there's any new information. But since this is the first move, I just need to decide the direction. \n\nSo to sum up, moving LEFT will take me towards the closest apple at (3,8) without any immediate threats in that path.\n</think>\n\nI should move LEFT to head towards the apple at (3,8).\n\nLEFT"

From (6,8), moving RIGHT four times would get me to (9,8), then UP to (9,9). But that's a total of five moves, which is longer than moving LEFT three times to (3,8). \n\nSo moving LEFT towards (3,8) seems more efficient. Also, by moving towards (3,8), I might be able to block the enemy snake or prevent it from reaching that apple before me. \n\nI should also be cautious not to move backwards into myself, but since I don't have a body yet, that's not an issue. The main obstacles would be the walls and the enemy. \n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the LEFT, towards (5,8), then continue left towards (3,8) in subsequent moves if possible. \n\nWait, but after moving LEFT once to (5,8), I should check again if there's any new information. But since this is the first move, I just need to decide the direction. \n\nSo to sum up, moving LEFT will take me towards the closest apple at (3,8) without any immediate threats in that path.\n</think>\n\nI should move LEFT to head towards the apple at (3,8).\n\nLEFT"

I remember the apples are at (9,9), (2,7), (7,1), (3,8), (3,5). My last move was LEFT, which took me from (6,8) to (4,8) because I wanted to go towards the apple at (3,8). That apple is just one space to the left now.\n\nWait, but I'm at (4,8), so moving LEFT again would take me to (3,8), which is exactly where the apple is. That seems like a good move because I can eat the apple, gain a point, and grow my snake. But I should check if there's any obstacles or enemies in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is pretty far from my current position. The body of snake #1 is empty, so I don't have to worry about colliding with any of its body parts. Also, the walls aren't an issue as (3,8) is well within the 10x10 grid.\n\nSo, moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial. After that, I should think about which apple to go for next. The other nearby apple is at (3,5). Once I eat the one at (3,8), I can head towards (3,5), which is three spaces down. Alternatively, I might consider the apple at (2,7) or (7,1), but those are farther away. For now, focusing on the closest ones makes sense since it's easier to reach them quickly and avoid potential competition.\n\nI should also consider if moving LEFT is the best option or if there's another direction I should take. For instance, if I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that would be moving away from the apples unless there's a reason to go that way. But since there's an apple directly to my left, it's better to go for that.\n\nAnother thing to think about is my own body. If my snake has grown from previous moves, I need to make sure I don't run into myself. Since the last move was LEFT and I'm now at (4,8), the only body part would be at (5,8) if I moved from (6,8) to (5,8) to (4,8). So, moving to (3,8) should be safe because I won't be moving into any of my own body segments.\n\nSo, the plan is to move LEFT to (3,8), collect the apple, and then decide the next step based on where other apples are and the position of the enemy. If I can reach another apple quickly after that, maybe I'll go for it. Otherwise, I might need to position myself defensively or look for the next closest apple.\n\nI think that's it. Moving LEFT now seems like the best move to collect that apple, gain a point, and grow. I don't see any immediate dangers, so I should go for it.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling a snake in this multi-apple Snake game. My snake's ID is 2, and it's currently at position (6,8). The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. \n\nFirst, I should look at where the apples are. There are apples at (9,9), (2,7), (7,1), (3,8), and (3,5). My snake is at (6,8), so I need to see which apple is closest or which direction I should move towards to get an apple without hitting any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (4,3), and its body is empty, so maybe it's just a head. I should make sure I don't move into that position. Also, I need to avoid moving into walls or my own body, but since my last move information shows no body, maybe I just have the head right now.\n\nLooking at my current position, (6,8), I'm on the upper part of the board. The closest apple seems to be at (3,8), which is to the left of me. From (6,8) to (3,8), that's a distance of 3 units to the left along the same y-coordinate. So moving LEFT would take me towards that apple. \n\nAlternatively, there's another apple at (3,5), but that's further away. Another apple is at (2,7), which is diagonally up-left from me but still a bit further. The furthest ones are at (7,1) and (9,9). \n\nSo the immediate choice is between moving towards (3,8) or perhaps another direction. If I move LEFT three times, I can reach (3,8). But I should make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to hit a wall or the enemy. \n\nSince my y-coordinate is 8, moving up would take me to y=9, where there's an apple at (9,9), but that's all the way to the right. However, that's in the opposite direction of (3,8), so it might not be ideal. Also, moving down from y=8 would take me to y=7, where there's an apple at (2,7), but again, that's to the left and down. \n\nWait, from (6,8), moving LEFT once would take me to (5,8), then (4,8), then (3,8). That's three moves to reach that apple. But I should also check if there's anything blocking my path. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is lower on the y-axis, so it's not in the same row. So moving LEFT along y=8 seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move UP to y=9, which is the top row. At (6,9), but is there an apple there? Looking back, the apples at (9,9) and (3,8) are the only ones in the upper areas. So moving UP to (6,9) might not gain me an apple, but I should consider if moving towards (9,9) would be better. From (6,8), moving RIGHT four times would get me to (9,8), then UP to (9,9). But that's a total of five moves, which is longer than moving LEFT three times to (3,8). \n\nSo moving LEFT towards (3,8) seems more efficient. Also, by moving towards (3,8), I might be able to block the enemy snake or prevent it from reaching that apple before me. \n\nI should also be cautious not to move backwards into myself, but since I don't have a body yet, that's not an issue.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling a snake in this multi-apple Snake game. My snake's ID is 2, and it's currently at position (6,8). The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. \n\nFirst, I should look at where the apples are. There are apples at (9,9), (2,7), (7,1), (3,8), and (3,5). My snake is at (6,8), so I need to see which apple is closest or which direction I should move towards to get an apple without hitting any obstacles or the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (4,3), and its body is empty, so maybe it's just a head. I should make sure I don't move into that position. Also, I need to avoid moving into walls or my own body, but since my last move information shows no body, maybe I just have the head right now.\n\nLooking at my current position, (6,8), I'm on the upper part of the board. The closest apple seems to be at (3,8), which is to the left of me. From (6,8) to (3,8), that's a distance of 3 units to the left along the same y-coordinate. So moving LEFT would take me towards that apple. \n\nAlternatively, there's another apple at (3,5), but that's further away. Another apple is at (2,7), which is diagonally up-left from me but still a bit further. The furthest ones are at (7,1) and (9,9). \n\nSo the immediate choice is between moving towards (3,8) or perhaps another direction. If I move LEFT three times, I can reach (3,8). But I should make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to hit a wall or the enemy. \n\nSince my y-coordinate is 8, moving up would take me to y=9, where there's an apple at (9,9), but that's all the way to the right. However, that's in the opposite direction of (3,8), so it might not be ideal. Also, moving down from y=8 would take me to y=7, where there's an apple at (2,7), but again, that's to the left and down. \n\nWait, from (6,8), moving LEFT once would take me to (5,8), then (4,8), then (3,8). That's three moves to reach that apple. But I should also check if there's anything blocking my path. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is lower on the y-axis, so it's not in the same row. So moving LEFT along y=8 seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move UP to y=9, which is the top row. At (6,9), but is there an apple there? Looking back, the apples at (9,9) and (3,8) are the only ones in the upper areas. So moving UP to (6,9) might not gain me an apple, but I should consider if moving towards (9,9) would be better. From (6,8), moving RIGHT four times would get me to (9,8), then UP to (9,9). But that's a total of five moves, which is longer than moving LEFT three times to (3,8). \n\nSo moving LEFT towards (3,8) seems more efficient. Also, by moving towards (3,8), I might be able to block the enemy snake or prevent it from reaching that apple before me. \n\nI should also be cautious not to move backwards into myself, but since I don't have a body yet, that's not an issue. The main obstacles would be the walls and the enemy. \n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the LEFT, towards (5,8), then continue left towards (3,8) in subsequent moves if possible. \n\nWait, but after moving LEFT once to (5,8), I should check again if there's any new information. But since this is the first move, I just need to decide the direction. \n\nSo to sum up, moving LEFT will take me towards the closest apple at (3,8) without any immediate threats in that path.\n</think>\n\nI should move LEFT to head towards the apple at (3,8).\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out what my next move should be as Snake ID 2 on this 10x10 board. So, right now, my snake is at position (4,8). I remember the apples are at (9,9), (2,7), (7,1), (3,8), (3,5). My last move was LEFT, which took me from (6,8) to (4,8) because I wanted to go towards the apple at (3,8). That apple is just one space to the left now.\n\nWait, but I'm at (4,8), so moving LEFT again would take me to (3,8), which is exactly where the apple is. That seems like a good move because I can eat the apple, gain a point, and grow my snake. But I should check if there's any obstacles or enemies in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is pretty far from my current position. The body of snake #1 is empty, so I don't have to worry about colliding with any of its body parts. Also, the walls aren't an issue as (3,8) is well within the 10x10 grid.\n\nSo, moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial. After that, I should think about which apple to go for next. The other nearby apple is at (3,5). Once I eat the one at (3,8), I can head towards (3,5), which is three spaces down. Alternatively, I might consider the apple at (2,7) or (7,1), but those are farther away. For now, focusing on the closest ones makes sense since it's easier to reach them quickly and avoid potential competition.\n\nI should also consider if moving LEFT is the best option or if there's another direction I should take. For instance, if I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that would be moving away from the apples unless there's a reason to go that way. But since there's an apple directly to my left, it's better to go for that.\n\nAnother thing to think about is my own body. If my snake has grown from previous moves, I need to make sure I don't run into myself. Since the last move was LEFT and I'm now at (4,8), the only body part would be at (5,8) if I moved from (6,8) to (5,8) to (4,8). So, moving to (3,8) should be safe because I won't be moving into any of my own body segments.\n\nSo, the plan is to move LEFT to (3,8), collect the apple, and then decide the next step based on where other apples are and the position of the enemy. If I can reach another apple quickly after that, maybe I'll go for it. Otherwise, I might need to position myself defensively or look for the next closest apple.\n\nI think that's it. Moving LEFT now seems like the best move to collect that apple, gain a point, and grow. I don't see any immediate dangers, so I should go for it.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

But I should make sure that moving LEFT won't cause me to hit a wall or the enemy. \n\nSince my y-coordinate is 8, moving up would take me to y=9, where there's an apple at (9,9), but that's all the way to the right.

That's three moves to reach that apple. But I should also check if there's anything blocking my path. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is lower on the y-axis, so it's not in the same row. So moving LEFT along y=8 seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can move UP to y=9, which is the top row. At (6,9), but is there an apple there? Looking back, the apples at (9,9) and (3,8) are the only ones in the upper areas. So moving UP to (6,9) might not gain me an apple, but I should consider if moving towards (9,9) would be better. From (6,8), moving RIGHT four times would get me to (9,8), then UP to (9,9). But that's a total of five moves, which is longer than moving LEFT three times to (3,8). \n\nSo moving LEFT towards (3,8) seems more efficient. Also, by moving towards (3,8), I might be able to block the enemy snake or prevent it from reaching that apple before me. \n\nI should also be cautious not to move backwards into myself, but since I don't have a body yet, that's not an issue. The main obstacles would be the walls and the enemy. \n\nTherefore, my next move should be to the LEFT, towards (5,8), then continue left towards (3,8) in subsequent moves if possible. \n\nWait, but after moving LEFT once to (5,8), I should check again if there's any new information. But since this is the first move, I just need to decide the direction. \n\nSo to sum up, moving LEFT will take me towards the closest apple at (3,8) without any immediate threats in that path.\n</think>\n\nI should move LEFT to head towards the apple at (3,8).\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out what my next move should be as Snake ID 2 on this 10x10 board. So, right now, my snake is at position (4,8). I remember the apples are at (9,9), (2,7), (7,1), (3,8), (3,5). My last move was LEFT, which took me from (6,8) to (4,8) because I wanted to go towards the apple at (3,8). That apple is just one space to the left now.\n\nWait, but I'm at (4,8), so moving LEFT again would take me to (3,8), which is exactly where the apple is. That seems like a good move because I can eat the apple, gain a point, and grow my snake. But I should check if there's any obstacles or enemies in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake #1 is at (2,3), which is pretty far from my current position. The body of snake #1 is empty, so I don't have to worry about colliding with any of its body parts. Also, the walls aren't an issue as (3,8) is well within the 10x10 grid.\n\nSo, moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial. After that, I should think about which apple to go for next. The other nearby apple is at (3,5). Once I eat the one at (3,8), I can head towards (3,5), which is three spaces down. Alternatively, I might consider the apple at (2,7) or (7,1), but those are farther away. For now, focusing on the closest ones makes sense since it's easier to reach them quickly and avoid potential competition.\n\nI should also consider if moving LEFT is the best option or if there's another direction I should take. For instance, if I move DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), that would be moving away from the apples unless there's a reason to go that way. But since there's an apple directly to my left, it's better to go for that.\n\nAnother thing to think about is my own body. If my snake has grown from previous moves, I need to make sure I don't run into myself. Since the last move was LEFT and I'm now at (4,8), the only body part would be at (5,8) if I moved from (6,8) to (5,8) to (4,8). So, moving to (3,8) should be safe because I won't be moving into any of my own body segments.\n\nSo, the plan is to move LEFT to (3,8), collect the apple, and then decide the next step based on where other apples are and the position of the enemy. If I can reach another apple quickly after that, maybe I'll go for it. Otherwise, I might need to position myself defensively or look for the next closest apple.\n\nI think that's it. Moving LEFT now seems like the best move to collect that apple, gain a point, and grow. I don't see any immediate dangers, so I should go for it.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The board is a 10x10 grid, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My goal is to collect apples to gain points without dying by hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, let me look at the positions of the apples. They are at (9,9), (2,7), (7,1), (3,5), and (8,8). That gives me multiple targets to aim for. My current position is (2,8), so I need to plan which apple to go for next.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, Snake #1 is at (2,3) with no body listed, so it's probably just the head. Since it's at (2,3), that's several units below me, so I don't think it's an immediate threat unless it starts moving towards me.\n\nThe board state shows that there's an apple at (2,7), which is right above my current position. That seems like a nearby target. Moving up from (2,8) to (2,7) would allow me to collect that apple and gain a point. But wait, looking back, the user's previous move was to the LEFT from (6,8) to (4,8), aiming for the apple at (3,8). Hmm, perhaps that's a better target because it's closer and moving left from (4,8) to (3,8) gets me that apple.\n\nWait, let me confirm the current state. The last move information says the direction was LEFT, rationale was to go from (6,8) to (4,8) towards the apple at (3,8). So, perhaps the user previously moved LEFT, but now from (4,8), the next move should be to continue towards (3,8). That makes sense because moving LEFT from (4,8) would take me to (3,8), where there's an apple. So, that's a good next step.\n\nAre there any obstacles? Let me check the board. From (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8) doesn't have any walls or other snakes in the way. Enemy snake is at (2,3), which is far away. So, that should be safe.\n\nOnce I collect the apple at (3,8), I'll gain a point and grow.

The one at (3,8) is already gone since I just ate it. So, I need to choose between the others. \n\nFirst, nearby apples would be (2,7) and (8,8). Let me check their positions relative to me. From (3,8), moving to (2,7) would require moving LEFT and DOWN, but that's a diagonal move, which isn't allowed in standard snake games. Similarly, (8,8) is to the RIGHT, which is a single move away.\n\nWait, (8,8) is at the same y-level as me but higher x. So, moving RIGHT once would take me to (4,8), then to (5,8), and so on up to (8,8). That's four moves away. Alternatively, (2,7) is two units to the LEFT and one down, but that would require moving LEFT twice and DOWN once, which might be more efficient, but let me check if there's a closer apple.\n\nAlternatively, (8,8) is directly to the RIGHT of my current position, so moving RIGHT once would take me to (4,8), which is empty.
