They remain a non-threat as they are distant from my immediate zone.\n\n5. **Strategic Path:**\n   - Considering I\u2019m closer to (4, 6), it's strategic to move UP twice to quickly reach and consume this apple.\n   - Avoiding unnecessary conflict and keeping safe, the path to (4, 6) is clear without any immediate danger.\n\n6. **Future Considerations:**\n   - After reaching the apple at (4, 6), reassess the board for the next closest apple.\n   - Continue monitoring movements from Snake #2 to ensure any sudden directions do not overlap with my planned route.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP\n\nLet's proceed by moving UP to get closer to the apple at (4, 6). We'll reevaluate once the apple is acquired."
