After collecting this apple, the snake will need to reassess the situation to decide the next move. The apple at (7, 8) is to the right and could be a good target, but it's close to the wall, which could be risky if the snake grows too long and can't turn in time. The apple at (4, 4) is to the left and down, but moving towards it would put the snake in proximity to the enemy snake, which is currently at (4, 5).\n\nTherefore, the best course of action after collecting the apple at (5, 8) would be to turn right and aim for the apple at (7, 8), as it is the next closest apple and moving towards it would not put the snake in immediate danger of colliding with the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nThe next move to collect the apple at (5, 8) is:\n\nUP\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (5, 8), the snake should prepare to turn right towards the apple at (7, 8). It's important to monitor the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions."
