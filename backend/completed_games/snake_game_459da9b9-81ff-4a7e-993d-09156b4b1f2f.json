The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. From (7,2), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and apple proximity.\n\nUP would take me to (7,3). Is that safe? The board state shows that row 3 is mostly empty. No snakes there. So moving up is safe. Then, is there an apple nearby? The closest apples are (7,1) which is down, (5,4) and (4,1) maybe. Wait, (7,1) is directly below me. If I go UP, I'm moving away from that apple. But maybe there's another apple in the direction I'm going. Let me check the list again. Apples at (2,5), (9,4), (7,1), (5,4), (4,1). So (5,4) is at x=5, y=4. That's two left and two up from my current position. If I go UP to (7,3), then maybe next move towards (5,4). Alternatively, moving LEFT to (6,2) would get me closer to (5,4) but not directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, (7,1) is an apple. If I go DOWN from (7,2) to (7,1), that's an apple. But moving down would take me directly onto the apple. So that's a good move because I can eat the apple and grow. But wait, is there any danger in moving down? Let's check the board. The snake at (9,0) is far away. My own body is only at (7,2) right now. So moving down to (7,1) would be safe. Because there's no other snake there. The apple is at (7,1), so moving down would get me the apple. That's a good point. So why not go down? Because maybe there's a risk of collision with myself after eating? But since I'm just starting, my body is only one segment. So after eating, my body would be two segments. But next move, if I go down, I would be at (7,1), which is the apple, then grow. So the next position would be (7,1) with body at (7,2). Then, the next move, I can move again. So no immediate collision. So moving down to get the apple seems beneficial. But wait, the enemy snake is at (9,0). They might be moving towards other apples. But maybe I should prioritize getting the closest apple first.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (6,2) would take me towards the center. Then, maybe towards (5,4) or (4,1). But (5,4) is two up and two left from (6,2). Hmm. But (4,1) is down and left from (6,2). Not sure. But the immediate apple at (7,1) is right below me. So moving down would get me a point immediately. That's a good move. But wait, the enemy snake is at (9,0). Are they a threat? Their body is empty, so they can't block me. So maybe moving down is safe and gets me a point. Let me check the board again. At (7,1), the apple is there, and the board shows that in row 1, column 7 is an apple. So moving down to (7,1) is safe. Then, after eating, my body would be longer. But since I'm just starting, that's okay. So the best move might be DOWN to get the apple. Then, next turn, I can plan from there. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (6,2) might lead me towards other apples, but the immediate gain is better with DOWN. So I think the best move is DOWN. Let me check again for possible dangers. Are there any snakes in the direction? The enemy snake is at (9,0), which is far away. So moving down is safe. So direction DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \nRationale: Moving down to (7,1) allows me to immediately consume the apple there, gaining a point and growing. This is the closest apple and poses no collision risk since there are no other snakes or obstacles in that direction. Next turn, I can strategize to head towards other apples like (5,4) or (4,1) from the new position.  \n\nDirection: DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (7,1) because I just moved down to eat the apple there. So now my body is two segments: the head at (7,1) and the tail at (7,2). The apples left are (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), and (6,2) was already eaten? Wait, no, the initial list of apples was (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). Wait, in the previous move, the user said apples at (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). But after moving down to (7,1), which was an apple, that apple is now consumed. So the remaining apples are (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2) minus (7,1). Wait, no, the initial setup had apples at (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). But in the previous move, the user's snake was at (7,1) after moving down. Wait, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the apples were at (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). Then, the user's snake was at (7,1) after moving down. So the apple at (7,1) was not in the original list. Wait, that's confusing. Let me recheck the initial setup.\n\nOriginal apples: (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). The user's snake was at (7,1) after moving down. So the apple at (7,1) must have been a typo? Or maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, looking back at the initial board state:\n\nThe board state shows row 1 as \". . . . A . . 1 . .\", which would be (4,1) as an apple. Then, in row 2, there's an A at (6,2). So the apples are at (4,1), (6,2), (2,5), (5,4), (9,4). So the user's previous move was to go down to (7,1), which is their own head position. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in the initial board, the user's snake was at (7,1) after moving down. But the apple at (7,1) wasn't listed. So perhaps there was a mistake in the problem setup. But regardless, according to the current state after the last move, the snake is at (7,1), having eaten the apple there. So now, the remaining apples are the original ones minus (7,1) if that was an apple. But according to the initial list, (7,1) wasn't an apple. So maybe the user's previous move had a mistake. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me try to parse the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem's apples: (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). The board state shows in row 1 (y=1) at x=4 there's an A (4,1), and in row 2 (y=2) at x=6 there's an A (6,2). So the apples are at (4,1), (6,2), (2,5), (5,4), (9,4). So when the user moved down to (7,1), there was no apple there. Wait, but the user's last move rationale said they moved down to eat the apple at (7,1). That must have been a mistake in the problem setup. Because according to the initial apples listed, (7,1) wasn't an apple. So perhaps the problem had an error. But given that the user's last move was to go down to (7,1) and the rationale was to eat an apple there, perhaps in the current state, that apple is now gone. So the remaining apples are the original ones minus (7,1) if it was an apple. But according to the initial list, (7,1) wasn't an apple. So maybe the problem had a typo, and the apple was at (7,1) instead of (6,2). But the board shows (6,2) as an apple. This is confusing. \n\nAssuming that the user's snake is now at (7,1) after moving down, and that the apple at (7,1) was consumed (even though it wasn't in the original list), the remaining apples are (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). But according to the board state, (4,1) and (6,2) are apples. So perhaps the user's previous move had a mistake, but we have to proceed with the current state.\n\nNow, the snake is at (7,1). The body is now two segments: head at (7,1) and tail at (7,2). So possible moves are UP to (7,2), which is the tail. But moving into the tail would cause a collision. So UP is not safe. LEFT to (6,1), RIGHT to (8,1), or DOWN to (7,0). Let's check each direction.\n\nUP: (7,2) is the tail. If I move there, I collide with my own body. So that's a death. So UP is invalid.\n\nLEFT: (6,1). Is that safe? Let's check the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0). Their body is empty. So (6,1) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (8,1). Is there anything there? The board shows row 1, column 8 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nDOWN: (7,0). That's the bottom edge. The board's y=0 is the bottom row. So (7,0) is within the board. Is there anything there? The enemy snake is at (8,0). So (7,0) is safe. No snakes there.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards apples. The remaining apples are (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). Let's see:\n\n- (4,1) is at x=4, y=1. From (7,1), moving left to (6,1) then to (5,1), then left to (4,1) would get to that apple. So moving left three times. But that's a straight path. Alternatively, moving down to (7,0) then left might not be efficient.\n\n- (6,2) is at x=6, y=2. From (7,1), moving up is blocked by own tail. So to get to (6,2), perhaps moving left to (6,1), then up to (6,2). But moving up from (6,1) would be possible next turn. But (6,2) is an apple. So moving left to (6,1) then up to (6,2) would get that apple.\n\n- (5,4) is at x=5, y=4. From (7,1), moving left and then up. But that's a longer path.\n\n- (9,4) is at the top right. Moving right towards (9,1) then up. But that's a longer path.\n\n- (2,5) is far left and up.\n\nSo the closest apples are (4,1) and (6,2). (4,1) is three left from current position. (6,2) is one left and one up. But moving up is blocked by own tail. So to reach (6,2), need to go left first, then up. So moving left to (6,1) would allow next turn to go up to (6,2), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving down to (7,0) then left. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,1) might not be helpful unless heading towards (9,4). But (9,4) is up and right. So moving right and then up. But that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best options are moving left towards (6,1) to approach (6,2) or (4,1), or moving down to (7,0) which is safe but not towards apples.\n\nSo moving left to (6,1) seems better. Then next move can go up to (6,2) to eat the apple there. But need to check if moving left is safe. Are there any snakes in (6,1)? The enemy snake is at (8,0), so (6,1) is safe. So moving left is safe and leads towards the apple at (6,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (7,0) is safe but not towards any apples. So not the best choice.\n\nMoving right to (8,1) is safe but leads towards (9,4), which is further away. But maybe that's a longer-term plan.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (6,1), setting up to go up to (6,2) next turn to eat the apple there. That's the closest apple now. Alternatively, moving left towards (4,1) but that's further.\n\nWait, (4,1) is at x=4, y=1. From (7,1), moving left three times would reach (4,1). But each move left would be (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So three moves. But (6,2) is two moves away (left then up). So (6,2) is closer. So prioritize (6,2).\n\nTherefore, moving left to (6,1) is the best move to approach (6,2). Then next turn, move up to (6,2) to eat that apple.\n\nSo the direction should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \nRationale: Moving left to (6,1) positions me to approach the apple at (6,2) next turn. This path avoids collisions and keeps me on track to consume nearby apples efficiently. Prioritizing the closest accessible apple (6,2) ensures steady growth while avoiding risks from enemy snakes, which are currently distant.  \n\nDirection: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (7,2). The apples are at (2,5), (9,4), (7,1), (5,4), (4,1). The enemy snake is at (9,0) with an empty body, so it's just a head. The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. From (7,2), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety and apple proximity.\n\nUP would take me to (7,3). Is that safe? The board state shows that row 3 is mostly empty. No snakes there. So moving up is safe. Then, is there an apple nearby? The closest apples are (7,1) which is down, (5,4) and (4,1) maybe. Wait, (7,1) is directly below me. If I go UP, I'm moving away from that apple. But maybe there's another apple in the direction I'm going. Let me check the list again. Apples at (2,5), (9,4), (7,1), (5,4), (4,1). So (5,4) is at x=5, y=4. That's two left and two up from my current position. If I go UP to (7,3), then maybe next move towards (5,4). Alternatively, moving LEFT to (6,2) would get me closer to (5,4) but not directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, (7,1) is an apple. If I go DOWN from (7,2) to (7,1), that's an apple. But moving down would take me directly onto the apple. So that's a good move because I can eat the apple and grow. But wait, is there any danger in moving down? Let's check the board. The snake at (9,0) is far away. My own body is only at (7,2) right now. So moving down to (7,1) would be safe. Because there's no other snake there. The apple is at (7,1), so moving down would get me the apple. That's a good point. So why not go down? Because maybe there's a risk of collision with myself after eating? But since I'm just starting, my body is only one segment. So after eating, my body would be two segments. But next move, if I go down, I would be at (7,1), which is the apple, then grow. So the next position would be (7,1) with body at (7,2). Then, the next move, I can move again. So no immediate collision. So moving down to get the apple seems beneficial. But wait, the enemy snake is at (9,0). They might be moving towards other apples. But maybe I should prioritize getting the closest apple first.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (6,2) would take me towards the center. Then, maybe towards (5,4) or (4,1). But (5,4) is two up and two left from (6,2). Hmm. But (4,1) is down and left from (6,2). Not sure. But the immediate apple at (7,1) is right below me. So moving down would get me a point immediately. That's a good move. But wait, the enemy snake is at (9,0). Are they a threat? Their body is empty, so they can't block me. So maybe moving down is safe and gets me a point. Let me check the board again. At (7,1), the apple is there, and the board shows that in row 1, column 7 is an apple. So moving down to (7,1) is safe. Then, after eating, my body would be longer. But since I'm just starting, that's okay. So the best move might be DOWN to get the apple. Then, next turn, I can plan from there. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (6,2) might lead me towards other apples, but the immediate gain is better with DOWN. So I think the best move is DOWN. Let me check again for possible dangers. Are there any snakes in the direction? The enemy snake is at (9,0), which is far away. So moving down is safe. So direction DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN  \nRationale: Moving down to (7,1) allows me to immediately consume the apple there, gaining a point and growing. This is the closest apple and poses no collision risk since there are no other snakes or obstacles in that direction. Next turn, I can strategize to head towards other apples like (5,4) or (4,1) from the new position.  \n\nDirection: DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (7,1) because I just moved down to eat the apple there. So now my body is two segments: the head at (7,1) and the tail at (7,2). The apples left are (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), and (6,2) was already eaten? Wait, no, the initial list of apples was (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). Wait, in the previous move, the user said apples at (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). But after moving down to (7,1), which was an apple, that apple is now consumed. So the remaining apples are (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2) minus (7,1). Wait, no, the initial setup had apples at (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). But in the previous move, the user's snake was at (7,1) after moving down. Wait, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the apples were at (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). Then, the user's snake was at (7,1) after moving down. So the apple at (7,1) was not in the original list. Wait, that's confusing. Let me recheck the initial setup.\n\nOriginal apples: (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). The user's snake was at (7,1) after moving down. So the apple at (7,1) must have been a typo? Or maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, looking back at the initial board state:\n\nThe board state shows row 1 as \". . . . A . . 1 . .\", which would be (4,1) as an apple. Then, in row 2, there's an A at (6,2). So the apples are at (4,1), (6,2), (2,5), (5,4), (9,4). So the user's previous move was to go down to (7,1), which is their own head position. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in the initial board, the user's snake was at (7,1) after moving down. But the apple at (7,1) wasn't listed. So perhaps there was a mistake in the problem setup. But regardless, according to the current state after the last move, the snake is at (7,1), having eaten the apple there. So now, the remaining apples are the original ones minus (7,1) if that was an apple. But according to the initial list, (7,1) wasn't an apple. So maybe the user's previous move had a mistake. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me try to parse the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem's apples: (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). The board state shows in row 1 (y=1) at x=4 there's an A (4,1), and in row 2 (y=2) at x=6 there's an A (6,2). So the apples are at (4,1), (6,2), (2,5), (5,4), (9,4). So when the user moved down to (7,1), there was no apple there. Wait, but the user's last move rationale said they moved down to eat the apple at (7,1). That must have been a mistake in the problem setup. Because according to the initial apples listed, (7,1) wasn't an apple. So perhaps the problem had an error. But given that the user's last move was to go down to (7,1) and the rationale was to eat an apple there, perhaps in the current state, that apple is now gone. So the remaining apples are the original ones minus (7,1) if it was an apple. But according to the initial list, (7,1) wasn't an apple. So maybe the problem had a typo, and the apple was at (7,1) instead of (6,2). But the board shows (6,2) as an apple. This is confusing. \n\nAssuming that the user's snake is now at (7,1) after moving down, and that the apple at (7,1) was consumed (even though it wasn't in the original list), the remaining apples are (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). But according to the board state, (4,1) and (6,2) are apples. So perhaps the user's previous move had a mistake, but we have to proceed with the current state.\n\nNow, the snake is at (7,1). The body is now two segments: head at (7,1) and tail at (7,2). So possible moves are UP to (7,2), which is the tail. But moving into the tail would cause a collision. So UP is not safe. LEFT to (6,1), RIGHT to (8,1), or DOWN to (7,0). Let's check each direction.\n\nUP: (7,2) is the tail. If I move there, I collide with my own body. So that's a death. So UP is invalid.\n\nLEFT: (6,1). Is that safe? Let's check the board. The enemy snake is at (8,0). Their body is empty. So (6,1) is empty. So moving left is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (8,1). Is there anything there? The board shows row 1, column 8 is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nDOWN: (7,0). That's the bottom edge. The board's y=0 is the bottom row. So (7,0) is within the board. Is there anything there? The enemy snake is at (8,0). So (7,0) is safe. No snakes there.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards apples. The remaining apples are (2,5), (9,4), (5,4), (4,1), (6,2). Let's see:\n\n- (4,1) is at x=4, y=1. From (7,1), moving left to (6,1) then to (5,1), then left to (4,1) would get to that apple. So moving left three times. But that's a straight path. Alternatively, moving down to (7,0) then left might not be efficient.\n\n- (6,2) is at x=6, y=2. From (7,1), moving up is blocked by own tail. So to get to (6,2), perhaps moving left to (6,1), then up to (6,2). But moving up from (6,1) would be possible next turn. But (6,2) is an apple. So moving left to (6,1) then up to (6,2) would get that apple.\n\n- (5,4) is at x=5, y=4. From (7,1), moving left and then up. But that's a longer path.\n\n- (9,4) is at the top right. Moving right towards (9,1) then up. But that's a longer path.\n\n- (2,5) is far left and up.\n\nSo the closest apples are (4,1) and (6,2). (4,1) is three left from current position. (6,2) is one left and one up. But moving up is blocked by own tail. So to reach (6,2), need to go left first, then up. So moving left to (6,1) would allow next turn to go up to (6,2), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving down to (7,0) then left. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,1) might not be helpful unless heading towards (9,4). But (9,4) is up and right. So moving right and then up. But that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best options are moving left towards (6,1) to approach (6,2) or (4,1), or moving down to (7,0) which is safe but not towards apples.\n\nSo moving left to (6,1) seems better. Then next move can go up to (6,2) to eat the apple there. But need to check if moving left is safe. Are there any snakes in (6,1)? The enemy snake is at (8,0), so (6,1) is safe. So moving left is safe and leads towards the apple at (6,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (7,0) is safe but not towards any apples. So not the best choice.\n\nMoving right to (8,1) is safe but leads towards (9,4), which is further away. But maybe that's a longer-term plan.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT to (6,1), setting up to go up to (6,2) next turn to eat the apple there. That's the closest apple now. Alternatively, moving left towards (4,1) but that's further.\n\nWait, (4,1) is at x=4, y=1. From (7,1), moving left three times would reach (4,1). But each move left would be (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So three moves. But (6,2) is two moves away (left then up). So (6,2) is closer. So prioritize (6,2).\n\nTherefore, moving left to (6,1) is the best move to approach (6,2). Then next turn, move up to (6,2) to eat that apple.\n\nSo the direction should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \nRationale: Moving left to (6,1) positions me to approach the apple at (6,2) next turn. This path avoids collisions and keeps me on track to consume nearby apples efficiently. Prioritizing the closest accessible apple (6,2) ensures steady growth while avoiding risks from enemy snakes, which are currently distant.  \n\nDirection: LEFT"
