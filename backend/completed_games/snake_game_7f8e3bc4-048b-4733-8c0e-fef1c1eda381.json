I can move up to try to get to the apple at (6, 9) or (9, 9), but I need to be careful not to run into snake #1.\n2. I can continue moving down to try to get to the apple at (6, 4).\n3. I can move left or right, but I don't think this is the best move.\n\nConsidering my options, I think it's best to move down to try to get to the apple at (6, 4). This move seems relatively safe, and it gives me a clear goal to work towards.\n\nHowever, I also notice that snake #1 is at position (1, 7) with body at [(1, 8), (2, 8)]. This means that snake #1 is moving left or down, and it's not a threat to me at the moment.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving down, I'll reassess the board and consider moving left to get to the apple at (4, 0) if snake #1 is not moving towards it.

To eventually head toward that, we need to work around the block of our body that\u2019s curbing our rightward movement. Moving RIGHT immediately is not an option because (1,7) is occupied by our body.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN, let\u2019s consider the implications:\n\nMoving UP to (0,8) might later force us to maneuver around the \u201cT\u201d at (1,8) (which looks like an obstacle) that would block our eastward progress. On the other hand, moving DOWN to (0,6) opens up lateral (rightward) progress more comfortably on subsequent turns.\n\nThus, to maintain a safe path and allow us to eventually make our way across to apple (6,6), I\u2019ll steer the snake downward.\n\nStrategy note for the turn after next: Once we\u2019re at (0,6), we can plan a careful path to move right (and then a slight upward tweak if needed) to head in the general direction of (6,6) while keeping clear of both our own body and the enemy snake\u2019s parts.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
