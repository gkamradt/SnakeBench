            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me go through the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the board is a 10x10 grid, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and it's currently at (6,9). There are several apples on the board: at (2,5), (9,9), (0,4), (2,0), and (8,7). Enemy snake #1 is at (6,2) with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nLooking at my position at (6,9), which is on the top row. Since the grid is 10x10, y=9 is the highest. So, my current position is on the right side of the top row. The apples are spread out, but there's one at (9,9) which is the top right corner, two columns to my right. There's also an apple at (8,7), which is just below and to the left of my position.\n\nMy snake is at (6,9). If I move up, that's not possible because y=9 is the maximum, so moving up would take me out of bounds, and I would die. So, I can't move UP. Down would take me to y=8, so (6,8). Left would take me to x=5, y=9, so (5,9). Right would take me to x=7, y=9, but wait, the grid only goes up to x=9, so x=7 is possible, but I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, no, the coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. So, moving right from (6,9) would take me to (7,9). That's still within bounds. But I need to check if there's an apple there or any obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 9 has an apple at (9,9). So moving right to (7,9) would just be empty, I think. The other positions in row 9 are: (8,9) is empty, (9,9) is the apple. So moving right twice would get me to (7,9) and then (8,9), and then (9,9) where the apple is.\n\nAlternatively, moving down would take me to (6,8). Is there anything there? Let me check the board. In row 8, the only apple is at (8,7), which is in row 7, x=8. So row 8 doesn't have any apples. So moving down would just take me to an empty spot.\n\nWait, but I have to think about where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,7), which is to the left and down from my current position. If I move down to (6,8), I can then decide to move left towards (8,7). Alternatively, moving right towards (9,9) is another option.\n\nI also need to be cautious about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (6,2). So it's directly below me on the same x-coordinate, but much lower y. So, if I move down from (6,9) to (6,8), I'm moving towards the enemy, but there's a lot of space in between. I don't think it's an immediate threat unless it starts moving up, but as the game progresses, I should be careful not to collide.\n\nMy goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points. The apple at (9,9) is two moves to the right from my current position, but moving right from (6,9) would go to (7,9), (8,9), and then (9,9). So, that's three moves: right once to (7,9), right again to (8,9), and right once more to get the apple at (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is to the west and down. From (6,9), moving left would take me to (5,9), but that's not towards (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is east-northeast from my current position? No, actually, (8,7) has a higher x than my current x=6, but lower y=7. So to get there, I need to move right and down, but since I'm at y=9, moving down would decrease y.\n\nWait, maybe I should move down first to reach y=8, then perhaps move right towards x=8. But that would take more moves, and I'm not sure if it's worth it compared to just getting the apple at (9,9).\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,2). If I move down towards y=8, I might get closer to it, but I don't think it's a threat yet. However, if both snakes are moving towards each other, we need to avoid collision.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,2), and I'm at (6,9), if I move down, I could potentially collide if the enemy moves up, but since it's only one move, maybe I can get to the apple before any collision happens.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,9) would be a safe move, bringing me closer to the apple at (9,9), which is a good target because it's in the corner and perhaps less contested.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n1. Moving right to (7,9): safe, moving towards apple at (9,9). It would take two more moves after that to reach the apple.\n\n2. Moving down to (6,8): moving towards the center, possibly heading towards the apple at (8,7), but would require more moves and potential risk of enemy encounter.\n\nI think the better option is to move right towards the apple at (9,9). It's a direct path with no obstacles in between, and I can collect it in three moves. Plus, since it's in the corner, maybe the enemy is less likely to go there unless it's also trying to get that apple.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (6,2), which is much lower. It might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately, so that could be a safe target.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left, I could go towards (2,5), but that's much further away, and perhaps not as strategic as taking the closer apples.\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (7,9), which is one step towards the apple at (9,9). Then, in the next moves, I can continue moving right to collect that apple.\n\nI should also consider that moving right might make me reach the apple before the enemy can interfere. Since the enemy is at (6,2), it's far from (9,9), so it's unlikely to reach there before me.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go RIGHT to (7,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me go through the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the board is a 10x10 grid, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and it's currently at (6,9). There are several apples on the board: at (2,5), (9,9), (0,4), (2,0), and (8,7). Enemy snake #1 is at (6,2) with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nLooking at my position at (6,9), which is on the top row. Since the grid is 10x10, y=9 is the highest. So, my current position is on the right side of the top row. The apples are spread out, but there's one at (9,9) which is the top right corner, two columns to my right. There's also an apple at (8,7), which is just below and to the left of my position.\n\nMy snake is at (6,9). If I move up, that's not possible because y=9 is the maximum, so moving up would take me out of bounds, and I would die. So, I can't move UP. Down would take me to y=8, so (6,8). Left would take me to x=5, y=9, so (5,9). Right would take me to x=7, y=9, but wait, the grid only goes up to x=9, so x=7 is possible, but I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting anything.\n\nWait, no, the coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. So, moving right from (6,9) would take me to (7,9). That's still within bounds. But I need to check if there's an apple there or any obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 9 has an apple at (9,9). So moving right to (7,9) would just be empty, I think. The other positions in row 9 are: (8,9) is empty, (9,9) is the apple. So moving right twice would get me to (7,9) and then (8,9), and then (9,9) where the apple is.\n\nAlternatively, moving down would take me to (6,8). Is there anything there? Let me check the board. In row 8, the only apple is at (8,7), which is in row 7, x=8. So row 8 doesn't have any apples. So moving down would just take me to an empty spot.\n\nWait, but I have to think about where the apples are. There's an apple at (8,7), which is to the left and down from my current position. If I move down to (6,8), I can then decide to move left towards (8,7). Alternatively, moving right towards (9,9) is another option.\n\nI also need to be cautious about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (6,2). So it's directly below me on the same x-coordinate, but much lower y. So, if I move down from (6,9) to (6,8), I'm moving towards the enemy, but there's a lot of space in between. I don't think it's an immediate threat unless it starts moving up, but as the game progresses, I should be careful not to collide.\n\nMy goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points. The apple at (9,9) is two moves to the right from my current position, but moving right from (6,9) would go to (7,9), (8,9), and then (9,9). So, that's three moves: right once to (7,9), right again to (8,9), and right once more to get the apple at (9,9).\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,7) is to the west and down. From (6,9), moving left would take me to (5,9), but that's not towards (8,7). Wait, (8,7) is east-northeast from my current position? No, actually, (8,7) has a higher x than my current x=6, but lower y=7. So to get there, I need to move right and down, but since I'm at y=9, moving down would decrease y.\n\nWait, maybe I should move down first to reach y=8, then perhaps move right towards x=8. But that would take more moves, and I'm not sure if it's worth it compared to just getting the apple at (9,9).\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,2). If I move down towards y=8, I might get closer to it, but I don't think it's a threat yet. However, if both snakes are moving towards each other, we need to avoid collision.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,2), and I'm at (6,9), if I move down, I could potentially collide if the enemy moves up, but since it's only one move, maybe I can get to the apple before any collision happens.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (7,9) would be a safe move, bringing me closer to the apple at (9,9), which is a good target because it's in the corner and perhaps less contested.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n1. Moving right to (7,9): safe, moving towards apple at (9,9). It would take two more moves after that to reach the apple.\n\n2. Moving down to (6,8): moving towards the center, possibly heading towards the apple at (8,7), but would require more moves and potential risk of enemy encounter.\n\nI think the better option is to move right towards the apple at (9,9). It's a direct path with no obstacles in between, and I can collect it in three moves. Plus, since it's in the corner, maybe the enemy is less likely to go there unless it's also trying to get that apple.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (6,2), which is much lower. It might not be heading towards (9,9) immediately, so that could be a safe target.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left, I could go towards (2,5), but that's much further away, and perhaps not as strategic as taking the closer apples.\n\nSo, my next move should be to move right to (7,9), which is one step towards the apple at (9,9). Then, in the next moves, I can continue moving right to collect that apple.\n\nI should also consider that moving right might make me reach the apple before the enemy can interfere. Since the enemy is at (6,2), it's far from (9,9), so it's unlikely to reach there before me.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go RIGHT to (7,9).\n</think>\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The closest apple is now directly above me at (2, 5), which is great positioning.\n\nThe enemy snake is still far away at (9, 9), so I have some time to focus on collecting the nearby apples without immediate danger.\n\nStrategy: Since the apple at (2, 5) is directly above me, I'll prioritize reaching that one first. Once I collect it, I'll reassess the situation and decide whether to go for the apple at (0, 4) or the one at (2, 0). The apple at (0, 4) might be a safer choice to avoid potentially trapping myself in the bottom left corner, but I'll make that decision based on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nFor my next move, I'll go UP to collect the apple at (2, 5).\n\nSelf-note for next turn: After collecting the apple at (2, 5), decide whether to prioritize the apple at (0, 4) or the one at (2, 0) based on the enemy snake's position and my own positioning. Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adjust my strategy accordingly to maintain a safe distance and avoid getting trapped.\n\nUP"

Now, I need to decide whether to continue moving right towards (9,9) or consider another direction.\n\nLooking at the board, the next position to the right is (9,9), where there's an apple. Collecting that apple would give me a point and make me grow. That seems beneficial. However, I should check if there are any obstacles or threats in that direction.\n\nSnake #1 is at (5,2), which is quite far away, so I don't think it's an immediate concern. There are other apples, like at (8,7), but that's a few steps down and to the right. If I go down to (8,8), I might be moving away from the apple at (9,9). Alternatively, moving left could take me away from the apple I'm about to collect, which isn't ideal.\n\nSo, the best move seems to be continuing right to (9,9) to collect the apple. I should proceed with that.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.\n\n--End of your thought process.--\n\nThe next move is to the right towards the apple.\n\nRIGHT"
