From enemy snake position (4,6), that apple is just 2 moves away for them.\n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 to (2,6), a safe, unoccupied cell.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the available apples:\n\u2022 (4,4) is 1 step right and 2 steps down from our head. However, enemy snake at (4,6) can get to (4,4) much quicker (in 2 moves) if it goes down.\n\u2022 (0,6) is 3 steps to the left (from (3,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (0,6)). Meanwhile the enemy snake from (4,6) must travel 4 leftward moves to reach (0,6). This means we could secure the apple at (0,6) if we head left.\n\nGiven safety concerns and the contest over the apple at (4,4), our best strategy is to steer toward the less-contested left side of the board. Moving LEFT from (3,6) places us on (2,6) and sets up a clear path to (0,6).\n\nTherefore, our chosen move this turn is to move LEFT.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

By contrast, moving DOWN to (1,0) is safe but places our head one step away from (0,1) (diagonally) and may force an extra move to eventually get the apple. \n\nThus, to maximize our apple collection while staying in the cluster and avoiding our growing body and the enemy snake, our best next move is to go LEFT.\n\nMy strategy for upcoming turns is to continue using adjacent moves to grab the nearby apples (first (0,1) then (1,0) or (3,0) as safely as possible) while keeping an eye on our body\u2019s layout to avoid self-collision.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

However, enemy snake at (4,6) can get to (4,4) much quicker (in 2 moves) if it goes down.\n\u2022 (0,6) is 3 steps to the left (from (3,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (0,6)). Meanwhile the enemy snake from (4,6) must travel 4 leftward moves to reach (0,6).

By contrast, moving DOWN to (1,0) is safe but places our head one step away from (0,1) (diagonally) and may force an extra move to eventually get the apple. \n\nThus, to maximize our apple collection while staying in the cluster and avoiding our growing body and the enemy snake, our best next move is to go LEFT.\n\nMy strategy for upcoming turns is to continue using adjacent moves to grab the nearby apples (first (0,1) then (1,0) or (3,0) as safely as possible) while keeping an eye on our body\u2019s layout to avoid self-collision.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

From enemy snake position (4,6), that apple is just 2 moves away for them.\n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 to (2,6), a safe, unoccupied cell.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the available apples:\n\u2022 (4,4) is 1 step right and 2 steps down from our head. However, enemy snake at (4,6) can get to (4,4) much quicker (in 2 moves) if it goes down.\n\u2022 (0,6) is 3 steps to the left (from (3,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (0,6)). Meanwhile the enemy snake from (4,6) must travel 4 leftward moves to reach (0,6). This means we could secure the apple at (0,6) if we head left.\n\nGiven safety concerns and the contest over the apple at (4,4), our best strategy is to steer toward the less-contested left side of the board. Moving LEFT from (3,6) places us on (2,6) and sets up a clear path to (0,6).\n\nTherefore, our chosen move this turn is to move LEFT.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

By contrast, moving DOWN to (1,0) is safe but places our head one step away from (0,1) (diagonally) and may force an extra move to eventually get the apple. \n\nThus, to maximize our apple collection while staying in the cluster and avoiding our growing body and the enemy snake, our best next move is to go LEFT.\n\nMy strategy for upcoming turns is to continue using adjacent moves to grab the nearby apples (first (0,1) then (1,0) or (3,0) as safely as possible) while keeping an eye on our body\u2019s layout to avoid self-collision.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

There\u2019s no immediate danger from walls, our own body, or the enemy snake (Snake #1, which is in the upper middle of the board), so heading UP should be safe and is also a good step toward our nearest target.\n\nMy decided next move is: UP."

By contrast, moving DOWN to (1,0) is safe but places our head one step away from (0,1) (diagonally) and may force an extra move to eventually get the apple. \n\nThus, to maximize our apple collection while staying in the cluster and avoiding our growing body and the enemy snake, our best next move is to go LEFT.\n\nMy strategy for upcoming turns is to continue using adjacent moves to grab the nearby apples (first (0,1) then (1,0) or (3,0) as safely as possible) while keeping an eye on our body\u2019s layout to avoid self-collision.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

There\u2019s no immediate danger from walls, our own body, or the enemy snake (Snake #1, which is in the upper middle of the board), so heading UP should be safe and is also a good step toward our nearest target.\n\nMy decided next move is: UP."

That\u2019s a clear step toward aligning our x coordinate with the apple\u2019s x value of 4.\n\n\u2022 RIGHT (to (9,3)) and DOWN (to (8,2)) aren\u2019t attractive because RIGHT increases our distance while DOWN would either run into part of our own body or take us away from the apple\u2019s y coordinate.\n\nSince our own body doesn\u2019t occupy (7,3) (our current body segments are at (8,2), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1), etc.) and there\u2019s no interference from the enemy snake in that area, moving LEFT is both safe and effective.\n\nSo our strategy is: Move LEFT now to reduce the horizontal gap toward (4,4) and plan to adjust vertically on subsequent moves.\n\nMy next move: LEFT."

That\u2019s a clear step toward aligning our x coordinate with the apple\u2019s x value of 4.\n\n\u2022 RIGHT (to (9,3)) and DOWN (to (8,2)) aren\u2019t attractive because RIGHT increases our distance while DOWN would either run into part of our own body or take us away from the apple\u2019s y coordinate.\n\nSince our own body doesn\u2019t occupy (7,3) (our current body segments are at (8,2), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1), etc.) and there\u2019s no interference from the enemy snake in that area, moving LEFT is both safe and effective.\n\nSo our strategy is: Move LEFT now to reduce the horizontal gap toward (4,4) and plan to adjust vertically on subsequent moves.\n\nMy next move: LEFT."

I was using the prior turn's body.

Death.\n- DOWN: (1, 6) - Body at (1,6). Death.\n- LEFT: (0, 7) - Body at (0,7). Death.\n- RIGHT: (2, 7) - Body at (2,7). Death.\n\nAlright something is still wrong. Let me reconstruct from scratch. Current position (1,7). Previous position (1,6), direction UP. So, body is now [(1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)].  New head is at (1,7). Then new body is old body plus new head, minus last element. So [(1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)]. This matches my prior calculation. So all directions are death!\n\nThis makes no sense, so let me re-examine the board. The board state provided says that (1,8), (0,7), (1,6), (2,7) are NOT snake. The provided snake body is wrong!!!\n\nThe head is at (1,7) and the board has \"1\" at (1,7). The provided snake body has (1,6) so let's start there. Looking at the board to infer body:\n(1,7) head.\n(1,6) body.\n(2,6) body.\n(2,7) body.\n(2,8) body.\n(1,8) body.\n(1,9) body.\n(0,9) body.\n(0,8) body.\n(0,7) body.\n(0,6) body.\n(0,5) body.\n(1,5) body.\n(2,5) body.\n(2,4) body.\n(3,4) body.\n(4,4) body.\n\nOkay, so now the *ACTUAL* body (as inferred from the given board state) is [(1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)]. The head is (1,7).\n\nNow we can evaluate. The snake has length 17.\nMove options from (1,7):\n- UP: (1,8). Body is at (1,8). Death.\n- DOWN: (1,6). Body is at (1,6). Death.\n- LEFT: (0,7). Body is at (0,7). Death.\n- RIGHT: (2,7). Body is at (2,7). Death.\n\nOkay. There must be something I am missing here. Clearly there is a mistake and I don't see it. I will make a random legal move to avoid dying from inaction.\n\nOkay, wait I see the problem. The problem is that the \"body\" I listed above are ALSO the tail locations from PAST moves! This does not accurately reflect what I can move into! Instead, I can ONLY consider the squares immediately adjacent to my head.\n\nSo, given head at (1,7), and given body at [(1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)].\nI need to construct the new body after the move.\n\nI want to go RIGHT to (2,7). Is that a legal move? The body currently occupies (2,7), so going right leads to death. Let's try DOWN to (1,6). This is ALSO on the body. Death. Lets try LEFT to (0,7). This is ALSO on the body. Death. How about UP to (1,8)? THIS IS ALSO ON THE BODY. Death.\n\nAlright. I am completely stuck. I think that all directions lead to death. I will randomly pick a direction and hope it's a bug in the system.\n\nRIGHT"

Moving UP brings us from (9,6) to (9,7) on our next move, which is an empty square according to the board state. Then in subsequent moves we can reach (9,8) to collect the apple and grow. The other directions present risks: inviting collisions with walls (RIGHT), our own body or putting us off course (LEFT or DOWN). Moreover, enemy snake positions don't interfere with our upward path.\n\nThus, to safely and directly progress toward the apple, our next move is UP.\n\nNext move: UP."
