The text about being at (0, 5) in the last move is incorrect, as I moved to (1, 5).\n\n2. **Objective and Apple Evaluation**:\n   - The apples are at (5, 4), (1, 8), (3, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9).\n   - I'm much closer to the apple at (3, 5), which is directly in line on the same y-coordinate.\n   - The apple at (1, 8) is directly reachable by moving vertically up.\n\n3. **Current Constraints and Threats**:\n   - Snake #2 is positioned at (1, 0) with its body extending to (1, 1), which means it\u2019s far below me and not an immediate threat.\n   - There's no immediate danger from walls or other snakes in my direct vicinity.\n\n4. **Potential Moves**:\n   - **UP**: Moves me to (1, 6), still on a path towards (1, 8), without immediate threat.\n   - **DOWN**: Moves to (1, 4), which doesn't lead towards any apples.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves me to (2, 5), directly towards the apple at (3, 5).\n   - **LEFT**: Not possible as it would take me over my own body.\n\n5. **Strategic Decision**:\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to (2, 5) positions me optimally to potentially grab the apple at (3, 5) on the next move. It keeps me on a safe trajectory without running the risk of collision with Snake #2.\n   - It also keeps open the possibility to adjust my path towards (1, 8) if circumstances change in subsequent moves.\n   \n6. **Conclusion and Next Move**:\n   - The most strategic move is to go **RIGHT** towards the apple at (3, 5), aligning my path with as many apples as possible and avoiding immediate threats.\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"
