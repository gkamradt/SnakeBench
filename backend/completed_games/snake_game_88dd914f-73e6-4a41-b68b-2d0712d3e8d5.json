My snake is at (3, 5), with body [(3, 6), (3, 7)].\n\nApples are at: (2, 5), (3, 4), (6, 9), (0, 1), (4, 9).\n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (3, 3) with body at [(3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)].\n\nPossible moves:\n\n*   LEFT: moves to (2, 5). Safe, eats an apple.\n*   DOWN: moves to (3, 4). Safe, eats an apple.\n*   RIGHT: moves to (4, 5). Safe.\n*   UP: moves to (3, 6). Into my body.\n\nLet's calculate distances to the apples:\n\n*   If I move LEFT and eat an apple, I am at (2, 5):\n    *   (3, 4): distance 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   (6, 9): distance 4 + 4 = 8\n    *   (0, 1): distance 2 + 4 = 6\n    *   (4, 9): distance 2 + 4 = 6\n*   If I move DOWN and eat an apple, I am at (3, 4):\n    *   (2, 5): distance 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   (6, 9): distance 3 + 5 = 8\n    *   (0, 1): distance 3 + 3 = 6\n    *   (4, 9): distance 1 + 5 = 6\n\nMoving left or down is the best options.\n\nNext turn strategy: I will assess the new board state, calculate distances to apples, and then prioritize moves that move closer to the apples while avoiding the other snake and my body.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
