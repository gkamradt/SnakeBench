            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (8,4). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (8,3) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (1,5), (7,4), (8,0), (4,9), and (9,1).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out. The one at (8,0) is directly below me since I'm at (8,4). The apple at (7,4) is to my left, and the one at (4,9) is up and to the left. The other apples are at (1,5) and (9,1), which are a bit further away.\n\nMy last move was None, so I'm just starting or resuming. I need to decide whether to go for the closest apple or maybe a different one that's more strategic.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves from (8,4). I can move UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). But wait, moving DOWN would take me to (8,3), which is where the enemy snake is. That's a bad idea because moving into another snake would make me die. So DOWN is out of the question.\n\nSo, I have three options: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's evaluate each.\n\nUP to (8,5): That's moving towards the top. There's an apple at (1,5), but that's quite a distance away. Also, moving up might take me away from other apples that are closer.\n\nLEFT to (7,4): There's an apple at (7,4), so moving left would let me eat that apple immediately. That would give me a point and make me grow. Plus, it's right next to me, so it's the closest option.\n\nRIGHT to (9,4): Moving right takes me to (9,4). There's an apple at (9,1), which is further down, but (9,4) is just an empty space. Not sure if that's a good move right now.\n\nSo, the immediate benefit is clear: moving LEFT to (7,4) would let me eat the apple there. That seems like the best option because it gives me a point and grows my snake right away. Plus, it doesn't put me in danger since there's no snake or wall there.\n\nI should also consider if moving LEFT would put me in a position where I might hit myself. Since my body is at (8,4) and I'm moving left, I don't have any other body parts in that direction, so that's safe.\n\nAnother thing to think about is the enemy snake. It's at (8,3), so if I move LEFT, I'm moving away from it. If I had moved DOWN, I would have died, but since I'm not doing that, I'm avoiding the enemy. So, moving LEFT seems safe.\n\nI don't see any immediate threats in the other directions. Moving UP or RIGHT doesn't lead to an apple, so it's better to go for the one right in front of me.\n\nSo, my strategy is to prioritize eating apples when possible, especially the closest ones, to gain points and grow quickly. Avoiding enemies and walls is crucial, so I need to make sure my move doesn't put me in danger.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to eat the apple at (7,4).\n</think>\n\nThe next move is LEFT to eat the apple at (7,4), gaining a point and growing safely.\n\nLEFT"
