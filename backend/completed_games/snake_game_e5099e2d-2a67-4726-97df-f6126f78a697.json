Here are the apples available: (2, 1), (2, 2), (9, 0), (3, 2), (1, 7).\n\nThe closest apple to me now is at (9, 0), which is to the right of my current position. However, moving right would put me in a position where I have no easy escape, as moving up from there would lead me into the wall, and moving left or down would risk an encounter with the enemy snake or cause me to retrace my steps, which is not allowed.\n\nThe next closest apple is at (3, 2), which is a bit far and moving towards it would require several turns, increasing the risk of running into the enemy snake or the walls.\n\nGiven these considerations, the safest move seems to be heading towards the apple at (1, 7), which is two moves away. By moving left and then down, I can safely reach this apple without any immediate danger. Additionally, this move allows me to keep a safe distance from the enemy snake and provides me with multiple options for subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: LEFT.\n\nAs a strategy for the next turn, I will plan to move down after reaching (7, 9) to collect the apple at (1, 7)."
