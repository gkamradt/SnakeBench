So our valid moves are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nLooking at the apple positions, the apple at (8,5) is a good target\u2014it\u2019s only 1 step to the left (x: from 9 to 8) and then 2 steps down from (7 to 5). From (9,7), if we move LEFT to (8,7), we are moving directly toward that apple. Moving DOWN would put us at (9,6), which is still safe, but it doesn\u2019t bring us as directly in line with our closest apple.\n\nConsidering safety and the goal of collecting apples, I\u2019ll steer our snake toward (8,5) by choosing LEFT. \n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

Since there's nothing (no snake, no wall) on that space, it's a valid move; however, there's no apple there.\n\n2. **DOWN (2, 5)**:\n   - This move would take you back to your previous position and is, therefore, not strategic.\n\n3. **LEFT (1, 6)**:\n   - This moves you to (1, 6), an empty space, which is valid, but doesn't advance towards another apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT (3, 6)**:\n   - This takes you to (3, 6), which is also an empty space, but again does not lead to an apple.\n\n### Apple Locations\nNext potential apples to consider:\n- (5, 1) - far to the right; not within immediate reach.\n- (8, 5) - also located on the right.\n- (8, 0) - located on the bottom row.\n- (7, 2) - moving to the right again.\n- (2, 0) - is directly down from where I am, can be reached later.\n\n### Enemy Presence\n- The enemy snake is located at (8, 6) with part of its body at (8, 7). Your movement should avoid getting too close to them. Moving down increases your distance from any potential issues with the enemy snake.\n\n### Next Move Decision\nGiven that UP does not provide an apple but is a valid space, and that DOWN leads to an unproductive loop, I\u2019ll avoid those. Moving LEFT or RIGHT may be better but are equally unproductive for immediate collection.\n\nConsidering all options and keeping a safe distance from the enemy while exploring opportunities, I'd prefer to move **LEFT** to (1, 6) to keep options open. \n\n### Final Decision\nNext move: LEFT"

Your movement should avoid getting too close to them. Moving down increases your distance from any potential issues with the enemy snake.\n\n### Next Move Decision\nGiven that UP does not provide an apple but is a valid space, and that DOWN leads to an unproductive loop, I\u2019ll avoid those. Moving LEFT or RIGHT may be better but are equally unproductive for immediate collection.\n\nConsidering all options and keeping a safe distance from the enemy while exploring opportunities, I'd prefer to move **LEFT** to (1, 6) to keep options open. \n\n### Final Decision\nNext move: LEFT"

Since there's nothing (no snake, no wall) on that space, it's a valid move; however, there's no apple there.\n\n2. **DOWN (2, 5)**:\n   - This move would take you back to your previous position and is, therefore, not strategic.\n\n3. **LEFT (1, 6)**:\n   - This moves you to (1, 6), an empty space, which is valid, but doesn't advance towards another apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT (3, 6)**:\n   - This takes you to (3, 6), which is also an empty space, but again does not lead to an apple.\n\n### Apple Locations\nNext potential apples to consider:\n- (5, 1) - far to the right; not within immediate reach.\n- (8, 5) - also located on the right.\n- (8, 0) - located on the bottom row.\n- (7, 2) - moving to the right again.\n- (2, 0) - is directly down from where I am, can be reached later.\n\n### Enemy Presence\n- The enemy snake is located at (8, 6) with part of its body at (8, 7). Your movement should avoid getting too close to them. Moving down increases your distance from any potential issues with the enemy snake.\n\n### Next Move Decision\nGiven that UP does not provide an apple but is a valid space, and that DOWN leads to an unproductive loop, I\u2019ll avoid those. Moving LEFT or RIGHT may be better but are equally unproductive for immediate collection.\n\nConsidering all options and keeping a safe distance from the enemy while exploring opportunities, I'd prefer to move **LEFT** to (1, 6) to keep options open. \n\n### Final Decision\nNext move: LEFT"

Notably, I'm currently safe from any hazard; however, I need to keep an eye on their movements to avoid potential blockages in the future.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most strategic move from (5, 7) should be to move **DOWN** to (5, 6).

The nearest apple remains at **(5, 1)**, which is just one move down from my current position.\n\n### Enemy Snakes:\n- **Enemy Snake #2 Position:** (9, 4) with a body under (9, 3) down to (9, 0) and horizontally at (8, 0) through (8, 2). My current position is still quite distant from enemy territories, suggesting a low risk of immediate confrontation.\n\n### Possible Moves from (5, 2):\n1. **UP (5, 3):** This cell is occupied by my body; therefore, this move is invalid.\n2. **DOWN (5, 1):** This cell contains an apple! Moving here allows me to grow my snake and gain a point.\n3. **LEFT (4, 2):** This cell is unoccupied but does not help me in acquiring any apples immediately.\n4. **RIGHT (6, 2):** The cell is also empty but similarly moves away from the apple.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n- **UP (5, 3):** Invalid, as moving to my own body is not permitted.\n- **DOWN (5, 1):** This is the optimal move since it allows me to gain a point by collecting an apple and will position me for further moves. This will also make my body occupy [(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)] on the next turn.\n- **LEFT (4, 2):** Although legal, it takes me away from the apple and is less strategic.\n- **RIGHT (6, 2):** Similar to left, it detracts from securing the nearest apple. \n\n### Strategic Focus:\nMy goal remains to maximize points, so securing the apple at (5, 1) is critical. Doing so will increase my snake\u2019s length, providing me with more room to maneuver in future turns.\n\nDecided next move: **DOWN.**"

Notably, I'm currently safe from any hazard; however, I need to keep an eye on their movements to avoid potential blockages in the future.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most strategic move from (5, 7) should be to move **DOWN** to (5, 6).

From (7,6) my adjacent moves are:\n\n\u2022 UP to (7,7): While safe, it makes the Manhattan distance 4 (x difference) + 3 (y difference) = 7 moves.\n\u2022 DOWN to (7,5): This reduces the y gap (now 1 instead of 2) but leaves the x gap (still 4), for a total of 5 moves.\n\u2022 LEFT to (6,6): This directly closes the larger gap (x now becomes 3 instead of 4; y remains 2), for a total Manhattan distance of 3+2 = 5 moves.\n\u2022 RIGHT to (8,6): That square is occupied by part of my own body, so it\u2019s not allowed.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN result in equal Manhattan improvements from 6 to 5. However, my strategy is to reduce the larger x gap (from 7 to 3) as soon as possible. Therefore, I choose to move LEFT.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT."
