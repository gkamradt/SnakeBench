Unfortunately, there are no immediate apples on that direct horizontal line, hence a LEFT move now may not be the most optimal for immediate apple collection.\n- Moving RIGHT has no benefit currently as it distances from target apples and moving UP would only serve to distance from most apples.\n- Decision to move DOWN first would immediately aim me towards the apple at (7, 1), collecting it, and then allowing for strategic moves LEFT or further DOWN for subsequent collections.\n\n### Plan:\n- Move DOWN to (7, 6) positioning closer to the apple at (7, 1).\n- On the next turn, evaluate positioning for further strategic harvesting of the apples situated to the left.\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**"

This offers a quick growth opportunity which is crucial for both survival and scoring.\n- **Long-term Consideration**: Start considering after collecting the apple at (8, 7), to move towards the cluster of apples around the (3,x) coordinates, albeit with a strategic route to ensure staying within the game grid and avoiding the enemy snake. \n\n### Next Move:\n- **Move**: Going UP towards (8, 5), and then to (8, 6), finally aiming for the apple at (8, 7) would be the optimal path. The movement up takes advantage of an open path with no immediate obstacles and leads directly to an apple. \n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**"
