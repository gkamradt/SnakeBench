            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,1). There are apples at (3,6), (3,3), (0,6), (1,0), and (0,7). Enemy snake number 1 is at (9,8) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots except maybe snake 1 at (9,8).\n\n- Row 8: dots except snake 1 at (9,8).\n\n- Row 7: apple at (0,7), rest dots.\n\n- Row 6: apples at (0,6) and (3,6).\n\n- Row 5: all dots.\n\n- Row 4: all dots.\n\n- Row 3: apple at (3,3).\n\n- Row 2: all dots.\n\n- Row 1: me at (1,1), dot elsewhere.\n\n- Row 0: apple at (0,6), (1,0), but wait, (0,6) is already in row 6. Maybe (0,6) is at row 6, column 0. And (1,0) is row 0, column 1.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy. Apple at (0,6): is that row 0, column 6 or row 6, column 0? Given that coordinates are (X,Y), with X increasing right and Y increasing up, then (0,6) would be column 0, row 6, which is the bottom row, sixth column.\n\nBut in the board state provided:\n\n- Row 9: all dots except snake 1 at (9,8).\n\n- Row 8: dots except snake 1 at (9,8).\n\n- Row 7: apple at (0,7), which is column 0, row 7.\n\n- Row 6: apples at (0,6) and (3,6).\n\n- Row 5: all dots.\n\n- Row 4: all dots.\n\n- Row 3: apple at (3,3).\n\n- Row 2: all dots.\n\n- Row 1: me at (1,1), which is column 1, row 1.\n\n- Row 0: apple at (0,6)? Wait, (0,6) is already in row 6, column 0. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's (0,1) or something else.\n\nAlso, snake 1 is at (9,8), which is top row, near the right edge.\n\nOkay, focusing on my position: I'm at (1,1). I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings:\n\n- Up from (1,1) is (1,2).\n\n- Down is (1,0), which has an apple.\n\n- Left is (0,1).\n\n- Right is (2,1).\n\nI need to think about which direction to move in to maximize my score while avoiding collisions.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (1,0) to eat the apple.\n\n- That would be a good move because I gain a point and grow in length.\n\n- However, I need to ensure that moving down doesn't lead me into a trap or close to the enemy snake.\n\n- Right now, (1,0) is an apple, and presumably empty otherwise.\n\n- After eating the apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I just started moving, my tail would stay where it is or extend based on the game's rules.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows in length, meaning that your tail stays in place and your head moves forward.\n\nBut in this game, it seems that when you move, your entire snake shifts by one position in the chosen direction.\n\nWait, I need to clarify the game mechanics.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n- If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\n- The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nAssuming that moving onto an apple causes your snake to grow, meaning that your tail stays where it was, and your head moves to the new position.\n\nBut in standard Snake games, the tail moves forward as you move, unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail stays, and the head extends.\n\nWait, perhaps in this game, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays, and your snake is now longer.\n\nBut in terms of movement, each move shifts your snake in the chosen direction, with the tail moving forward as well, unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail stays.\n\nI need to be clear on this to plan my moves properly.\n\nAssuming that when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail stays in place while your head moves forward.\n\nOkay, with that in mind.\n\nSo, if I move down to (1,0), eat the apple, my snake grows, and my tail remains where it was.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure about the initial length of my snake. In standard Snake games, the snake starts with a certain length, but here, it's not specified.\n\nLooking back, in the board state, only your head is shown, so perhaps your snake is initially one unit long.\n\nIn that case, when you eat an apple, you grow, meaning that your snake becomes two units long: your head and your tail.\n\nSo, if I move down to (1,0), eat the apple, now my snake has two parts: head at (1,0) and tail at (1,1).\n\nThen, on the next move, if I move left to (0,0), my head moves to (0,0), and my tail moves from (1,1) to (1,0).\n\nBut wait, that would leave (1,0) occupied by my tail, which is fine, but I need to make sure I don't collide with my tail or other snakes.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that the snake's body occupies multiple cells, and moving onto an apple increases its length.\n\nBut for now, to simplify, I'll assume that the snake grows by one unit when it eats an apple, and its tail remains in place while its head moves.\n\nGiven that, moving down to (1,0) to eat the apple seems like a good idea.\n\nBut I need to plan beyond that. What's my next move after eating the apple?\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,0), my snake is now two units long: head at (1,0) and tail at (1,1).\n\nNow, looking at the board, what's the next apple to go for?\n\nThere's an apple at (0,6), which is on the left side, up.\n\nBut there are multiple apples, and I need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the position of the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,8), which is near the top right corner.\n\nSince it's far away from my current position, it might not be an immediate threat.\n\nBut I need to keep an eye on its movement.\n\nWait, I don't have information about the enemy snake's direction or past moves.\n\nAssuming that the enemy snake also tries to eat apples and avoid collisions.\n\nI need to prioritize eating apples while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (0,6)\n\n- (1,0) \u2013 which I'm about to eat\n\n- (0,7)\n\nI need to think about which apples are accessible without running into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nLet me consider the distances from my current position to each apple.\n\nUsing Manhattan distance since we're dealing with grid movements.\n\nFrom (1,1):\n\n- To (3,6): |3-1| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- To (3,3): |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (0,6): |0-1| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (1,0): |1-1| + |0-1| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- To (0,7): |0-1| + |7-1| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,0) at a distance of 1, which is directly down.\n\nNext closest is (3,3) at a distance of 4.\n\nThen (0,6) at 6, and (3,6) and (0,7) both at 7.\n\nSo, it makes sense to go for (1,0) first, since it's the closest.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake is two units long: head at (1,0), tail at (1,1).\n\nNow, where to go next?\n\nOption to go left to (0,0), but there's no apple"

After collecting the apple at (0, 6), I will reassess the board to decide which apple to go for next, prioritizing safety and proximity.\n\nSince I'm currently at (8, 8), I will move: UP.\n\nAs a reminder for my next turn, after moving up to the apple at (0, 6), I should be ready to move right towards the apple at (3, 6), while continue monitoring the enemy snake's movements."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,1). There are apples at (3,6), (3,3), (0,6), (1,0), and (0,7). The enemy snake number 1 is at (9,8) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots except maybe snake 1 at (9,8).\n\n- Row 8: dots except snake 1 at (9,8).\n\n- Row 7: apple at (0,7), rest dots.\n\n- Row 6: apples at (0,6) and (3,6).\n\n- Row 5: all dots.\n\n- Row 4: all dots.\n\n- Row 3: apple at (3,3).\n\n- Row 2: all dots.\n\n- Row 1: me at (1,1), dot elsewhere.\n\n- Row 0: apple at (1,0), maybe others.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\n1. **Down (decreasing Y coordinate):** From (1,1) to (1,0). There's an apple at (1,0), so I can eat it, grow, and gain a point. But I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple, my snake will be two units long: head at (1,0) and tail at (1,1). Then, I need to plan my next move without colliding with my own tail or other snakes.\n\n2. **Up (increasing Y coordinate):** From (1,1) to (1,2). There's no apple there, and I need to make sure that moving up doesn't lead me into a wall or another snake. I need to see what's ahead in that direction.\n\n3. **Left (decreasing X coordinate):** From (1,1) to (0,1). There's no apple there, and I need to ensure that moving left doesn't lead to a dead end or collision.\n\n4. **Right (increasing X coordinate):** From (1,1) to (2,1). There's no apple there, and again, I need to make sure it's a safe move.\n\nGiven that there's an apple directly down at (1,0), it's tempting to go that way to gain a point. However, I need to consider the consequences and plan a few steps ahead.\n\nLet me think about the board again:\n\n- Apples are at (3,6), (3,3), (0,6), (1,0), and (0,7).\n\n- Enemy snake is at (9,8), which is in the top-right corner.\n\n- My position is (1,1), bottom-left part of the board.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is far away, it's probably not an immediate threat for my current position. But I should still be cautious and avoid moving into areas where it might be heading.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position (1,1):\n\n- (1,0): 1 step down.\n\n- (0,6): 5 steps up and 1 step left.\n\n- (0,7): 6 steps up and 1 step left.\n\n- (3,3): 2 steps right and 2 steps up.\n\n- (3,6): 2 steps right and 5 steps up.\n\nThe closest apple is (1,0), so it makes sense to go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (1,0), my snake will be at (1,0) and (1,1). Then, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the surrounding areas:\n\n- From (1,0), moving left to (0,0): no apple, and I need to see if that leads me anywhere useful.\n\n- Moving right to (2,0): no apple, and possibly towards other apples.\n\n- Moving up to (1,1): that's where my tail is, so I can't move there immediately because it's occupied by my tail.\n\nWait, in snake games, usually, the tail moves as you move forward, but in this game, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, so your snake extends.\n\nAssuming that, after eating (1,0), my snake is at (1,0) and (1,1). If I move left from (1,0) to (0,0), my tail remains at (1,1), and the previous tail moves to (1,0). But I need to confirm if that's how the game works.\n\nLet me refer back to the rules:\n\n- If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n- If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\n- The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nFrom this, it seems that eating an apple makes your snake grow, so your tail stays in place, and your head extends.\n\nBut in standard snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays, and your head moves forward without your tail moving out of that position.\n\nIn this game, it might be similar.\n\nSo, if I'm at (1,1), move down to (1,0) and eat the apple, my snake is now at (1,0) and (1,1). Then, if I move left to (0,0), my snake would be at (0,0) and (1,0), with the tail still at (1,1). Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, in standard snake mechanics, when you move forward, your tail moves forward as well, unless you've eaten an apple, in which case your tail stays in place.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (1,0), my snake is now two units long.\n\nIf I move left to (0,0), my head moves to (0,0), and my tail moves from (1,1) to (1,0), since that's the previous head position.\n\nWait, no. In standard snake mechanics, when you move, the tail moves forward by one step unless you've eaten an apple, in which case the tail stays.\n\nSo, after eating the apple, your snake is longer by one unit.\n\nThen, when you move, your head moves forward, and the tail stays in place unless the movement causes the snake to move such that the tail needs to follow.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of coordinates.\n\nLet's say:\n\n- Initial position: head at (1,1), tail non-existent (since it's length 1).\n\n- Eat apple at (1,0): now snake is at (1,0) and (1,1).\n\n- Move left to (0,0): head moves to (0,0), tail is still at (1,1).\n\nWait, but in standard snake games, when you move, the tail moves forward unless you've grown.\n\nIn this case, since I've grown, the tail stays in place.\n\nSo, after eating the apple, my snake is at (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nIf I move left to (0,0), head moves to (0,0), and tail remains at (1,1).\n\nNow, the snake is at (0,0) and (1,1).\n\nWait, that seems odd because in standard snake games, the body follows the head.\n\nMaybe I need to think of the snake as a queue: when you move forward, the tail (last element) is removed and the head (first element) is added at the new position.\n\nBut when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail, so the snake grows.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- Initial: snake = [(1,1)]\n\n- Move down to (1,0), eat apple: snake = [(1,0), (1,1)]\n\n- Move left to (0,0): snake becomes [(0,0), (1,0)], and (1,1) is no longer part of the snake.\n\nWait, but in standard snake games, when you move, the tail moves forward unless you've eaten an apple.\n\nIn this case, since I've eaten an apple, my snake is now longer, so the tail stays.\n\nBut in the queue analogy, it's removing the tail and adding the head.\n\nMaybe the game mechanics are different here.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll assume that when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and when you move, your tail stays in place.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (1,0), my snake is at (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nThen, if I move left to (0,0), my snake becomes (0,0) and (1,0), with (1,1) no longer part of the snake.\n\nBut that seems like the tail moved to where the head was.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tail remains at (1,1), and the head moves to (0,0), making the snake [(0,0), (1,1)].\n\nThis seems inconsistent with standard snake mechanics.\n\nI need to clarify this to plan my moves properly.\n\nPerhaps I should look for confirmation in the game rules or past moves.\n\nWait, in the last move information, it"
