The neighboring cells are:\n\n\u2022 UP: (8,3) \u2013 it\u2019s free (row 3, column 8 is \".\")  \n\u2022 RIGHT: (9,2) \u2013 that cell is also free  \n\u2022 DOWN: (8,1) \u2013 occupied by enemy snake #2  \n\u2022 LEFT: (7,2) \u2013 contains our own tail (\u201cT\u201d)  \n\nSo the only safe moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at the apples:\n\u2003\u2013 Apple at (8,0) is the closest by Manhattan distance (2), but directly reaching it would require going DOWN through (8,1) where the enemy snake is.  \n\u2003\u2013 Apple at (9,4) is only a couple of moves away if we approach it indirectly. For example, from (8,2) if we go RIGHT to (9,2) and then UP twice we can grab (9,4).  \n\u2003\u2013 The other apples are farther away.\n\nGiven that moving DOWN is not safe, the best strategy is to steer toward (9,4). From (8,2), both UP and RIGHT create viable paths to reach that apple, but moving RIGHT positions us immediately closer horizontally, setting up an easy upward move later.\n\nThus, my next move will be RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Okay, let's think this through carefully.\n\nSince I've already claimed the apple at (7, 2), the next closest apple is at (5, 8). Moving towards that apple seems like a reasonable strategy as it's relatively far away from the enemy snake and the walls, reducing the risk of getting trapped or cornered.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake (#1) at (6, 4) with its body segment at (5, 4). If it starts moving towards me, it could potentially block my path or create a trap. I should aim to maintain a safe distance from it while still going for the apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nMove UP towards the apple at (5, 8) while keeping a watchful eye on the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake starts moving in a way that could potentially trap me, I may need to adjust my path and prioritize survival over claiming that apple.\n\nStrategy for the future:\nAfter reaching (5, 8) or if it becomes unsafe to go there, I should reassess the board and look for the next safest apple target, preferably one that keeps me away from the enemy snake and potential traps. Staying flexible and adapting to the changing board conditions will be crucial for survival and maximizing my score.\n\nNext move: UP"
