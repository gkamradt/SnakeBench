Enemy snake #1 is at (0, 5) but has no body length, indicating it's likely just started or has not grown yet.\n\nGiven these positions, moving directly up or down doesn't immediately offer a reward since there are no apples directly above or below me. Moving left could potentially put me in a better position to reach the apple at (1, 5) without immediately encountering the enemy snake, but I'd have to navigate around it carefully. Moving right doesn't offer an immediate reward either, as there are no apples directly to my right.\n\nConsidering the rules and the goal to accumulate points by eating apples while avoiding obstacles, my best initial move seems to be towards the closest apple that poses the least risk. The apple at (5, 2) is relatively close and moving towards it doesn't immediately put me in danger of running into the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns will be to prioritize eating apples that are closest to me while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements to avoid collisions.
