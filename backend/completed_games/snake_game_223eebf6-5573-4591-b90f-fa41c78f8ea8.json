Based on the last move and the updated snake and apple positions, here is the analysis:\n\n- Nearby objectives:\n  * The apple at (2, 2) remains directly below our position, now only 3 units away.\n\n- Obstacles and surroundings:\n  * No immediate threats from snake #2 or from my own snake body are in the directly adjacent cells.\n\nAnalyzing movement options:\n- UP (2, 6): This move goes away from the nearest apple at (2, 2), and would not help in collecting it.\n- LEFT (1, 5) and RIGHT (3, 5): Both moves are lateral and do not advance towards the target apple (2, 2), although they might position the snake in case other apples are closer in the future but the space is clear for now.\n- DOWN (2, 4): Continues the effective pursuit of the nearby apple at (2, 2), reducing the distance to just 2 units. It appears free from immediate threats and allows future access to other board areas.\n\n**Strategy for this Move:**\n- Keep heading DOWN towards (2, 2) to easily secure the apple. This path offers the shortest route to an apple ensuring growth and point gain.\n- Keep analyzing Snake #2 positions to avoid any potential confrontations in subsequent moves. Preparation to pivot if Snake #2 approaches near (2, 2).\n\n**Decided next move:** DOWN."
