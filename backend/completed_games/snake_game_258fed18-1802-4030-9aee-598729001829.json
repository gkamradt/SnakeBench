The closest apples by absolute distance might not be reachable directly due to potential obstacles or strategic reasons. However, initially, let's calculate and think about the distance to each apple:\n\n- **Apple at (6, 7)**: Starting point (8, 0), moves required: |8-6| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- **Apple at (0, 7)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-7| = 8 + 7 = 15\n- **Apple at (0, 9)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-9| = 8 + 9 = 17\n- **Apple at (3, 8)**: Moves required: |8-3| + |0-8| = 5 + 8 = 13\n- **Apple at (5, 6)**: Moves required: |8-5| + |0-6| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe apples at (6, 7) and (5, 6) seem like the closest possibilities based on distance, needing 9 moves each.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\nTo start moving toward these apples, I will need to prioritize movement along the board without getting near enemy Snake #2 (at 5, 0 now). I can start by moving up or left initially.\n\n- **Avoidance Strategy**: Moving directly to position (5, 0), occupied by Snake #2, would result in a collision. I should avoid that area, perhaps taking a more vertical path initially.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the board state and my starting location, moving upwards to (8, 1) seems safe and keeps the path open toward apples, away from the enemy snake at (5, 0). This also avoids immediate self-risk by not heading towards Snake #2. It sets the stage to maneuver effectively around enemy movements and adjust as needed.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is: **UP**."

The closest apples by absolute distance might not be reachable directly due to potential obstacles or strategic reasons. However, initially, let's calculate and think about the distance to each apple:\n\n- **Apple at (6, 7)**: Starting point (8, 0), moves required: |8-6| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- **Apple at (0, 7)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-7| = 8 + 7 = 15\n- **Apple at (0, 9)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-9| = 8 + 9 = 17\n- **Apple at (3, 8)**: Moves required: |8-3| + |0-8| = 5 + 8 = 13\n- **Apple at (5, 6)**: Moves required: |8-5| + |0-6| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe apples at (6, 7) and (5, 6) seem like the closest possibilities based on distance, needing 9 moves each.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\nTo start moving toward these apples, I will need to prioritize movement along the board without getting near enemy Snake #2 (at 5, 0 now). I can start by moving up or left initially.\n\n- **Avoidance Strategy**: Moving directly to position (5, 0), occupied by Snake #2, would result in a collision. I should avoid that area, perhaps taking a more vertical path initially.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the board state and my starting location, moving upwards to (8, 1) seems safe and keeps the path open toward apples, away from the enemy snake at (5, 0). This also avoids immediate self-risk by not heading towards Snake #2. It sets the stage to maneuver effectively around enemy movements and adjust as needed.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is: **UP**."

The apples at (6, 7) and (5, 6) remain appealing due to their relative closeness.\n  \n- **Threat Assessment**: The enemy snake is at (5, 1), safely away from my current position.

However, advancing upward also maintains modular flexibility allowing reactive decision-making due to limited resistance in the y-coordinates.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\n\nBy moving upwards, I continue facilitating a strategic approach towards the apples while preserving multiple options for further moves. I avoid crowding near the walls or getting too close to the other snake at this point.\n\n**Chosen Move**: **UP**\n\n### Strategy for Next Turns:\n- Continue to observe enemy moves while heading vertically until I can optimize pace toward an apple.\n- Re-evaluate after each move for adaptability against any unseen threats or opportunities."

To avoid this eventuality, my best course of action seems to go upwards and aim for the apple at either (0,7) or even better (0,9) which is further from my opponent. \n\nMy best path would be to go to the left wall and then go up.

This would keep a safe distance from wall, other snakes and keep me closer to apple. I have two apples directly above me in the 0th column and another possible apple at (3, 8) if I move towards top right but that would be little far compared to (0,9) or (0,7).\n\nTherefore, for my next move, I'm planning for a two-phased strategy. First, turn towards the left wall, then move up towards the apple.\n\nMy move: LEFT."

The closest apples by absolute distance might not be reachable directly due to potential obstacles or strategic reasons. However, initially, let's calculate and think about the distance to each apple:\n\n- **Apple at (6, 7)**: Starting point (8, 0), moves required: |8-6| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- **Apple at (0, 7)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-7| = 8 + 7 = 15\n- **Apple at (0, 9)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-9| = 8 + 9 = 17\n- **Apple at (3, 8)**: Moves required: |8-3| + |0-8| = 5 + 8 = 13\n- **Apple at (5, 6)**: Moves required: |8-5| + |0-6| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe apples at (6, 7) and (5, 6) seem like the closest possibilities based on distance, needing 9 moves each.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\nTo start moving toward these apples, I will need to prioritize movement along the board without getting near enemy Snake #2 (at 5, 0 now). I can start by moving up or left initially.\n\n- **Avoidance Strategy**: Moving directly to position (5, 0), occupied by Snake #2, would result in a collision. I should avoid that area, perhaps taking a more vertical path initially.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the board state and my starting location, moving upwards to (8, 1) seems safe and keeps the path open toward apples, away from the enemy snake at (5, 0). This also avoids immediate self-risk by not heading towards Snake #2. It sets the stage to maneuver effectively around enemy movements and adjust as needed.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is: **UP**."

However, I should remain vigilant about its movements. \n\n### Path Analysis:\n\n1. **Towards (6, 7)**:\n   - Current distance: |8-6| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8 moves.\n   - This is a promising route; a direct path involves moving left initially.\n\n2. **Towards (5, 6)**:\n   - Current distance: |8-5| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8 moves.\n   - This is also reachable within a short number of moves.\n\nGiven both options, heading toward (5, 6) provides a slightly more direct path without immediate threats from the enemy snake. However, advancing upward also maintains modular flexibility allowing reactive decision-making due to limited resistance in the y-coordinates.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\n\nBy moving upwards, I continue facilitating a strategic approach towards the apples while preserving multiple options for further moves. I avoid crowding near the walls or getting too close to the other snake at this point.\n\n**Chosen Move**: **UP**\n\n### Strategy for Next Turns:\n- Continue to observe enemy moves while heading vertically until I can optimize pace toward an apple.\n- Re-evaluate after each move for adaptability against any unseen threats or opportunities."

To avoid this eventuality, my best course of action seems to go upwards and aim for the apple at either (0,7) or even better (0,9) which is further from my opponent. \n\nMy best path would be to go to the left wall and then go up.

The closest apples by absolute distance might not be reachable directly due to potential obstacles or strategic reasons. However, initially, let's calculate and think about the distance to each apple:\n\n- **Apple at (6, 7)**: Starting point (8, 0), moves required: |8-6| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- **Apple at (0, 7)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-7| = 8 + 7 = 15\n- **Apple at (0, 9)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-9| = 8 + 9 = 17\n- **Apple at (3, 8)**: Moves required: |8-3| + |0-8| = 5 + 8 = 13\n- **Apple at (5, 6)**: Moves required: |8-5| + |0-6| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe apples at (6, 7) and (5, 6) seem like the closest possibilities based on distance, needing 9 moves each.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\nTo start moving toward these apples, I will need to prioritize movement along the board without getting near enemy Snake #2 (at 5, 0 now). I can start by moving up or left initially.\n\n- **Avoidance Strategy**: Moving directly to position (5, 0), occupied by Snake #2, would result in a collision. I should avoid that area, perhaps taking a more vertical path initially.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the board state and my starting location, moving upwards to (8, 1) seems safe and keeps the path open toward apples, away from the enemy snake at (5, 0). This also avoids immediate self-risk by not heading towards Snake #2. It sets the stage to maneuver effectively around enemy movements and adjust as needed.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is: **UP**."

To avoid this eventuality, my best course of action seems to go upwards and aim for the apple at either (0,7) or even better (0,9) which is further from my opponent. \n\nMy best path would be to go to the left wall and then go up.

The closest apples by absolute distance might not be reachable directly due to potential obstacles or strategic reasons. However, initially, let's calculate and think about the distance to each apple:\n\n- **Apple at (6, 7)**: Starting point (8, 0), moves required: |8-6| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- **Apple at (0, 7)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-7| = 8 + 7 = 15\n- **Apple at (0, 9)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-9| = 8 + 9 = 17\n- **Apple at (3, 8)**: Moves required: |8-3| + |0-8| = 5 + 8 = 13\n- **Apple at (5, 6)**: Moves required: |8-5| + |0-6| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe apples at (6, 7) and (5, 6) seem like the closest possibilities based on distance, needing 9 moves each.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\nTo start moving toward these apples, I will need to prioritize movement along the board without getting near enemy Snake #2 (at 5, 0 now). I can start by moving up or left initially.\n\n- **Avoidance Strategy**: Moving directly to position (5, 0), occupied by Snake #2, would result in a collision. I should avoid that area, perhaps taking a more vertical path initially.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the board state and my starting location, moving upwards to (8, 1) seems safe and keeps the path open toward apples, away from the enemy snake at (5, 0). This also avoids immediate self-risk by not heading towards Snake #2. It sets the stage to maneuver effectively around enemy movements and adjust as needed.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is: **UP**."

I should avoid that area, perhaps taking a more vertical path initially.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the board state and my starting location, moving upwards to (8, 1) seems safe and keeps the path open toward apples, away from the enemy snake at (5, 0).

The closest apples by absolute distance might not be reachable directly due to potential obstacles or strategic reasons. However, initially, let's calculate and think about the distance to each apple:\n\n- **Apple at (6, 7)**: Starting point (8, 0), moves required: |8-6| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- **Apple at (0, 7)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-7| = 8 + 7 = 15\n- **Apple at (0, 9)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-9| = 8 + 9 = 17\n- **Apple at (3, 8)**: Moves required: |8-3| + |0-8| = 5 + 8 = 13\n- **Apple at (5, 6)**: Moves required: |8-5| + |0-6| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe apples at (6, 7) and (5, 6) seem like the closest possibilities based on distance, needing 9 moves each.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\nTo start moving toward these apples, I will need to prioritize movement along the board without getting near enemy Snake #2 (at 5, 0 now). I can start by moving up or left initially.\n\n- **Avoidance Strategy**: Moving directly to position (5, 0), occupied by Snake #2, would result in a collision. I should avoid that area, perhaps taking a more vertical path initially.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the board state and my starting location, moving upwards to (8, 1) seems safe and keeps the path open toward apples, away from the enemy snake at (5, 0).

The closest apples by absolute distance might not be reachable directly due to potential obstacles or strategic reasons. However, initially, let's calculate and think about the distance to each apple:\n\n- **Apple at (6, 7)**: Starting point (8, 0), moves required: |8-6| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- **Apple at (0, 7)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-7| = 8 + 7 = 15\n- **Apple at (0, 9)**: Moves required: |8-0| + |0-9| = 8 + 9 = 17\n- **Apple at (3, 8)**: Moves required: |8-3| + |0-8| = 5 + 8 = 13\n- **Apple at (5, 6)**: Moves required: |8-5| + |0-6| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe apples at (6, 7) and (5, 6) seem like the closest possibilities based on distance, needing 9 moves each.\n\n**Immediate Strategy**:\nTo start moving toward these apples, I will need to prioritize movement along the board without getting near enemy Snake #2 (at 5, 0 now). I can start by moving up or left initially.\n\n- **Avoidance Strategy**: Moving directly to position (5, 0), occupied by Snake #2, would result in a collision. I should avoid that area, perhaps taking a more vertical path initially.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the board state and my starting location, moving upwards to (8, 1) seems safe and keeps the path open toward apples, away from the enemy snake at (5, 0). This also avoids immediate self-risk by not heading towards Snake #2. It sets the stage to maneuver effectively around enemy movements and adjust as needed.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is: **UP**."

Redundant unless repositioning is needed in future iterations.\n\n3. **LEFT**:\n   - Moves to (5, 7).\n   - Brings me closer to the apple at (5, 6). However, the apple isn't directly on this path, so additional move coordination is required.\n\n4. **DOWN**:\n   - Moves to (6, 6).\n   - A strategic move towards the apple at (5, 6) since it aligns with the next possible move to reach and collect that apple assuming enemy snakes don\u2019t interfere.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Immediate Objective**: Move **DOWN** to position closer to the apple at (5, 6). It allows a follow-up move left next turn to acquire this apple barring no interference or obstacles.\n- **Anticipate Movements of Snake #2**: Given its position at (4, 6), monitor if it aims for the apple at (5, 6). This gives us an opportunity to either briefly outmaneuver or disengage depending on its speed.\n- **Look Ahead**: After reaching the apple at (5, 6), check remaining apples' locations, specifically considering the apple at (3, 8) or (3, 1) based on Snake #2's movements and new apple spawns when they occur.\n\nDecided next move: **DOWN**"
