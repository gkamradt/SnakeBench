If I can safely move towards the apple at (1, 8) and cut off snake #2 from it, I could potentially gain more points.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Prioritize moving towards the apple at (1, 8) while keeping an eye on snake #2. If it's not possible to reach the apple at (1, 8) without colliding with snake #2 or the wall, I will move towards the apple at (3, 5) while maintaining a safe distance from snake #2.\n\nDecision: I will check if there is a safe path to the apple at (1, 8) by moving UP. If there is no safe path, I will move towards the apple at (3, 5) while maintaining a safe distance from snake #2, moving RIGHT.\n\nNext move: UP, unless there is a safer option to the left or right."
