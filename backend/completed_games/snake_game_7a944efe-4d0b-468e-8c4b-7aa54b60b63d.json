The safest strategy is to stay clear of distance threats while still moving toward reachable apples.\n\n### Strategy for Next Moves:\n- I will aim to navigate to find apples while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n- I should also avoid backtracking, as it does not contribute to growth.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nGiven the options, moving UP to (5, 7) seems like the best choice, as it opens up my options for the next turn and avoids confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"
