The apple at (2, 9) seems a logical target as moving up would continue to align with long-term apple collection and safety from the enemy snake.\n3. **Long-term Strategy:** Continue to prioritize apple collection while keeping a safe distance from enemy snakes, using vertical movements strategically when close to enemy territory to avoid a head-on collision. \n\n**Decided next move:** UP to secure the apple at (2, 4).

Given the current board state and apple availability, the next feasible target is the apple at (2, 9).\n  \n- **Situation Assessment:**\n  - The apple at (2, 9) is directly above me. Moving UP will continue to align with long-term apple collection and keeps a safe direction away from boundaries and enemy locations.\n  - Other apples are significantly farther away (at (6, 4), (6, 6), and (0, 7)), requiring more complicated planning to navigate towards them safely. The apple at (9, 0) is also not ideal as it would require traveling to the board's boundary and potentially dangerous proximity to enemy paths.\n  - Enemy Snake #2, based on the last known positions ([7,8], [6,8]), appears to be moving horizontally on the upper right quadrant of the board. Currently, they pose no immediate threat to my planned upward route.\n  \n- **Strategic Considerations:**\n  - By ascending further UP, I minimize the risk of collisions and maintain a competitive stance by seeking apples.\n  - The vertical path has no immediate obstacles which allow relatively safe moves, absent sudden changes in enemy trajectory.\n\n- **Tactical Plan:**\n  1. Move UP towards the apple at (2, 9). This progressive move reinforces apple collection while keeping spatial advantage.\n  2. Assess board state after this move to determine if further upward movements are feasible or if changes are required to adapt to enemy movements or other board changes.\n\n- **Next turn advice to self:** Review the enemy's position after moving up, especially focusing on their changes in direction and distance to potentially adjust my following moves to avoid collision risks and strategize my approach towards the next closest apples.\n\n**Decided next move: UP**"
