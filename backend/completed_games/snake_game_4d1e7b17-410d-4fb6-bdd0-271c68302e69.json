It seems like an ideal choice to ensure I keep eating apples and gaining points while avoiding any collision with the enemy snake and myself.\n\nThe enemy snake is moving downwards and away from me, I will have to be mindful of its movements in subsequent turns and avoid its path. In the next turn, after consuming the apple at (9, 7), I'll reassess the situation and plan my next moves accordingly. Provided there are no threats, my next ideal target would be the apple at (8, 4), but I will worry about that after gaining the apple in my current trajectory.\n\nNext move: UP."

With the enemy snake #2 continuing to move downwards, there is no immediate collision concern. The closest apple now is at coordinate (8, 4), however, it's not directly accessible in a single turn. On the other hand, the apple at (9, 3) is directly downward along the wall and would result in me eating it after three moves if I start to go down.\n\nI must also take my positioning into account. After swallowing the apple, I'll be at the uppermost wall, meaning going UP isn't an option. Going RIGHT or LEFT could lead me towards a collision dependent on the enemy snake\u2019s next move.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving DOWN is a logical choice, getting me closer to the apple at (9, 3), whilst keeping maximum maneuverability options open. I\u2019ll continue to monitor the position of the enemy snake as I move towards my target.\n\nNext move: DOWN.\n\n--End of your last move information.--"
