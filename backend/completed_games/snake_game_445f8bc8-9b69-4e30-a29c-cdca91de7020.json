My snake is now longer, and I've gained a point.\n\n### New Board Analysis\n\n- **Apples Left:** (2, 7), (3, 8), (1, 8), (0, 6), (1, 4)\n- **Enemy Snake #2 Position:** Still needs to be considered, though it's currently at (3, 7) with its body trailing from (3, 6).\n\n### Move Options and Analysis\n\n1. **Move Up to (4, 9):**\n   - No apple at (4, 9).\n   - Puts me at the edge of the board, which can be limiting in terms of maneuverability.\n   - Not ideal without an apple target.\n\n2. **Move Right to (5, 8):**\n   - This direction opens up the board further for me.\n   - Brings me closer to the apple at (1, 8) indirectly by keeping my options open.\n   - No immediate threat from enemy snake.\n\n3. **Move Left to (3, 8):**\n   - Gets me closer to the apple at (3, 8), allowing me a chance to capture it soon.\n   - Potential encounter with Snake #2 if it changes direction.\n   - However, (3, 8) is attractive for immediate apple capture.\n\n4. **Move Down to (4, 7):**\n   - Backtracking with no immediate benefit unless strategically retreating.\n   - Not recommended.\n\n### Conclusion and Decision\n\nMoving **LEFT to (3, 8)** is strategically sound given the proximity to an apple. I must be cautious of Snake #2 potentially blocking my path, but obtaining apples should remain the top priority to increase my score. Gaining this apple will also help manage my snake's length growth, keeping me competitive.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\n- After acquiring the apple at (3, 8), assess the next closest apples, likely moving towards (2, 7) or assessing the peripheral apples on the board that might ensure safer pathing.\n- Monitor Snake #2's movements closely to avoid any close encounters.\n- Plan potential escape routes to avoid getting cornered or blocked.\n  \n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

I must be cautious of Snake #2 potentially blocking my path, but obtaining apples should remain the top priority to increase my score. Gaining this apple will also help manage my snake's length growth, keeping me competitive.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\n- After acquiring the apple at (3, 8), assess the next closest apples, likely moving towards (2, 7) or assessing the peripheral apples on the board that might ensure safer pathing.\n- Monitor Snake #2's movements closely to avoid any close encounters.\n- Plan potential escape routes to avoid getting cornered or blocked.\n  \n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

However, it comes with a high risk due to the proximity to Snake #2. This move demands strict attention to Snake #2's next step. If Snake #2 moves into this path, I should adapt by choosing an alternative direction next turn.

However, it comes with a high risk due to the proximity to Snake #2. This move demands strict attention to Snake #2's next step. If Snake #2 moves into this path, I should adapt by choosing an alternative direction next turn. Overall, capitalizing on the apple is critical, with escape options up or further left if conflict arises.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\n- **Post-Acquisition of the Apple:**  \n  - Evaluate Snake #2\u2019s positioning and adjust direction accordingly to larger open spots on the board.\n  - Prioritize moving upward towards (1, 9) next if Snake #2 appears to aim for conflict or remains directly in the path.\n  - Aiming for an apple immediately after increases strategic options while maintaining board center presence for flexibility.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

There's no apple directly there, and it doesn't align with a strategic apple path.\n   - Risks distancing myself from the cluster of apples primarily to the north and west.\n\n3. **Move Left:**\n   - Moving left to (3, 5) doesn't allow for immediate apple collection, but it positions me closer to apples at (3, 7) and (3, 8).\n   - Still maintains proximity to Snake #2, with minimal risk due to its current position.\n\n4. **Move Down:**\n   - Moving down to (4, 4) would backtrack me to a previous position and is unnecessary since no apples are below me.\n\n### Calculating Risk and Reward\n\n- **Risk of Enemy Collision:** Snake #2 is nearby, but it's not in a threatening trajectory since I am focused on upward movement for apple collection.\n- **Apple Path Optimization:** Moving upward is directly aligned with optimal apple acquisition as the two closest apples are aligned vertically above me at (4, 8).\n\n### Conclusion and Decision\n\nThe most strategic move is to move **UP**. This move continues a safe path toward priority apples, keeping my position strong against potential threats and maximizing point collection opportunities.\n\n### Next Turn Strategy\n\nUpon successfully moving to (4, 6), continue to evaluate the path towards (4, 8) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake\u2019s movements. If it starts to move north, consider rerouting for conflict avoidance, possibly moving left if the situation changes.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP"

Its head is directly below the apple I am aiming for.  \n- **Apples:**  \n  - (1, 8): Closest and should be prioritized to gain points and grow the snake.  \n  - Other apples (0, 6), (1, 4), and (4, 2) are further away and not immediate priorities.  \n\n### Available Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **Move Up to (2, 9):**  \n   - Temporarily moving away from the apple, which could be safer if I anticipate Snake #2 taking aggressive action.  \n   - Keeps options open and avoids immediate collision risk.\n\n2. **Move Right to (3, 8):**  \n   - Returns to previous position without gain, and moves away from apple; not ideal.  \n   - Leaves snake close to Snake #2\u2019s body, increasing risk if Snake #2 moves unpredictably.\n\n3. **Move Down to (2, 7):**  \n   - This move is beneath the current apple path and places me directly on Snake #2\u2019s body, leading to an immediate death. Not an option.\n\n4. **Move Left to (1, 8):**  \n   - Moves me towards the apple, which increases my score and size when I capture it.  \n   - Directly places me in close proximity to Snake #2\u2019s head at (1, 7).  \n   - Requires careful participation of Snake #2\u2019s movements, particularly if it continues forward, potentially to (1, 8) should I also choose this path.\n\n### Decision and Rationale\n\nMoving **LEFT to (1, 8)** is the most aggressive move that provides the highest payoff by securing an apple. However, it comes with a high risk due to the proximity to Snake #2. This move demands strict attention to Snake #2's next step. If Snake #2 moves into this path, I should adapt by choosing an alternative direction next turn. Overall, capitalizing on the apple is critical, with escape options up or further left if conflict arises.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\n- **Post-Acquisition of the Apple:**  \n  - Evaluate Snake #2\u2019s positioning and adjust direction accordingly to larger open spots on the board.\n  - Prioritize moving upward towards (1, 9) next if Snake #2 appears to aim for conflict or remains directly in the path.\n  - Aiming for an apple immediately after increases strategic options while maintaining board center presence for flexibility.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

However, it comes with a high risk due to the proximity to Snake #2. This move demands strict attention to Snake #2's next step. If Snake #2 moves into this path, I should adapt by choosing an alternative direction next turn. Overall, capitalizing on the apple is critical, with escape options up or further left if conflict arises.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\n- **Post-Acquisition of the Apple:**  \n  - Evaluate Snake #2\u2019s positioning and adjust direction accordingly to larger open spots on the board.\n  - Prioritize moving upward towards (1, 9) next if Snake #2 appears to aim for conflict or remains directly in the path.\n  - Aiming for an apple immediately after increases strategic options while maintaining board center presence for flexibility.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

There's no immediate threat, as it's still below me and not in a direct path to the apples near me.\n\n### Potential Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **Move Up:**\n   - Moving up takes me to position (4, 6). It doesn't immediately collect an apple, but it sets me on a direct path to the apple at (4, 8).\n   - This is a positive move in terms of positioning for future apple acquisition.\n\n2. **Move Right:**\n   - Moving right takes me to (5, 5). There's no apple directly there, and it doesn't align with a strategic apple path.\n   - Risks distancing myself from the cluster of apples primarily to the north and west.\n\n3. **Move Left:**\n   - Moving left to (3, 5) doesn't allow for immediate apple collection, but it positions me closer to apples at (3, 7) and (3, 8).\n   - Still maintains proximity to Snake #2, with minimal risk due to its current position.\n\n4. **Move Down:**\n   - Moving down to (4, 4) would backtrack me to a previous position and is unnecessary since no apples are below me.\n\n### Calculating Risk and Reward\n\n- **Risk of Enemy Collision:** Snake #2 is nearby, but it's not in a threatening trajectory since I am focused on upward movement for apple collection.\n- **Apple Path Optimization:** Moving upward is directly aligned with optimal apple acquisition as the two closest apples are aligned vertically above me at (4, 8).\n\n### Conclusion and Decision\n\nThe most strategic move is to move **UP**. This move continues a safe path toward priority apples, keeping my position strong against potential threats and maximizing point collection opportunities.\n\n### Next Turn Strategy\n\nUpon successfully moving to (4, 6), continue to evaluate the path towards (4, 8) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake\u2019s movements. If it starts to move north, consider rerouting for conflict avoidance, possibly moving left if the situation changes.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP"

Its head is directly below the apple I am aiming for.  \n- **Apples:**  \n  - (1, 8): Closest and should be prioritized to gain points and grow the snake.  \n  - Other apples (0, 6), (1, 4), and (4, 2) are further away and not immediate priorities.  \n\n### Available Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **Move Up to (2, 9):**  \n   - Temporarily moving away from the apple, which could be safer if I anticipate Snake #2 taking aggressive action.  \n   - Keeps options open and avoids immediate collision risk.\n\n2. **Move Right to (3, 8):**  \n   - Returns to previous position without gain, and moves away from apple; not ideal.  \n   - Leaves snake close to Snake #2\u2019s body, increasing risk if Snake #2 moves unpredictably.\n\n3. **Move Down to (2, 7):**  \n   - This move is beneath the current apple path and places me directly on Snake #2\u2019s body, leading to an immediate death. Not an option.\n\n4. **Move Left to (1, 8):**  \n   - Moves me towards the apple, which increases my score and size when I capture it.  \n   - Directly places me in close proximity to Snake #2\u2019s head at (1, 7).  \n   - Requires careful participation of Snake #2\u2019s movements, particularly if it continues forward, potentially to (1, 8) should I also choose this path.\n\n### Decision and Rationale\n\nMoving **LEFT to (1, 8)** is the most aggressive move that provides the highest payoff by securing an apple. However, it comes with a high risk due to the proximity to Snake #2. This move demands strict attention to Snake #2's next step. If Snake #2 moves into this path, I should adapt by choosing an alternative direction next turn. Overall, capitalizing on the apple is critical, with escape options up or further left if conflict arises.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\n- **Post-Acquisition of the Apple:**  \n  - Evaluate Snake #2\u2019s positioning and adjust direction accordingly to larger open spots on the board.\n  - Prioritize moving upward towards (1, 9) next if Snake #2 appears to aim for conflict or remains directly in the path.\n  - Aiming for an apple immediately after increases strategic options while maintaining board center presence for flexibility.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

Overall, capitalizing on the apple is critical, with escape options up or further left if conflict arises.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\n- **Post-Acquisition of the Apple:**  \n  - Evaluate Snake #2\u2019s positioning and adjust direction accordingly to larger open spots on the board.\n  - Prioritize moving upward towards (1, 9) next if Snake #2 appears to aim for conflict or remains directly in the path.\n  - Aiming for an apple immediately after increases strategic options while maintaining board center presence for flexibility.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

If Snake #2 moves into this path, I should adapt by choosing an alternative direction next turn. Overall, capitalizing on the apple is critical, with escape options up or further left if conflict arises.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\n- **Post-Acquisition of the Apple:**  \n  - Evaluate Snake #2\u2019s positioning and adjust direction accordingly to larger open spots on the board.\n  - Prioritize moving upward towards (1, 9) next if Snake #2 appears to aim for conflict or remains directly in the path.\n  - Aiming for an apple immediately after increases strategic options while maintaining board center presence for flexibility.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"
