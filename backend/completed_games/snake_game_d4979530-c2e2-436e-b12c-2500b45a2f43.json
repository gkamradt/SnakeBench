Looking at the board, the remaining apples are located at (0, 3), (0, 4), (4, 0), and (3, 3). All these apples are located at significant distances away from my current position, and I need to ensure my next moves keep me safe from enemy snakes while positioning for potential future apples.\n3. **Enemy Snakes**: Snake #2 is currently at (6, 7). My movement options will need to navigate to avoid confrontation with it. The enemy is directly one space above me, so moving UP again would mean running into it and losing. Since it is positioned directly over (6, 7), I should avoid any direct vertical moves that lead into its space.\n\nNow let's consider my potential movement options:\n- **MOVE LEFT to (4, 6)**: This places me in an open space with no immediate danger and potential movement options in subsequent turns.\n- **MOVE RIGHT to (6, 6)**: This would be invalid as it would mean colliding with the enemy snake.\n- **MOVE DOWN to (5, 5)**: This would be moving back into my previous position, which is not allowed.\n- **MOVE UP to (5, 7)**: This would run into the enemy snake at (6, 7), which is also invalid.\n\nAssessing all of this, the best option is to move LEFT to (4, 6). This allows me to gain distance from the enemy snake while keeping options open for future movements.\n\nI will set myself up to monitor the situation regarding the apples and the enemy snake closely, and as always, look for opportunities to collect apples while avoiding confrontation.\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

Looking at the board, the remaining apples are located at (0, 3), (0, 4), (4, 0), and (3, 3). All these apples are located at significant distances away from my current position, and I need to ensure my next moves keep me safe from enemy snakes while positioning for potential future apples.\n3. **Enemy Snakes**: Snake #2 is currently at (6, 7).

Since it is positioned directly over (6, 7), I should avoid any direct vertical moves that lead into its space.\n\nNow let's consider my potential movement options:\n- **MOVE LEFT to (4, 6)**: This places me in an open space with no immediate danger and potential movement options in subsequent turns.\n- **MOVE RIGHT to (6, 6)**: This would be invalid as it would mean colliding with the enemy snake.\n- **MOVE DOWN to (5, 5)**: This would be moving back into my previous position, which is not allowed.\n- **MOVE UP to (5, 7)**: This would run into the enemy snake at (6, 7), which is also invalid.\n\nAssessing all of this, the best option is to move LEFT to (4, 6).

All these apples are located at significant distances away from my current position, and I need to ensure my next moves keep me safe from enemy snakes while positioning for potential future apples.\n3. **Enemy Snakes**: Snake #2 is currently at (6, 7). My movement options will need to navigate to avoid confrontation with it. The enemy is directly one space above me, so moving UP again would mean running into it and losing. Since it is positioned directly over (6, 7), I should avoid any direct vertical moves that lead into its space.\n\nNow let's consider my potential movement options:\n- **MOVE LEFT to (4, 6)**: This places me in an open space with no immediate danger and potential movement options in subsequent turns.\n- **MOVE RIGHT to (6, 6)**: This would be invalid as it would mean colliding with the enemy snake.\n- **MOVE DOWN to (5, 5)**: This would be moving back into my previous position, which is not allowed.\n- **MOVE UP to (5, 7)**: This would run into the enemy snake at (6, 7), which is also invalid.\n\nAssessing all of this, the best option is to move LEFT to (4, 6). This allows me to gain distance from the enemy snake while keeping options open for future movements.\n\nI will set myself up to monitor the situation regarding the apples and the enemy snake closely, and as always, look for opportunities to collect apples while avoiding confrontation.\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**."

My primary goal is to gain points by eating apples while also avoiding direct confrontation with enemy snakes.\n3. **Enemy Snakes**: I see that Snake #2 is at (6, 6).

Looking at the board, the remaining apples are located at (0, 3), (0, 4), (4, 0), and (3, 3).

After reaching (2, 3) I will evaluate the next best position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will move DOWN to (2, 3) as planned for my next turn.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."
