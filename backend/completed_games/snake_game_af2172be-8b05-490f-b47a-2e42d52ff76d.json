If I successfully eat an apple, I might consider moving towards another apple if it's safe to do so.\n\nFor now, my goal is to move away from the enemy snake and find a safe path to an apple. I'll keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and be prepared to change my strategy if it moves towards me.\n\nNext turn, I should be prepared to move right if the enemy snake moves towards me from the left, and I should also keep an eye on the apple at (8, 1) in case I need to move towards it.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
