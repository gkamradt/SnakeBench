The board state around me appears safe for the current move with no immediate threats from other snakes or my own body. \n\n**Immediate Objective**: To continue growing and increase my score, my primary aim should be targeting the next nearest apple. Closest options available are at (5, 2), (2, 4) and at (9, 7). \n\n**Path Analysis**: \n- Apple at (5, 2) is straight down, but would require moving DOWN multiple times. It seems like a direct and relatively unobstructed path, making it a good immediate target.\n- Apple at (2, 4) is further away and to the left, which could be slightly riskier due to longer travel and proximity to walls.\n- Apple at (9, 7) is much farther to the right; navigating there could involve more complex maneuvering around the board center.\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration**: \n- Given the enemy snake (#2) at position (4, 2) with their body at [(3, 2)], pursuing the apple at (5, 2) could take me closer to them. However, with a thoughtful approach, I can collect the apple while avoiding any direct confrontation.\n\n**Future Strategy**:\n- After targeting and potentially securing the apple at (5, 2), it would be strategic to reevaluate the board position for the next nearest apple and monitor enemy snake movements, staying adaptable to changes.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: DOWN\n\nPost this move, my next focus should be on potentially moving LEFT or RIGHT as needed to avoid enemy interaction and position myself favorably towards the next apple targets."

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "Current situation:\nAfter successfully moving RIGHT as planned, our snake has reached the apple at (5, 2) and grown in size. We are now positioned at (5, 2), and the nearest apple is located at (2, 4).\n\nThe enemy snake remains at (7, 6) with its body at (7, 5), still not posing an immediate threat. However, we must continue to monitor its movements and plan our strategy accordingly.\n\nStrategy:\nOur next objective is to reach the apple at (2, 4). To do this, we should move UP twice to reach (5, 4) and then move LEFT three times to arrive at (2, 4). This path allows us to avoid the walls and the enemy snake while collecting the apple.\n\nAfter consuming the apple at (2, 4), we should assess the positions of the remaining apples and the enemy snake to determine our next move. It's essential to maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake and the walls while navigating the board.\n\nIf the enemy snake starts to approach our area, we may need to adjust our strategy to avoid confrontation. We should prioritize our safety while still attempting to collect apples and increase our score.\n\nReminder for next turn: After reaching the apple at (2, 4), evaluate the positions of the remaining apples and the enemy snake. Plan our path carefully, maintaining a balance between collecting points and staying safe. Consider moving RIGHT and UP towards the apple at (9, 7) if it remains uncollected and if the path is clear.\n\nNext move: UP"
