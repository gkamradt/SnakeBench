            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is currently at position (5,7), and there are apples at (5,5), (6,2), (9,7), (0,6), and (6,5). Enemy snake number 2 is at (1,2) with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, lower Y values are towards the bottom, and higher Y values are upwards. X increases to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots (empty)\n\n- Row 8: all dots\n\n- Row 7: dots except at (5,7) where my snake is and (6,7) which is empty, and (9,7) has an apple.\n\n- Row 6: apple at (0,6), rest dots\n\n- Row 5: dots except apples at (5,5) and (6,5)\n\n- Row 4: all dots\n\n- Row 3: all dots\n\n- Row 2: enemy snake at (1,2), apple at (6,2)\n\n- Row 1: all dots\n\n- Row 0: all dots\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,7), and there are apples at (5,5), (6,2), (9,7), (0,6), and (6,5).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings of my snake head at (5,7).\n\n- Up: (5,8) is empty\n\n- Down: (5,6) is empty\n\n- Left: (4,7) is empty\n\n- Right: (6,7) is empty\n\nSo, all directions are currently open except for where there are walls or other snakes.\n\nBut I need to think ahead, not just look at immediate moves. I should consider which apple to go for first and plan a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples without dying.\n\nLet's look at the distances to each apple from my current position:\n\n- (5,5): 2 steps down\n\n- (6,2): 3 steps right and 5 steps down\n\n- (9,7): 4 steps right\n\n- (0,6): 5 steps left and 1 step down\n\n- (6,5): 1 step right and 2 steps down\n\nSo, the closest apple is (5,5), only 2 steps down.\n\nBut I should also consider if going for that apple might lead me into danger or block paths to other apples.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (1,2). It's relatively far away, but I should keep an eye on its possible movements.\n\nLet me think about the board again.\n\nIf I go down to (5,6), which is empty, and then to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,5), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move after that doesn't cause me to run into myself or other snakes.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could consider moving to another apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (5,5), I could potentially go to (6,5), which is adjacent.\n\nFrom (6,5), I could go to (6,2), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (9,7), but that would require moving right through potentially dangerous areas.\n\nWait, I need to think about the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (1,2). If I move towards (6,2), I might be crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize apples that are farther away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to eat the apple at (9,7), which is near the edge of the board.\n\nBut moving right to (9,7) would require passing through (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), and (9,7).\n\nI need to make sure that during this path, I don't run into the enemy or create a loop that traps me.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (1,2), which is quite far from my path to (9,7).\n\nUnless the enemy starts moving towards me, which I don't know yet because I don't have information about its direction.\n\nIn this turn, I only have its current position, not its direction.\n\nSo, perhaps it's safer to go for (9,7) first, as it's away from the enemy.\n\nBut (5,5) is closer. Maybe I should eat the closer apple first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (0,6), but that's quite far to the left and down.\n\nThat might not be the best option right now.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider which apple is least accessible and try to get it before the enemy does.\n\nWait, but I don't know the enemy's strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to eat as many apples as possible in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet me try to plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in a row.\n\nStarting at (5,7):\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Down to (5,5) to eat the apple\n\n- Right to (6,5) to eat another apple\n\n- Then, maybe down to (6,2), but that's a bit far and might be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Right to (6,7)\n\n- Right to (7,7)\n\n- Right to (8,7)\n\n- Right to (9,7) to eat the apple\n\nThen, perhaps down to (9,6), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about the sequence that allows me to eat the most apples with the least risk.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I have to make sure that I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, in this game, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that the tail stays, and the head moves to the new position.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't cause the head to collide with the body.\n\nBut right now, my snake is just the head at (5,7), so no body parts yet.\n\nAfter eating the first apple, my snake will have a body part at (5,7), and the head at (5,6), for example, if I move down.\n\nThen, next move to (5,5) to eat the apple, the body part moves to (5,6), and the head to (5,5).\n\nI need to ensure that the next move doesn't cause the head to move back to (5,6), where the body is.\n\nSo, planning paths that don't require backtracking onto myself.\n\nAlso, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's possible movements.\n\nBut since I don't know its direction, I'll have to make assumptions.\n\nPerhaps assume that it's moving towards the nearest apple as well.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (1,2), the nearest apple is at (6,2), which is 5 steps to the right.\n\nAlternatively, it might go for (0,6), which is 2 steps left and 4 steps up.\n\nHard to say.\n\nBut perhaps it's safer for me to go for (9,7), assuming the enemy goes for (6,2).\n\nBut (9,7) is quite far, and I might take too many turns to get there, allowing the enemy to eat apples in the meantime.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for (6,5), which is closer and has two apples in that area.\n\nWait, (6,5) and (5,5) are adjacent.\n\nI could eat (5,5), then (6,5), then perhaps move to (6,2).\n\nBut again, that might put me in the path of the enemy.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (9,7), as it's far from the enemy and near the edge, so fewer ways for the enemy to reach it quickly.\n\nTo get to (9,7) from (5,7), I need to move right 4 steps.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- (5,7) -> (6,7) -> (7,7) -> (8,7) -> (9,7)\n\nAssuming all these positions are empty except for the apple at (9,7).\n\nAfter eating (9,7), my snake will have body parts at (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), and head at (9,7).\n\nThen, I can decide to move down to (9,6), but there might be no apple there.\n\nAlternatively, move left to (8,7), but that would be onto my own body.\n\nSo, planning the path carefully.\n\nPerhaps after eating (9,7), I should move down to (9,6), even if there's no apple, just to avoid blocking myself.\n\nBut that might not be the best strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (5,5) first, as it's closer.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Down to (5,6)\n\n- Down to (5,5) to eat the apple\n\nNow, my snake is at (5,5), with body at (5,6) and (5,7"

But there's an apple at (9,7), so that could work.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, between (5,6) and (9,6), there are positions (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), and (9,6). I need to make sure these are all empty.\n\nFrom the board state, it looks like these positions are empty, except for the apple at (9,7).\n\nSo, I could move right to (6,6), then (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), and then up to (9,7) to eat the apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but it's a longer path compared to going down to (5,5).\n\nI need to consider the time factor; the more moves I take to reach an apple, the more chances the enemy has to reach it first.\n\nOn the other hand, going for the closer apple might be safer and quicker.\n\nAlso, considering that after eating an apple, my snake grows, so I have to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nLet me think about the growth. Every time I eat an apple, my snake gets longer, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without running into my own tail.\n\nIf I go for (5,5), then (6,5), then (6,2), my snake would be growing, and I need to ensure that I don't create a loop that traps me.\n\nAlternatively, going for (9,7) might give me more space to maneuver since it's near the edge.\n\nBut it's also possible that the enemy is moving towards one of the other apples, so I need to anticipate its movements.\n\nWait, but I don't have information about the enemy's direction or speed, so it's hard to predict.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to prioritize apples based on proximity and safety.\n\nSo, first, go for the closest apple, which is (5,5), then proceed to adjacent apples like (6,5), and so on.\n\nLet me consider the path:\n\n1. Move down from (5,6) to (5,5) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then move right to (6,5) to eat that apple.\n\n3. Then maybe down to (6,2), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, after (6,5), I could consider moving to another nearby apple.\n\nWait, (6,5) is adjacent to (5,5), so after eating (6,5), I could look for the next apple.\n\nBut (6,2) is quite far down; moving there would require passing through (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), which might be risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (9,7) after eating (6,5), but that would require moving right to (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), then up to (9,7). That's a long path.\n\nHmm, maybe not the best idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating (0,6), but that's all the way to the left and down, which would require moving left to (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a long path, and I might encounter the enemy along the way.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (5,5) and then (6,5) is the best short-term plan.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide the next move based on the enemy's position and the remaining apples.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't box myself in.\n\nFor example, if I eat (5,5) and (6,5), and then move to (6,4), but if my body is blocking the path, I might get trapped.\n\nSo, I need to plan my path carefully to avoid such scenarios.\n\nPerhaps, after eating (5,5) and (6,5), I should consider moving up to (6,6), then right or left accordingly.\n\nBut looking back at the board, (6,6) is currently empty, so that could be a possible move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider eating (9,7) first.\n\nLet me think about the path again:\n\n- From (5,6), move right to (6,6)\n\n- Then right to (7,6)\n\n- Then right to (8,6)\n\n- Then right to (9,6)\n\n- Then up to (9,7) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a total of 5 moves to get to (9,7).\n\nIn the meantime, the enemy could be moving towards another apple.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to go for the closer apple at (5,5) to secure points faster.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is at (0,2), which is far from (5,5), it's less likely to interfere with my path.\n\nSo, maybe the best first move is to go down to (5,5) to eat that apple.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (0,6), which is closer to the enemy's position.\n\nMaybe the enemy is aiming for that apple, but I don't know for sure.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should go for (5,5), eat it, then (6,5), and assess from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to block the enemy's path by positioning my snake in a way that hinders the enemy's movement.\n\nBut that might be too speculative at this stage.\n\nI think my priority should be to maximize my own points by eating as many apples as possible, while avoiding self-destruction and the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going for the closest apple seems like the most straightforward strategy.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be down to (5,5).\n\nBut wait, is (5,5) directly down from (5,6)? Yes, decreasing y-coordinate is down.\n\nSo, moving down from (5,6) to (5,5).\n\nAfter eating (5,5), my snake will be at (5,5), with my previous position (5,6) now part of my body.\n\nThen, I can move right to (6,5) to eat that apple.\n\nAfter that, I can decide whether to go for (6,2) or another apple.\n\nBut I need to be cautious not to extend my snake in a way that blocks my own path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating (9,7) after (6,5).\n\nLet me think about the path:\n\n- From (6,5), move right to (7,5)\n\n- Then right to (8,5)\n\n- Then right to (9,5)\n\n- Then up to (9,6)\n\n- Then up to (9,7) to eat the apple.\n\nThat's a possible path, but it's a bit long, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a shorter path or consider eating another apple in between.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the immediate move and worry about the rest later.\n\nGiven that, I think the best move"
