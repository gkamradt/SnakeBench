Let's evaluate my immediate movement options:\n\n- **UP:** Moving up to (6, 6).\n  - **Safety:** The position (6, 6) is within the board limits and appears to be free of obstacles.\n  - **Proximity to Apples:** No immediate apples are in this direction.\n\n- **DOWN:** Moving down to (6, 4).\n  - **Safety:** The position (6, 4) is within the board and contains an apple (`A`).\n  - **Proximity to Apples:** This move allows me to collect the apple at (6, 4) immediately, granting me an extra point and causing my snake to grow longer.\n\n- **LEFT:** Moving left to (5, 5).\n  - **Safety:** The position (5, 5) is within the board and contains an apple (`A`).\n  - **Proximity to Apples:** Moving left here allows me to collect the apple at (5, 5) immediately, granting me an extra point and causing my snake to grow longer.\n\n- **RIGHT:** Moving right to (7, 5).\n  - **Safety:** The position (7, 5) is currently occupied by my own tail (`T`). However, since my tail will move forward in the next turn (assuming I don't collect an apple), moving right is technically safe but doesn't provide any immediate benefits.\n  - **Proximity to Apples:** This direction moves me away from all available apples, which is not strategic for scoring.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n- **Apple Collection:** Both moving **DOWN** to (6, 4) and **LEFT** to (5, 5) allow me to collect an apple immediately. Collecting an apple not only increases my score but also causes my snake to grow, enhancing my ability to control space on the board.\n\n- **Future Mobility:** \n  - If I move **DOWN** to (6, 4), my subsequent move could be towards (6, 3) or adjust horizontally to position myself for other apples.\n  - If I move **LEFT** to (5, 5), I position myself closer to the apple at (6, 4) for the next move, maintaining a strategic advantage.\n\n- **Avoiding Collisions:** Both **DOWN** and **LEFT** moves are safe and avoid potential collisions with walls, enemy snakes, or my own body.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **LEFT**"

Enemy Snake Analysis:\n- Snake #2 is at (5, 5), moving in line with the (6, 5) body segment and doesn't block the pathway towards (6, 4).\n\n#### 4. Pathway Analysis and Risk Consideration:\n- **Safe Path Planning:** Continuing to move RIGHT is still valid, heading toward (6, 4).\n- This route does not involve adjacent confrontations with enemy snake segments or walls.\n\n#### 5. Minimize Collision Risk and Maximizing Opportunities:\n- By maintaining a course primarily along the x-axis towards the closest apple, risk remains minimized.\n  \n### Next Steps:\nGiven the analysis, continuing RIGHT towards the apple at (6, 4) is still optimal. This approach keeps the path unobstructed and allows enough space to adjust if Snake #2 strategically changes direction.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- **Monitor Enemy Positioning:** Observe any shift in Snake #2's path which could block or complicate access to subsequent apples or necessitate a turn to avoid collision.\n- **Prepare to Decisively Shift:** Be ready to pivot toward a different apple or direction in case a more strategic opportunity arises or a block occurs.\n\n### Final Decision:\nNext move: **RIGHT** to (4, 4)."

While the tail may move in the next turn, moving right does not provide any immediate benefits.\n  - **Proximity to Apples:** Moving right moves me away from available apples, which is not advantageous for scoring.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n- **Apple Collection:** Moving **DOWN** towards (5, 4) positions me closer to the apple at (6, 4). This sets up the opportunity to collect it in the subsequent move by moving right, thereby increasing my score and allowing my snake to grow longer.\n\n- **Safety:** Moving **DOWN** ensures I avoid collisions with my own body and maintain a safe distance from enemy snakes.\n\n- **Future Mobility:** By positioning closer to (6, 4), I maintain flexibility for future movements towards other apples while avoiding crowded areas.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **DOWN**\n\n--End of your next move information.--"
