If I move RIGHT, I\u2019ll arrive at (4,8), setting me up directly below the apple, which I can grab on the following move. Moving LEFT is unsafe because (2,8) is occupied by a snake segment, and while UP or DOWN would be safe, they don't put me as directly in line with the (4,9) apple. Also, enemy snake #2 (at (6,9) with body at (6,8)) isn\u2019t a threat along the path on the left side, so heading RIGHT is a good advancement toward an immediate point while keeping safe. \n\nNext move: RIGHT."

The enemy snake is still at (3, 8) with its body at [(2, 8), (2, 7)], but it's not an immediate threat.\n\nMy strategy for next turn is to move towards the apple at (1, 3). It's closer and might give me an opportunity to block the enemy snake's path or create a barrier between us.\n\nTo get to the apple at (1, 3), I need to move left and then down.
