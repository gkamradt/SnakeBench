There are apples at (6,4), (4,3), (6,9), (7,4), and (8,6). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board in my mind. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,4), which is near the bottom edge of the board. There's an apple at (6,4), which is directly to my left, three spaces away. Another apple is at (4,3), which is a bit diagonally up and left. There's one at (6,9), which is up and to the left as well. There's also an apple at (7,4), which is just one space to my left, and another at (8,6), which is up and to the right a bit.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apple at (7,4) is the closest, just one space to my left. But I should consider if going for that one first might put me in a position where I can easily reach another apple afterward.\n\nWait, and there's another snake, snake #1, at position (1,6), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head. That's on the upper left part of the board.\n\nI need to plan my path carefully to avoid colliding with snake #1 or its body, if it starts moving.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves.\n\nIf I go left to eat the apple at (7,4), my new position would be (8,4). Then, from there, I could potentially go up to (8,5), then (8,6) to eat the apple there, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim directly for the apple at (6,4), but that's further away, and there's an apple in between at (7,4).\n\nWait, no, (7,4) is to the left of me, and (6,4) is further left. So, to get to (6,4), I'd have to pass by (7,4).\n\nHmm, maybe I should just go for (6,4) directly, eating both apples in one path.\n\nLet me see. From (9,4), moving left to (8,4), then (7,4) to eat the apple there, then continue left to (6,4) to eat that one.\n\nBut I need to make sure that snake #1 isn't moving into my path.\n\nLooking at snake #1's position at (1,6), it's quite far from me, and since it doesn't have any body parts, it's probably just starting out.\n\nI should assume it might move towards one of the apples as well, but for now, its position isn't immediately threatening.\n\nSo, focusing on my path: (9,4) -> (8,4) -> (7,4) -> (6,4).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I would grow, so my tail would extend. I need to make sure that I don't create a situation where my tail moves into a position that blocks my path.\n\nWait, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, meaning that the last segment stays, and you essentially extend.\n\nBut in this game, I think it's similar: when you eat an apple, you grow, but I'm not exactly sure about the mechanics of growth.\n\nAssuming that after eating an apple, my snake gets longer by one segment, I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nSo, if I move from (9,4) to (8,4), then to (7,4), and then to (6,4), eating the apple there, I would grow, so my tail would remain at (9,4).\n\nThen, next move, if I continue left towards (5,4), I need to make sure that I'm not going to hit my tail, which is at (9,4), but since I'm moving left, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nWait, no, my tail is at (9,4), and I'm moving left from (6,4) to (5,4), which is further left, so no collision there.\n\nBut I need to plan several moves ahead to ensure that my growing tail doesn't block my path.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (6,9), which is up and to the left. That would involve moving up from (9,4) to (9,5), then (9,6), and so on, up to (9,9), then left to (8,9), (7,9), etc., down to (6,9).\n\nBut that seems like a longer path, and I might encounter snake #1 on the way up.\n\nMoreover, I would be leaving the apples at (7,4) and (6,4) untouched for now, which might allow snake #1 to go for them.\n\nI need to consider not only my path but also anticipate possible moves from snake #1.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,3), which is diagonally up and left.\n\nFrom (9,4), I could move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), up to (8,6) to eat the apple there, then continue left and down to reach other apples.\n\nBut this seems convoluted, and I might end up confusing myself.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to prioritize the closest apples first, to maximize the number of apples I can eat in a shorter distance.\n\nThe apple at (7,4) is right next to me, only one space to the left.\n\nIf I eat that, I gain a point and grow, then I can continue left to (6,4), eat that apple, grow again, and perhaps continue to other apples.\n\nLet me consider that path:\n\n1. Move left from (9,4) to (8,4).\n\n2. Move left from (8,4) to (7,4), eating the apple there.\n\n3. Grow, so my tail is now at (9,4).\n\n4. Move left from (7,4) to (6,4), eating another apple.\n\n5. Grow again, so my tail is now at (8,4).\n\n6. Continue from there to other apples.\n\nThis seems feasible. Now, I need to make sure that snake #1 isn't going to block my path.\n\nSnake #1 is at (1,6), and if it moves down or to the right, it might intersect with my path, but given the distances, it's unlikely in the short term.\n\nMoreover, snake #1 might be going for different apples, so perhaps we can coexist for a few moves.\n\nTherefore, I think the best immediate move is to go left to (8,4), preparing to eat the apple at (7,4) next move.\n\nBut wait, the apple is at (7,4), so moving left from (9,4) to (8,4) puts me closer, but I need to be careful not to get boxed in or to create a situation where my tail blocks my path.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go directly for the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving up or down to position myself better for multiple apple consumption.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (6,4), (4,3), (6,9), (7,4), and (8,6).\n\nIf I move up from (9,4) to (9,5), then to (9,6), I could potentially go to (8,6) to eat the apple there, then maybe left or right from there.\n\nBut that seems less efficient than going for the closer apples to the left.\n\nWait, perhaps a balanced approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths:\n\nPath 1:\n\n- Left to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (7,4), eat apple\n\n- Left to (6,4), eat apple\n\n- Up to (6,5), then (6,6), etc., towards (6,9)\n\nPath 2:\n\n- Up to (9,5)\n\n- Up to (9,6)\n\n- Left to (8,6), eat apple\n\n- Left to (7,6), up to (7,7), etc., towards (6,9)\n\nPath 1 seems shorter in terms of moves to eat multiple apples.\n\nIn Path 1, I can eat two apples quickly, growing in size, but I need to ensure that my growing tail doesn't block my path.\n\nIn Path 2, I go up first, eat one apple, and then perhaps continue up and left.\n\nBut Path 1 allows me to eat two apples in quick succession, which could be beneficial.\n\nGiven that, I think Path 1 is better.\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to go left to (8,4), then next move to (7,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, continue left to (6,4) to eat another apple.\n\nAfter that, I can assess the board again and decide the next move.\n\nI should also keep an eye"

So, I need to plan a path to eat these apples efficiently.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), and the apples around me:\n\n- (7,4) is directly to my left.\n\n- (6,4) is two spaces to the left.\n\n- (8,6) is two spaces up.\n\n- (6,9) is up and to the left.\n\n- (4,3) is up and to the left, a bit diagonally.\n\nI also need to consider the position of the other snake, snake #1, which is at (1,6) with no body parts listed, so it's probably just starting out.\n\nMy last move was to the left, and I was thinking about eating the apple at (7,4), then continuing to (6,4), and so on.\n\nBut I need to think ahead more carefully. Let's consider the possible paths and potential risks.\n\nOption 1: Go left to (7,4), eat the apple, then continue left to (6,4), eat that apple, and then maybe go up to (6,5), (6,6), and so on towards (6,9).\n\nOption 2: Go up to (8,5), then (8,6) to eat the apple at (8,6), then maybe left to (7,6), up to (7,7), etc., towards (6,9).\n\nOption 3: Aim directly for the apple at (6,4), passing by (7,4), and then see from there.\n\nI need to consider which path allows me to eat the most apples with the least risk.\n\nOption 1 seems straightforward: eat two apples in quick succession by moving left to (7,4) and then to (6,4). This would give me points quickly and allow me to grow in size.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that my growing tail doesn't block my path. In snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, so I have to ensure that I have enough space to maneuver without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet's simulate this:\n\n1. Move left from (8,4) to (7,4), eating the apple there.\n\n2. Now, my tail is at (8,4).\n\n3. Next, move left from (7,4) to (6,4), eating another apple.\n\n4. My tail is now at (7,4).\n\n5. From (6,4), I can continue left to (5,4), but there are no apples there. So, maybe I should consider moving up or down from there.\n\nBut looking at the board, there are no apples directly above or below (6,4) that I can see from the given information. So, after eating the apples at (7,4) and (6,4), I might need to change direction.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (6,4), I could move up to (6,5), then to (6,6), and so on, towards (6,9). But that seems like a longer path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into snake #1 or any part of my own body.\n\nWait, snake #1 is at (1,6), which is quite far from my current position. It's unlikely to interfere with my immediate plans, but I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\nAnother consideration is that if I go left to (7,4), then to (6,4), I'm moving further away from snake #1, which might be a good thing, depending on its direction.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (8,6) first, which is directly above me. That way, I stay in the same X column and can potentially eat more apples in the same vertical path.\n\nLet's think about that:\n\n1. Move up from (8,4) to (8,5).\n\n2. Then to (8,6) to eat the apple at (8,6).\n\n3. From there, I can move left or right, depending on the next apples.\n\nBut looking at the board, there are no apples immediately adjacent after (8,6), so I might have to decide which direction to go next.\n\nComparing the two options:\n\n- Option 1: Go left to (7,4), eat apple, then to (6,4), eat another apple. From there, perhaps move up towards (6,9).\n\n- Option 2: Go up to (8,6), eat apple, then decide the next move.\n\nOption 1 allows me to eat two apples in quick succession, which could be beneficial for points and growth. Option 2 only eats one apple immediately.\n\nMoreover, moving left towards the cluster of apples at (6,4), (7,4), and potentially towards (6,9) might be more efficient in terms of apple density.\n\nLooking at the board, the area around (6,4) and (6,9) has multiple apples, so investing in moving left might pay off in the long run.\n\nAlso, moving left puts some distance between me and snake #1, which is at (1,6).\n\nTherefore, I think the best initial move is to go left to (7,4), eat the apple there, then continue left to (6,4) to eat another one, and from there, assess the situation.\n\nBut before I make that move, I need to ensure that moving left from (8,4) to (7,4) is safe.\n\nLooking back at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: 1 . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . A A 2 .\n\nRow 3: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, at row 4, column 7 is an apple, column 6 is another apple, and column 8 is snake 2 (me).\n\nWait, in the board state, row 4 has positions: . . . . . . A A 2 .\n\nSo, column 7 and 6 have apples, and column 8 has snake 2.\n\nBut according to the apple positions given earlier: (6,4), (4,3), (6,9), (7,4), (8,6).\n\nWait, there seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nIn the board state, row 4 (which is Y=4) has apples at columns 7 and 6 (X=7 and X=6), which matches the apples at (7,4) and (6,4).\n\nSnake 2 is at (8,4), which is column 8, row 4.\n\nSo, the board state seems consistent with the apple positions.\n\nTherefore, moving left from (8,4) to (7,4) is directly to the apple at (7,4).\n\nFrom there, moving left to (6,4) to eat another apple.\n\nAfter that, perhaps moving up to (6,5), then (6,6), and so on towards (6,9).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't run into snake #1 or its body.\n\nSnake #1 is at (1,6), which is row 6, column 1.\n\nFrom my position at (8,4), moving left to (7,4), then to (6,4), then up to (6,5), (6,6), etc., it's unlikely to cross paths with snake #1 in the short term.\n\nTherefore, I think the safest and most rewarding immediate move is to go left to (7,4) and eat the apple there.\n\nNext move, I can continue left to (6,4) to eat another apple.\n\nAfter that, I'll need to decide whether to go up towards (6,9) or consider other apples.\n\nBut for now, focusing on the closest apples seems like a good strategy.\n\nI should also keep an eye on snake #1's movements and adjust my path accordingly if needed.\n\nIn summary, my strategy for the next few moves is:\n\n1. Move left to (7,4), eating the apple there.\n\n2. Move left to (6,4), eating another apple.\n\n3. Then, depending on the situation, move up towards (6,9) or consider other apples.\n\nThis approach allows me to quickly gain points and grow in size, while avoiding immediate risks from other snakes.\n\n**Final Move Decision: LEFT**"
