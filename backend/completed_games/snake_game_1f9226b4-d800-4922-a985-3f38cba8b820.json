          "1": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (5,9). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). Apples are at (1,7), (8,0), (8,4), (1,9), (1,1). My snake is at (5,9), which is the top middle area. The enemy snake #2 is at (2,7) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment right now.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. From (5,9), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but moving UP from (5,9) would take me to (5,10), which is outside the board (since max Y is 9). So UP is invalid. So possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current position is (5,9). Let me confirm the directions. Increasing Y is up, but since (5,9) is already the top row (Y=9), moving up would go out of bounds. So UP is not possible. So possible moves are DOWN (to Y=8), LEFT (to X=4), or RIGHT (to X=6).\n\nNow, check each direction for safety and apples.\n\nLEFT to (4,9): Is there an apple there? The apples are at (1,7), (8,0), (8,4), (1,9), (1,1). (4,9) isn't listed, so no apple. But is that position safe? The board state shows that at row 9 (the top row), the snake is at (5,9). The enemy snake #2 is at (2,7). So moving left to (4,9) would be an empty spot. So that's safe. But no apple, so no growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,8): Let's check the board. The row 8 (Y=8) has nothing according to the board state. So (5,8) is empty. No apple here either. So moving down is safe but no points.\n\nRIGHT to (6,9): That's moving right. Check if there's anything there. The board's top row (Y=9) has the snake at (5,9), then next is (6,9) which is empty. No apple there. So moving right is safe but no gain.\n\nSo all three possible moves are safe but don't get apples. But maybe I should look for the nearest apple. Let's check the apple positions. The closest apples to (5,9) are (1,9) and (8,4), (1,7). Let's see:\n\n(1,9) is at X=1, Y=9. That's on the same row as me (Y=9), but to the left. So from (5,9), moving left four times would get there. But each move left would decrease X by 1. But moving left once would take me to (4,9), then (3,9), etc. But that's a long path, and I need to avoid walls and other snakes. However, snake #2 is at (2,7), which is not on that path. But moving left towards (1,9) might be a good idea to get that apple. However, the first step is to move left. But in the current position, moving left once would take me to (4,9), which is safe. Then next moves would need to continue left. But since the snake's body is only one segment (since it's just the head), moving left each time would work as long as there's no obstacles. But the enemy snake is at (2,7), which is not in the way. So maybe heading towards (1,9) is a good plan. But that's four moves left. Alternatively, maybe there's a better apple to target.\n\nAnother apple is at (1,7). That's two rows down from (5,9). So from (5,9), moving down to (5,8), then left to (4,8), then left to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe moving down first and then left. But the immediate move is just the first step. So perhaps moving left towards (1,9) is better for the apple there.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is at the bottom right. From (5,9), moving down and right. But that's a longer path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is far away. (8,0) is also far. So the closest apples are (1,9) and (1,7). Let's calculate the Manhattan distance. (1,9) is 4 units left (from X=5 to X=1). (1,7) is 4 left and 2 down. So (1,9) is closer in terms of steps. So maybe heading towards (1,9) is better.\n\nBut the first move is to go left. So if I move left now, I can start moving towards that apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. Since the enemy snake is at (2,7), which is not on the same row. So moving left along Y=9 should be safe. But I need to check if there are any other snakes. The board state shows that in row 9, there's the snake at (5,9) (me), and the rest are dots except for (1,9) which is an apple. So moving left towards (1,9) seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,8) might open up more options. From there, I can go left towards (1,7) or other apples. But that's a different path.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (2,7). If I move towards (1,7), which is an apple, I might cross paths with the enemy. But since the enemy is at (2,7), moving to (1,7) would require moving left from (2,7), but the enemy's next move could be towards that apple as well. So maybe competition for that apple. But since the enemy's body is empty, they can move freely. But perhaps it's better to go for the apple that's less contested.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (1,9) is safer because it's on the same row and the enemy is not near there. So moving left towards (1,9) might be better.\n\nSo the first move: LEFT to (4,9). Then next moves would continue left. But I need to make sure that each step is safe. Since the snake is only the head, moving left each time would not collide with itself. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,9) would take me away from the apples. Not useful unless there's an apple in that direction, but there isn't. So moving right is not helpful.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,8) would take me to a position where I can then go left or right. But again, no immediate apple. So perhaps moving left is better to start heading towards the apple at (1,9).\n\nSo the best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apple at (1,9), which is the closest. The next move would be LEFT again, and so on until I reach the apple. Each step left is safe as long as there's no obstacles. Since the enemy is at (2,7), which is not on the same row, and the path to (1,9) is clear, this seems safe.\n\nWait, but the board state shows that at (1,9) there's an apple. So moving left four times would get me there. Each step left is safe. So first move: LEFT. Then next moves continue left. So the first step is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (1,9) by moving left each step. Avoid potential conflicts with enemy snake #2 near (2,7) by staying on the top row. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (5,9). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). Apples are at (1,7), (8,0), (8,4), (1,9), (1,1). My snake is at (5,9), which is the top middle area. The enemy snake #2 is at (2,7) with an empty body, so it's just a single segment right now.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. From (5,9), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, but moving UP from (5,9) would take me to (5,10), which is outside the board (since max Y is 9). So UP is invalid. So possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the current position is (5,9). Let me confirm the directions. Increasing Y is up, but since (5,9) is already the top row (Y=9), moving up would go out of bounds. So UP is not possible. So possible moves are DOWN (to Y=8), LEFT (to X=4), or RIGHT (to X=6).\n\nNow, check each direction for safety and apples.\n\nLEFT to (4,9): Is there an apple there? The apples are at (1,7), (8,0), (8,4), (1,9), (1,1). (4,9) isn't listed, so no apple. But is that position safe? The board state shows that at row 9 (the top row), the snake is at (5,9). The enemy snake #2 is at (2,7). So moving left to (4,9) would be an empty spot. So that's safe. But no apple, so no growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,8): Let's check the board. The row 8 (Y=8) has nothing according to the board state. So (5,8) is empty. No apple here either. So moving down is safe but no points.\n\nRIGHT to (6,9): That's moving right. Check if there's anything there. The board's top row (Y=9) has the snake at (5,9), then next is (6,9) which is empty. No apple there. So moving right is safe but no gain.\n\nSo all three possible moves are safe but don't get apples. But maybe I should look for the nearest apple. Let's check the apple positions. The closest apples to (5,9) are (1,9) and (8,4), (1,7). Let's see:\n\n(1,9) is at X=1, Y=9. That's on the same row as me (Y=9), but to the left. So from (5,9), moving left four times would get there. But each move left would decrease X by 1. But moving left once would take me to (4,9), then (3,9), etc. But that's a long path, and I need to avoid walls and other snakes. However, snake #2 is at (2,7), which is not on that path. But moving left towards (1,9) might be a good idea to get that apple. However, the first step is to move left. But in the current position, moving left once would take me to (4,9), which is safe. Then next moves would need to continue left. But since the snake's body is only one segment (since it's just the head), moving left each time would work as long as there's no obstacles. But the enemy snake is at (2,7), which is not in the way. So maybe heading towards (1,9) is a good plan. But that's four moves left. Alternatively, maybe there's a better apple to target.\n\nAnother apple is at (1,7). That's two rows down from (5,9). So from (5,9), moving down to (5,8), then left to (4,8), then left to (3,8), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe moving down first and then left. But the immediate move is just the first step. So perhaps moving left towards (1,9) is better for the apple there.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) is at the bottom right. From (5,9), moving down and right. But that's a longer path. Maybe not the best first move.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is far away. (8,0) is also far. So the closest apples are (1,9) and (1,7). Let's calculate the Manhattan distance. (1,9) is 4 units left (from X=5 to X=1). (1,7) is 4 left and 2 down. So (1,9) is closer in terms of steps. So maybe heading towards (1,9) is better.\n\nBut the first move is to go left. So if I move left now, I can start moving towards that apple. But I need to make sure that the path is safe. Since the enemy snake is at (2,7), which is not on the same row. So moving left along Y=9 should be safe. But I need to check if there are any other snakes. The board state shows that in row 9, there's the snake at (5,9) (me), and the rest are dots except for (1,9) which is an apple. So moving left towards (1,9) seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,8) might open up more options. From there, I can go left towards (1,7) or other apples. But that's a different path.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (2,7). If I move towards (1,7), which is an apple, I might cross paths with the enemy. But since the enemy is at (2,7), moving to (1,7) would require moving left from (2,7), but the enemy's next move could be towards that apple as well. So maybe competition for that apple. But since the enemy's body is empty, they can move freely. But perhaps it's better to go for the apple that's less contested.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (1,9) is safer because it's on the same row and the enemy is not near there. So moving left towards (1,9) might be better.\n\nSo the first move: LEFT to (4,9). Then next moves would continue left. But I need to make sure that each step is safe. Since the snake is only the head, moving left each time would not collide with itself. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,9) would take me away from the apples. Not useful unless there's an apple in that direction, but there isn't. So moving right is not helpful.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,8) would take me to a position where I can then go left or right. But again, no immediate apple. So perhaps moving left is better to start heading towards the apple at (1,9).\n\nSo the best move is LEFT. That way, I start moving towards the apple at (1,9), which is the closest. The next move would be LEFT again, and so on until I reach the apple. Each step left is safe as long as there's no obstacles. Since the enemy is at (2,7), which is not on the same row, and the path to (1,9) is clear, this seems safe.\n\nWait, but the board state shows that at (1,9) there's an apple. So moving left four times would get me there. Each step left is safe. So first move: LEFT. Then next moves continue left. So the first step is LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (1,9) by moving left each step. Avoid potential conflicts with enemy snake #2 near (2,7) by staying on the top row. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The board state shows that row 9 has my snake at (4,9) and the apple at (1,9). There's no mention of other snakes or obstacles in that row. So moving LEFT to (3,9) should be safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,8) might open up a path towards other apples, but the closest apple is still (1,9). Moving RIGHT would take me back to (5,9), which I just left, and there's no benefit there. \n\nEnemy snake #2 is at (1,7) and (2,7). Since they are in row 7, they might be moving towards the apple at (1,7) or (5,3). However, their current position doesn't interfere with my path to (1,9). \n\nContinuing LEFT towards (1,9) seems the best option. Each step left reduces the distance to the apple.

Then next move I could go to (1,9) and eat the apple. \n\nBut wait, the enemy snake #2 is at (1,7) and (2,7). They are in row 7, so they might not be a direct threat right now.
