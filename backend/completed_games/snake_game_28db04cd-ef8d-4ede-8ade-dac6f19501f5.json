My snake is now at (8, 9) and has a length of 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the distances to the apples:\n- (2, 6): Distance is sqrt((8-2)^2 + (9-6)^2) = sqrt(36 + 9) = sqrt(45) = 6.7\n- (4, 0): Distance is sqrt((8-4)^2 + (9-0)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97) = 9.8\n- (4, 3): Distance is sqrt((8-4)^2 + (9-3)^2) = sqrt(16 + 36) = sqrt(52) = 7.2\n- (7, 2): Distance is sqrt((8-7)^2 + (9-2)^2) = sqrt(1 + 49) = sqrt(50) = 7.1\n- (0, 9): Distance is sqrt((8-0)^2 + (9-9)^2) = sqrt(64 + 0) = sqrt(64) = 8\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 6).
