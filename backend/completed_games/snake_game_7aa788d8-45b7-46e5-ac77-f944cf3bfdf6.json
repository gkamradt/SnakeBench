Moving up to (1, 8) and then to (1, 9) will allow the snake to reach this apple easily.\n- **Apple at (4, 2)**: This is the closest apple, but it requires more moves and careful navigation to avoid the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Move Towards the Closest Apple Above**: Since the apple at (9, 7) is directly above the snake, moving up to (1, 8) and then to (1, 9) will be the most efficient way to gain points.\n- **Avoid the Enemy Snake**: The enemy snake is far away and not an immediate threat. However, we should keep an eye on its movements to avoid any potential collisions in the future.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Move UP**: Moving up to (1, 8) will bring us closer to the apple at (9, 7) and avoid any immediate threats.\n\n### Strategy for next turn:\n- Continue moving up towards the apple at (9, 7). Once we reach (1, 9), we can move right to (2, 9) and continue moving right until we reach the apple.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

This keeps my options open for the next turns and positions me slightly closer to my objective.\n\nNext move: **UP**."
