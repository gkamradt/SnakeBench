The enemy snake is at (9, 4), which is relatively far from the snake's current position. The snake should aim to move towards the apple at (6, 5) while ensuring it doesn't get cornered or blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nMoving UP to (6, 2) would be a good move to start heading towards the apple at (6, 5). This move also keeps the snake safe from the enemy and ensures it doesn't get cornered.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving UP, I will continue to move towards the apple at (6, 5) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements and ensuring I don't get cornered.\n\nNext move: UP"
