The remaining apples are located at **(7, 0)**, **(1, 8)**, **(3, 3)**, and **(4, 0)**. My primary objective is to maximize points by efficiently collecting these apples while avoiding collisions with walls and the enemy snake.\n\n**Possible Moves from (8, 2):**\n\n1. **RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n   - **Pros:** Moves me closer to the right boundary, which might provide space to maneuver in subsequent turns.\n   - **Cons:** There are no nearby apples in this direction, making it inefficient for scoring. Additionally, being close to the wall could limit future movement options.\n\n2. **LEFT to (7, 2):**\n   - **Pros:** Positions me directly adjacent to the **(7, 0)** apple, facilitating a quicker path to collect it in subsequent moves.\n   - **Cons:** Requires careful navigation to avoid getting trapped near the bottom-left corner, especially after collecting the apple.\n\n3. **UP to (8, 3):**\n   - **Pros:** Increases distance from the enemy snake at **(3, 5)**, reducing the risk of potential collisions.\n   - **Cons:** Moves me away from all remaining apples, making it a less optimal choice for scoring.\n\n4. **DOWN to (8, 1):**\n   - **Pros:** Brings me one step closer to the **(7, 0)** and **(4, 0)** apples.\n   - **Cons:** Moves me closer to the lower boundary, which might restrict movement options, especially if I need to navigate around the **(7, 0)** apple.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- **Proximity to Apples:** The **(7, 0)** apple is the closest, requiring only a move or two to collect.\n- **Safety:** Moving **LEFT** maintains a safer distance from walls compared to moving **DOWN**, which brings me closer to the lower boundary.\n- **Strategic Positioning:** Positioning towards the **(7, 0)** apple first allows for a straightforward path to the **(4, 0)** apple afterward, maximizing point accumulation.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving **LEFT** to **(7, 2)**, my plan is to move **DOWN** to **(7, 1)**, positioning myself for the imminent collection of the **(7, 0)** apple. This approach ensures efficient scoring while maintaining ample space to navigate and avoid potential collisions.\n\n**Next move:** **LEFT**"

However, I need to be mindful of the enemy snake's position at (7, 1) with no body segments yet.\n\nIf I move UP, the enemy snake could potentially move towards me and try to cut off my path or trap me. So, I should keep an eye on their movements and be prepared to adjust my strategy if needed.\n\nAnother option could be to move LEFT or RIGHT to create some distance from the enemy snake, but that would take me further away from the apple at (3, 3), which is not ideal.\n\nOverall, I think the best move for now is to continue moving UP towards the apple at (3, 3), while staying vigilant and ready to change course if the enemy snake poses a direct threat.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Assess the enemy snake's movement and adjust my path accordingly, prioritizing the closest apple while avoiding traps or collisions.\n\nNext move: UP"
