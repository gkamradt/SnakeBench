The closest apple to me is at (5, 3), but the path there is open and there's a risk of running into Snake 2. The apple at (1, 9) is far away but in a safer position.\n\nIf I move upwards, I might collide with Snake #2 in a race for the apple at (5,8).\n\nAs per the situation, the best move for me would be to go right, then upward towards the apples at (1,9) and (5,8). Moving right doesn't pose any immediate threats as I can gauge the situation and maneuver accordingly. So, for this turn, I should move RIGHT.\n\nNext Move: RIGHT."

Snake 2 is still located at (4, 8) and with empty body, it doesn't seem to crowd the board at this moment. The nearest apple still stands at (5, 3) but getting this apple can most likely make me collide with snake 2 as it seems it is also heading to eat that apple.\n\nApples at (5, 2) and (6, 2) are also quite near but going directly to them can be risky as tiles below are available for snake #2 to make a sudden movement. Instead, I should advance towards the top right direction, towards the apples at (5, 8) and (1, 9), while keeping an eye on any unpredicted movement from Snake #2. If conditions allow, I might want to revisit the bottom apples.\n\nFor this turn, a safe move should be to go UP.\n\nNext Move: UP."
