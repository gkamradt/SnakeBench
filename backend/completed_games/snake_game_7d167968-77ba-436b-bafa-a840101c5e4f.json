            "rationale": "Given the current board state, my snake is at (8, 9). The nearest apple is at (6, 8), which is to the left and slightly below my current position. However, moving left would not be the best move because it would not help me progress towards the more distant apples and might limit my future movement options.\n\nThe best strategy is to move up towards the apple at (3, 8), which is directly above my current position. This move will also keep me away from the enemy snake, which is positioned at (1, 4) with its body at [(1, 3), (1, 2)].\n\nStrategy for the next few moves:\n- Move up to (9, 9) and continue moving up towards the apple at (3, 8).\n- Once the apple at (3, 8) is eaten, consider the next closest apple, which is at (1, 5).\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions.\n- Keep an eye on the other apples to maximize points.\n\nNext move: UP"
