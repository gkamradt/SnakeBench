That will make me grow by 1 and give me a point.\n\nSo my thought process is:\n1) Prioritize safe moves to nearby apples \n2) Avoid the other snake early on\n3) Grow longer first, then get more aggressive\n\nNext turn I'll tell myself: Once you've eaten the close apple, assess whether to chase the farther one at (9,2) or go for the cluster of apples at (6,8) and (5,8). Keep an eye on what the other snake does.\n\nMove: DOWN"

If Snake #1 moves UP in the next turn, I may need to adjust my strategy and prioritize the (6, 8) or (9, 8) apples instead.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP to (5, 7), evaluate Snake #1's position once more. If they haven't moved upwards, proceed with the plan to move RIGHT and collect the (5, 8) apple. If Snake #1 has moved UP, consider changing course to target the (6, 8) or (9, 8) apples, depending on their position and the safety of the path.\n\nUP"

If it attempts to block paths or collect apples en masse, be prepared to shift strategy towards available apples on less contested sections of the board.\n  - Keep an adaptive mindset to loop around towards other apples, such as (4, 7), if further threats arise from Snake #2's advancing position.\n\n- **Expansion and Adaptability**:\n  - Always keep a path open, allowing the snake to expand without cornering itself.\n  - Maximize the potential to loop back onto unexplored sections of the board, facilitating long-term apple collection and survival.\n\n**Decided Move**: DOWN"

If Snake #1 starts moving up, you can easily adjust your path to go for the (9, 8) apple instead.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT, keep an eye on Snake #1's movements. If they continue to focus on the bottom right, consider moving UP to (3, 7) and then RIGHT to (4, 7) to set yourself up for the (5, 8) apple.

This will let me avoid potential collisions with Snake #1 while still collecting points.\n\nMy new strategy:\n- Move UP this turn to (3, 4)\n- Continue moving UP for the next several turns, aiming for the apple at (5, 8)\n- After getting the (5, 8) apple, reevaluate based on Snake #1's position\n- If they're still near the right edge, go for the (6, 8) and (9, 8) apples next\n- If the path is clear, consider going for the (8, 2) and (9, 2) apples instead\n- Always watch Snake #1 and be ready to adjust if they get too close\n\nNext turn I'll tell myself: Great adjusting to Snake #1's move! Now you're at (3, 4) and have a clear path UP to that juicy apple cluster. Just watch Snake #1 and be ready to react if needed. Keep going UP and you'll be chomping on that (5, 8) apple in no time!

I've grown and I'm looking for the next optimal move to continue collecting apples and maintaining position advantage.\n\n- **Apple Location and Priority**:\n  - The closest potential apple target is at (5, 8).\n  - There are also apples at (3, 1), (0, 1), (8, 0), and (4, 7).\n\n- **Threat Evaluation**:\n  - The enemy snake, Snake #2, is currently at (5, 8) with its body extending to (6, 8) and (6, 7). This indicates that a LEFT move might not be possible without risking collision, depending on Snake #2's next move.\n  - It's important to avoid Snake #2, especially its head and growing sections, while continuing to prioritize high-score maneuvers.\n\n- **Strategic Path Forward**:\n  - Since the immediate left lane is occupied by Snake #2's body, moving down vertically towards another apple might be a safer option. The apple at (8, 0) could be a potential target, and moving towards it would avoid a direct encounter with the other snake.\n  - Additionally, I should consider whether Snake #2 might continue occupying the horizontal lane, or if it's planning any aggressive maneuvers towards available apples.\n\n- **Self-Collision Mitigation**:\n  - At this point, there\u2019s no self-collision issue since my body hasn\u2019t formed loops obstructing potential moves downwards or in any other direction.\n\n### Strategy Reevaluation\n\n- **Primary Move**:\n  - Given the current board state and potential threats, moving DOWN vertically from (8, 8) to (8, 7) seems optimal. This move allows me to circumvent Snake #2 while also moving towards one of the strategically valuable apples.\n\n- **Future Considerations**:\n  - Monitor Snake #2's actions closely, especially its pattern of movement. If it attempts to block paths or collect apples en masse, be prepared to shift strategy towards available apples on less contested sections of the board.\n  - Keep an adaptive mindset to loop around towards other apples, such as (4, 7), if further threats arise from Snake #2's advancing position.\n\n- **Expansion and Adaptability**:\n  - Always keep a path open, allowing the snake to expand without cornering itself.\n  - Maximize the potential to loop back onto unexplored sections of the board, facilitating long-term apple collection and survival.\n\n**Decided Move**: DOWN"
