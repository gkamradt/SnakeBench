However, we also need to ensure we're not falling into potential traps of Snake #1. The left and upward path would be the safest, and the header should be adjusted to move up as the snake's current position is now (1,0). Upward movement will shorten the distance towards our targeted apple and move away from Snake #1, reducing the potential risk of encountering it again.\n\nNext move: UP."
