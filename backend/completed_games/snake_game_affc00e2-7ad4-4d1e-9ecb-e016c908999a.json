This move could make a future collision with the enemy snake more likely. \n- If we opt to move UP, we could move towards the apple at (4,8) and then proceed to the one at (9,8).\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't go straight upwards in pursuit of its closest apple, the most optimal direction for future moves right now seems to be UP. It decreases the gap between two apples, and keeps us away from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: \nDepending on where the enemy snake moves, we could continue moving UP to collect the apple at (9,8).
