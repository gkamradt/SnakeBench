            "rationale": "Let's analyze the situation. I'm currently at position (6, 8) and my goal is to move towards the apple at (5, 8) while avoiding the enemy snake. The enemy snake is currently at position (5, 9) with its body at [(4, 9), (4, 8)].\n\nIf I move left, I'll be closer to the apple, but I'll also be closer to the enemy snake's body. However, since the enemy snake's head is at (5, 9), it's likely that it will move down or right to avoid the top edge of the board.\n\nConsidering this, I think it's safe to move left towards the apple. I'll keep an eye on the enemy snake's next move and adjust my strategy if needed.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If the enemy snake moves towards me, I'll consider moving down or right to avoid it. If I reach the apple at (5, 8), my next goal will be to move towards the apple at (4, 4) or (0, 8), depending on the enemy snake's position.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
