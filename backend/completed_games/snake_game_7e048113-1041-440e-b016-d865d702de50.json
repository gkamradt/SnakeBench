Now that I\u2019m at (5,9), I can approach the apple cluster while keeping my distance.\n\nLet\u2019s review the options from (5,9):\n\u2022 UP isn\u2019t an option because (5,10) would be off the board.\n\u2022 RIGHT to (6,9) would be safe, but it carries me further away from the upper\u2010left apple cluster.\n\u2022 DOWN to (5,8) might seem promising, but it would put me in line horizontally with the enemy snake at (4,8), and there\u2019s the possibility the enemy could shift RIGHT into (5,8) if it\u2019s trying to reposition.\n\u2022 LEFT to (4,9) brings me directly closer to the apple cluster. One possible risk is if the enemy snake from (4,8) were to move UP into (4,9) at the same time\u2014resulting in a head\u2010to\u2010head collision. However, given that there\u2019s a tasty apple at (3,8) just waiting to be snatched, it\u2019s more likely that enemy snake #2 will choose to move LEFT (or DOWN) toward that apple rather than UP, which would not help it grab any food.\n\nGiven that I want to work my way toward the cluster and the relative risk is lower if the enemy opts for its own apple grab, moving LEFT from (5,9) seems to be the best path. Later in the game I can adjust my strategy if the enemy\u2019s choice becomes clearer.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: LEFT."
