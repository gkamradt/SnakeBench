This will take us to position (6, 7). This move avoids any immediate danger and keeps our options open for the next turn.\n\nAfter moving to (6, 7), we will be in a good position to collect the apple at (4, 9) on the subsequent turn by moving left to (5, 7) and then up to (4, 7), and finally left again to (4, 6) to collect the apple. This path also allows us to keep an eye on Snake #2's movements and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\nNext move: LEFT to position (7, 7), starting the approach to the apple at (4, 9) while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #2.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving left to (7, 7), plan to move up to (6, 7) on the next turn, continuing the approach to the apple at (4, 9) and staying clear of Snake #2."

We need to navigate carefully to avoid any immediate danger while positioning ourselves to collect apples on future turns.\n\nThe apple at (0, 6) is in the bottom left corner, which is a safe location to head towards after collecting the apple at (4, 9). However, we need to ensure that we don't get trapped in the corner or cut off by Snake #2.\n\nConsidering the positions of the apples and the enemy snake, the best strategy is to move diagonally up and to the left, aiming to collect the apple at (4, 9) while keeping a safe distance from Snake #2. This will also position us to move towards the apples at (0, 6) and (0, 9) after securing the apple at (4, 9).\n\nSince the last move was recommended to be LEFT to position (7, 7), we should now move UP to position (6, 7).
