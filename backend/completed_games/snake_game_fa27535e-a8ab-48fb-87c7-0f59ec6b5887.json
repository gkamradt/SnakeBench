            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "Let's assess the current situation. I'm at position (3, 0) with an ID of 2, and there are apples at (7, 0), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 5), and (4, 4). The closest apple to me is at (1, 5), which is 5 units up and 2 units to the left from my current position. However, I should also consider the apple at (4, 4), which is 4 units up and 1 unit to the right from my current position.\n\nSince my last move was DOWN, I'm now at position (3, 0). I should move towards one of the closest apples. I'll choose the apple at (4, 4) as it seems to be a safer option, considering the position of Snake #1.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to move up and to the right towards the apple at (4, 4) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position and the board state to adjust my path if necessary.\n\nFor the next turn, I should be prepared to continue moving up and to the right to collect the apple, and then reassess the board state to plan my next move.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
