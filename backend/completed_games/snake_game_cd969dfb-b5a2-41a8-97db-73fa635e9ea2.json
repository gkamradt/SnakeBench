Let\u2019s analyze the distances to nearby apples and strategize the path.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n1. Apple at (6,7) - It is 2 units to the right and 2 units up from your current position.\n2. Apple at (6,4) - It is 2 units to the right and 1 unit down from your current position.\n3. Apple at (4,3) - It is directly downwards 2 units.\n4. Apple at (3,9) and (4,8) - These apples are farther away, to the left and significantly up (4 and 3 units respectively).\n\nGiven the current board and the positions of other snakes, the closest safe apple for you to pursue appears to be at (6,4). Although it's slightly downwards, aiming to eventually move right will strategically align better for future growth as it leads directly into another nearby apple at (6,7).\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- Moving directly downwards to the apple at (4,3) is tempting, but considering the pursuit of subsequent apples might be more strategic. Direct down movement limits movement freedoms post the apple at (4,3).\n- Rival Snake #2 is not an immediate threat based on its position. You have relatively clear paths to several apples without interference.\n- Heading right offers immediate access to apple at (6,4), and positions favorably for the subsequent apple at (6,7).\n\n**Proposed Strategy:**\nIf you move right, on the next turn, another right movement puts you in direct range of apple at (6,4). You also gain a safe route upwards to apple at (6,7), avoiding unnecessary detours or dead-ends.\n\n**Next Move:**\nConsidering the proximity and strategical positioning for subsequent moves, your best move currently would be to go RIGHT to (5,5). This move begins guiding you toward the apple at (6,4) and keeps you in excellent stance moving forward toward other apples and away from dead-end paths. Future moves might include another right or slight adjustment based on the enemy snake movements and new apple spawns.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove RIGHT."

This move gives a direct path to this apple and potentially sets a clear route to the next apple at (6,7).\n- Moving UP at this point could be a consideration to align vertically with the apple at (6,7), but it might delay reaching the closer apple at (6,4).\n\n**Rival Snake Considerations:**\n- Snake #2 at (2,2) is quite distant and doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat to me.\n- There\u2019s a clear opportunity to collect apples without conflict as no body segments are listed for Snake #2, which might indicate it's relatively weak or just started.\n\n**Immediate Next Move:**\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,5) is optimal. It brings me into direct line with the apple at (6,4). From (6,5) a simple move DOWN in the following turn will secure that apple.\n- Following the collection of the apple at (6,4), a realignment to move up to collect the apple at (6,7) could be easily managed.\n\n**Strategy for the Upcoming Move:**\n- Post obtaining the apple at (6,4), evaluate the position of Snake #2 and other potential new apple spawns.\n- Plan to move up to collect the apple at (6,7) unless there's a more strategically advantageous move due to changes in the board state.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove RIGHT."
