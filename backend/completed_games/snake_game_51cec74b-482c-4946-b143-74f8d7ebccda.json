The objective is to collect apples and maximize my points without running into obstacles or the opposing snake.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Immediate Risks:** \n   - Moving right is risky because Snake #2 is in that direction. This eliminates RIGHT as a viable option.\n   - It\u2019s safe to assume the area above us is open since the current position of both snakes is horizontally aligned. Moving UP is safe from immediate collision with Snake #2.\n\n2. **Objective - Closest Apple:** \n   - The apples are relatively scattered from my position.\n   - The apple at (5, 5) is relatively straightforward to reach in fewer moves, despite being a bit farther. It might offer the best path given Snake #2's current placement.\n   - Moving towards this apple directs the path either DOWN to pivot around potential conflicts or through calculated lateral movement.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - Prioritize avoiding direct conflict with Snake #2 for the initial few moves.\n   - Given Snake #2's position, claiming the apple at (5, 5) may avoid unnecessary confrontation, whereas navigating to a more densely populated area could increase risk.\n\n4. **Next Move Decision:**\n   - I will move DOWN to start getting closer to (5, 5), keeping an eye out on Snake #2's movements and adjusting my path if needed. \n   - Down opens up progressively moving towards that apple while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #2.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"
