To get to those, my safest path is to go down along the left side of the board to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nOnce I make it down there, I can focus on collecting those bottom apples and hopefully outscore the enemy snake. I'll just need to be mindful of not trapping myself in the bottom left corner.\n\nSo my strategy for the next few turns is to carefully make my way down the left side, then collect the bottom apples while avoiding getting cornered.
