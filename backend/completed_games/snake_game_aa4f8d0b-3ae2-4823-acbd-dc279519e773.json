            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the next move for my snake. I'm at position (8,1), and I need to decide whether to go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where the apples are. The apples are at (5,5), (5,2), (1,9), (5,7), and (9,8). My current position is (8,1), which is near the bottom right corner of the board. Hmm, that's interesting. \n\nSnake #1 is at (4,4), which is somewhere in the middle. Since the board is 10x10, my snake is at (8,1) so I'm close to the right edge. I need to stay within the board, so moving right from (8,1) would take me to (9,1), which is still within the board. Moving left would take me to (7,1), which is also fine. Up would take me to (8,2), and Down would take me to (8,0), but that's the bottom edge.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (5,2). Let me calculate the distance. From (8,1) to (5,2): the x difference is 3, and the y difference is 1. So, a diagonal distance of 4. Another apple is at (5,7), which is further away. The apple at (9,8) is also pretty far, but it's to the right and up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (5,5) as well. That's a bit further, but it's in the middle. The other apples are at (1,9), which is way up and to the left.\n\nConsidering that I want to collect an apple to grow, I should probably head towards the nearest one. The nearest apple seems to be at (5,2). So, how can I get there?\n\nFrom (8,1), moving left towards (5,1) and then up to (5,2) would be one path. Alternatively, moving up first to (8,2) and then left to (5,2). But I have to be careful not to run into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nSnake #1 is at (4,4), which is a few steps away. If I move left towards (5,2), I might not run into Snake #1. Let me plan the path.\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1). Then keep moving left until I reach (5,1). Then move UP to (5,2) to collect the apple. That seems doable. The path would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, then UP. But wait, the board might have other obstacles, but since the board state is provided, I can check each step.\n\nBut looking at the board state, I don't see any other snakes except myself at (8,1) and Snake #1 at (4,4). There's an apple at (5,2), so there's no snake there. So moving left should be safe as long as I don't hit the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nOption 2: Maybe move UP first to (8,2) and then LEFT towards (5,2). That might also work. Let me consider both options.\n\nIf I go LEFT first: (8,1) -> (7,1). Then LEFT to (6,1), then to (5,1). Then UP to (5,2). That's four moves.\n\nIf I go UP first: (8,1) -> (8,2). Then LEFT to (7,2), (6,2), (5,2). That's also four moves. So both paths take the same number of steps, but I need to check for any potential dangers along the way.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if the enemy snake is moving towards the same apple. If Snake #1 is at (4,4), heading towards (5,2) might mean it's moving down or left. I don't know the enemy's next move, but since the enemy is at (4,4), it's closer to (5,2) than I am. Hmm, maybe the enemy will reach the apple before me, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple to avoid competition. Let's see. The apple at (5,7) is further away, but it's also closer to the top. The apple at (9,8) is to the right and up. If I go right to (9,1), then up, but that's a long way.\n\nWait, considering my current position at (8,1), moving RIGHT to (9,1) is possible. Then I can go UP towards (9,8), but that's seven steps up. It's a longer path, and I might not reach it before someone else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go DOWN to (8,0), but that's the bottom edge. From there, I can go LEFT, but there's nothing important there.\n\nWait, maybe I should collect the apple at (5,2) first because it's closer. So, choosing between moving LEFT or UP first.\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm heading towards (5,1), which is a good spot because it's on the way to the apple. Alternatively, moving UP first might be better because I can control the vertical movement.\n\nI think moving LEFT first is better because I can then move straight left to (5,1) without worrying about the y-coordinate. Then, moving up once would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1), then to (6,1), (5,1), then up to (5,2). That seems straightforward. Alternatively, moving UP to (8,2), then LEFT, but that might take me further away.\n\nI think the LEFT path is better. So, my next move should be LEFT to (7,1).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the board state. The board shows that at (5,2) there's an apple. So, it's safe. Also, there's no enemy snake blocking the way as far as I can tell.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move LEFT, I'm moving towards (7,1), (6,1), etc., which are empty. So, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,1) might not be helpful unless I'm planning to go up to (9,8), but that's too far.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go LEFT towards (7,1) to start moving towards the apple at (5,2). That way, I can collect it before the enemy snake, who is at (4,4), which is a bit far but might also move towards it. But I think I can reach it first.\n\nAnother thought: if the enemy snake moves down to (4,3), (4,2), etc., it might block my path. But since I don't know their move, I have to assume they might not interfere. Alternatively, I can try to move towards the apple as quickly as possible.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move LEFT to (7,1) next, then continue moving LEFT towards (5,1), and then UP to (5,2) to collect the apple.\n\nAlternatively, what if I move UP first? From (8,1) to (8,2), then LEFT to (7,2), (6,2), etc. That might take longer, but I don't see any immediate blocks.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (4,4), so if I go LEFT towards (5,1), I'm not in their path. If I go UP to (8,2) and then LEFT, I might be moving through (5,2) sooner.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Both paths seem okay. Maybe moving LEFT first is better.\n\nAlso, I should consider if moving in another direction could lead me to an apple that's not contested by the enemy snake. But the closest apple is at (5,2), so I think that's the best target.\n\nIn conclusion, I think moving LEFT to (7,1) is the best next move to start heading towards the apple at (5,2).\n</think>\n\nMy next move is to go LEFT to start moving towards the apple at (5,2).\n\n**LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the next move for my snake. I'm at position (8,1), and I need to decide whether to go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where the apples are. The apples are at (5,5), (5,2), (1,9), (5,7), and (9,8). My current position is (8,1), which is near the bottom right corner of the board. Hmm, that's interesting. \n\nSnake #1 is at (4,4), which is somewhere in the middle. Since the board is 10x10, my snake is at (8,1) so I'm close to the right edge. I need to stay within the board, so moving right from (8,1) would take me to (9,1), which is still within the board. Moving left would take me to (7,1), which is also fine. Up would take me to (8,2), and Down would take me to (8,0), but that's the bottom edge.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (5,2). Let me calculate the distance. From (8,1) to (5,2): the x difference is 3, and the y difference is 1. So, a diagonal distance of 4. Another apple is at (5,7), which is further away. The apple at (9,8) is also pretty far, but it's to the right and up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (5,5) as well. That's a bit further, but it's in the middle. The other apples are at (1,9), which is way up and to the left.\n\nConsidering that I want to collect an apple to grow, I should probably head towards the nearest one. The nearest apple seems to be at (5,2). So, how can I get there?\n\nFrom (8,1), moving left towards (5,1) and then up to (5,2) would be one path. Alternatively, moving up first to (8,2) and then left to (5,2). But I have to be careful not to run into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nSnake #1 is at (4,4), which is a few steps away. If I move left towards (5,2), I might not run into Snake #1. Let me plan the path.\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1). Then keep moving left until I reach (5,1). Then move UP to (5,2) to collect the apple. That seems doable. The path would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, then UP. But wait, the board might have other obstacles, but since the board state is provided, I can check each step.\n\nBut looking at the board state, I don't see any other snakes except myself at (8,1) and Snake #1 at (4,4). There's an apple at (5,2), so there's no snake there. So moving left should be safe as long as I don't hit the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nOption 2: Maybe move UP first to (8,2) and then LEFT towards (5,2). That might also work. Let me consider both options.\n\nIf I go LEFT first: (8,1) -> (7,1). Then LEFT to (6,1), then to (5,1). Then UP to (5,2). That's four moves.\n\nIf I go UP first: (8,1) -> (8,2). Then LEFT to (7,2), (6,2), (5,2). That's also four moves. So both paths take the same number of steps, but I need to check for any potential dangers along the way.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if the enemy snake is moving towards the same apple. If Snake #1 is at (4,4), heading towards (5,2) might mean it's moving down or left. I don't know the enemy's next move, but since the enemy is at (4,4), it's closer to (5,2) than I am. Hmm, maybe the enemy will reach the apple before me, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple to avoid competition. Let's see. The apple at (5,7) is further away, but it's also closer to the top. The apple at (9,8) is to the right and up. If I go right to (9,1), then up, but that's a long way.\n\nWait, considering my current position at (8,1), moving RIGHT to (9,1) is possible. Then I can go UP towards (9,8), but that's seven steps up. It's a longer path, and I might not reach it before someone else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go DOWN to (8,0), but that's the bottom edge. From there, I can go LEFT, but there's nothing important there.\n\nWait, maybe I should collect the apple at (5,2) first because it's closer. So, choosing between moving LEFT or UP first.\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm heading towards (5,1), which is a good spot because it's on the way to the apple. Alternatively, moving UP first might be better because I can control the vertical movement.\n\nI think moving LEFT first is better because I can then move straight left to (5,1) without worrying about the y-coordinate. Then, moving up once would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1), then to (6,1), (5,1), then up to (5,2). That seems straightforward. Alternatively, moving UP to (8,2), then LEFT, but that might take me further away.\n\nI think the LEFT path is better. So, my next move should be LEFT to (7,1).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the board state. The board shows that at (5,2) there's an apple. So, it's safe. Also, there's no enemy snake blocking the way as far as I can tell.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move LEFT, I'm moving towards (7,1), (6,1), etc., which are empty. So, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,1) might not be helpful unless I'm planning to go up to (9,8), but that's too far.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go LEFT towards (7,1) to start moving towards the apple at (5,2). That way, I can collect it before the enemy snake, who is at (4,4), which is a bit far but might also move towards it. But I think I can reach it first.\n\nAnother thought: if the enemy snake moves down to (4,3), (4,2), etc., it might block my path. But since I don't know their move, I have to assume they might not interfere. Alternatively, I can try to move towards the apple as quickly as possible.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move LEFT to (7,1) next, then continue moving LEFT towards (5,1), and then UP to (5,2) to collect the apple.\n\nAlternatively, what if I move UP first? From (8,1) to (8,2), then LEFT to (7,2), (6,2), etc. That might take longer, but I don't see any immediate blocks.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (4,4), so if I go LEFT towards (5,1), I'm not in their path. If I go UP to (8,2) and then LEFT, I might be moving through (5,2) sooner.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Both paths seem okay. Maybe moving LEFT first is better.\n\nAlso, I should consider if moving in another direction could lead me to an apple that's not contested by the enemy snake. But the closest apple is at (5,2), so I think that's the best target.\n\nIn conclusion, I think moving LEFT to (7,1) is the best next move to start heading towards the apple at (5,2).\n</think>\n\nMy next move is to go LEFT to start moving towards the apple at (5,2).\n\n**LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I'm playing this snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. My snake is currently at position (6,1), and I have to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right. Let me start by looking at the board setup and the positions of the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nFirst, the apples are located at (5,2), (1,9), (5,7), (9,8), and (9,5). My snake is at (6,1), which is near the bottom right part of the board. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (5,5) with a body segment at (5,4). So, I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible to grow my snake and gain points. I should probably head towards the nearest apple to maximize my points quickly. Looking at the apples, the closest one to me is at (5,2). Let me measure the distance. From (6,1) to (5,2), that's one move to the left and one up. Alternatively, I could go left first and then up, or up then left. Either way, it's two moves.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (5,7), which is further away, so (5,2) is definitely closer. Also, there's an apple at (9,8) and (9,5), but those are way off. The apple at (1,9) is all the way to the top left, which is too far. So focusing on (5,2) makes sense.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (5,5). If I go towards (5,2), I'll have to pass near the enemy. Specifically, if I move left to (5,1) and then up to (5,2), I might be approaching the enemy's vicinity. The enemy is at (5,5) with a body at (5,4), so that's two units up from (5,2). So, I should be careful not to move into a position where I might get blocked or collide.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (6,1). If I move left, I go to (5,1), which is directly below (5,2). Then moving up to (5,2) gets me the apple. Alternatively, if I move up first, from (6,1) to (6,2), then left to (5,2). Either path seems viable, but moving left first might be safer because (5,1) is an empty spot.\n\nWait, what's at (5,1)? From the board state, it's empty, so moving left to (5,1) is safe. Then, from there, moving up to (5,2) to eat the apple. That seems like a solid plan.\n\nI should also check if there are any walls or other obstacles. Since the board goes from (0,0) to (9,9), (5,1) and (5,2) are well within the boundaries. No walls to worry about there.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the enemy snake's movement. Snake #1 is at (5,5) with a body at (5,4). If I'm moving towards (5,2), I'm going in the opposite direction, so there's no immediate threat unless the enemy moves down. But since I'm not going towards the enemy, it's probably not an issue this turn.\n\nAlso, I should make sure I'm not moving into my own body. Since my snake is only at (6,1) right now, and I'm moving to (5,1), there's no risk of collision with myself.\n\nSo, the plan is to move left first to (5,1), then up to (5,2) to get the apple. That should be safe and efficient.\n\nWait, another thought: After eating the apple at (5,2), my snake will grow. I should think about where to go next, maybe towards another apple. But for this move, the focus is on getting to (5,2).\n\nIs there any reason not to go left? Let me check the possible moves again. If I go left to (5,1), that's safe. If I go up to (6,2), that's also safe, but that doesn't get me closer to the apple. Going right would take me away from the apple. Going down to (6,0) is moving away as well. So, left is the best direction.\n\nYes, moving left to (5,1) is the correct next step towards getting the apple at (5,2). It avoids the enemy and any obstacles, and is the shortest path to the nearest apple.\n\nI think that's it. So, my next move should be LEFT to (5,1), and then I can decide on the next step after that.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the nearest apple safely, I should move LEFT towards (5,1), ensuring a clear path to the apple at (5,2) without encountering any obstacles or the enemy.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I'm playing this snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. My snake is currently at position (6,1), and I have to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right. Let me start by looking at the board setup and the positions of the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nFirst, the apples are located at (5,2), (1,9), (5,7), (9,8), and (9,5). My snake is at (6,1), which is near the bottom right part of the board. The enemy snake, snake #1, is at (5,5) with a body segment at (5,4). So, I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible to grow my snake and gain points. I should probably head towards the nearest apple to maximize my points quickly. Looking at the apples, the closest one to me is at (5,2). Let me measure the distance. From (6,1) to (5,2), that's one move to the left and one up. Alternatively, I could go left first and then up, or up then left. Either way, it's two moves.\n\nBut wait, there's another apple at (5,7), which is further away, so (5,2) is definitely closer. Also, there's an apple at (9,8) and (9,5), but those are way off. The apple at (1,9) is all the way to the top left, which is too far. So focusing on (5,2) makes sense.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake at (5,5). If I go towards (5,2), I'll have to pass near the enemy. Specifically, if I move left to (5,1) and then up to (5,2), I might be approaching the enemy's vicinity. The enemy is at (5,5) with a body at (5,4), so that's two units up from (5,2). So, I should be careful not to move into a position where I might get blocked or collide.\n\nLet me visualize the board. My snake is at (6,1). If I move left, I go to (5,1), which is directly below (5,2). Then moving up to (5,2) gets me the apple. Alternatively, if I move up first, from (6,1) to (6,2), then left to (5,2). Either path seems viable, but moving left first might be safer because (5,1) is an empty spot.\n\nWait, what's at (5,1)? From the board state, it's empty, so moving left to (5,1) is safe. Then, from there, moving up to (5,2) to eat the apple. That seems like a solid plan.\n\nI should also check if there are any walls or other obstacles. Since the board goes from (0,0) to (9,9), (5,1) and (5,2) are well within the boundaries. No walls to worry about there.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the enemy snake's movement. Snake #1 is at (5,5) with a body at (5,4). If I'm moving towards (5,2), I'm going in the opposite direction, so there's no immediate threat unless the enemy moves down. But since I'm not going towards the enemy, it's probably not an issue this turn.\n\nAlso, I should make sure I'm not moving into my own body. Since my snake is only at (6,1) right now, and I'm moving to (5,1), there's no risk of collision with myself.\n\nSo, the plan is to move left first to (5,1), then up to (5,2) to get the apple. That should be safe and efficient.\n\nWait, another thought: After eating the apple at (5,2), my snake will grow. I should think about where to go next, maybe towards another apple. But for this move, the focus is on getting to (5,2).\n\nIs there any reason not to go left? Let me check the possible moves again. If I go left to (5,1), that's safe. If I go up to (6,2), that's also safe, but that doesn't get me closer to the apple. Going right would take me away from the apple. Going down to (6,0) is moving away as well. So, left is the best direction.\n\nYes, moving left to (5,1) is the correct next step towards getting the apple at (5,2). It avoids the enemy and any obstacles, and is the shortest path to the nearest apple.\n\nI think that's it. So, my next move should be LEFT to (5,1), and then I can decide on the next step after that.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the nearest apple safely, I should move LEFT towards (5,1), ensuring a clear path to the apple at (5,2) without encountering any obstacles or the enemy.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the next move for my snake. I'm at position (8,1), and I need to decide whether to go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where the apples are. The apples are at (5,5), (5,2), (1,9), (5,7), and (9,8). My current position is (8,1), which is near the bottom right corner of the board. Hmm, that's interesting. \n\nSnake #1 is at (4,4), which is somewhere in the middle. Since the board is 10x10, my snake is at (8,1) so I'm close to the right edge. I need to stay within the board, so moving right from (8,1) would take me to (9,1), which is still within the board. Moving left would take me to (7,1), which is also fine. Up would take me to (8,2), and Down would take me to (8,0), but that's the bottom edge.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (5,2). Let me calculate the distance. From (8,1) to (5,2): the x difference is 3, and the y difference is 1. So, a diagonal distance of 4. Another apple is at (5,7), which is further away. The apple at (9,8) is also pretty far, but it's to the right and up.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (5,5) as well. That's a bit further, but it's in the middle. The other apples are at (1,9), which is way up and to the left.\n\nConsidering that I want to collect an apple to grow, I should probably head towards the nearest one. The nearest apple seems to be at (5,2). So, how can I get there?\n\nFrom (8,1), moving left towards (5,1) and then up to (5,2) would be one path. Alternatively, moving up first to (8,2) and then left to (5,2). But I have to be careful not to run into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nSnake #1 is at (4,4), which is a few steps away. If I move left towards (5,2), I might not run into Snake #1. Let me plan the path.\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1). Then keep moving left until I reach (5,1). Then move UP to (5,2) to collect the apple. That seems doable. The path would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, then UP. But wait, the board might have other obstacles, but since the board state is provided, I can check each step.\n\nBut looking at the board state, I don't see any other snakes except myself at (8,1) and Snake #1 at (4,4). There's an apple at (5,2), so there's no snake there. So moving left should be safe as long as I don't hit the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nOption 2: Maybe move UP first to (8,2) and then LEFT towards (5,2). That might also work. Let me consider both options.\n\nIf I go LEFT first: (8,1) -> (7,1). Then LEFT to (6,1), then to (5,1). Then UP to (5,2). That's four moves.\n\nIf I go UP first: (8,1) -> (8,2). Then LEFT to (7,2), (6,2), (5,2). That's also four moves. So both paths take the same number of steps, but I need to check for any potential dangers along the way.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if the enemy snake is moving towards the same apple. If Snake #1 is at (4,4), heading towards (5,2) might mean it's moving down or left. I don't know the enemy's next move, but since the enemy is at (4,4), it's closer to (5,2) than I am. Hmm, maybe the enemy will reach the apple before me, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for a different apple to avoid competition. Let's see. The apple at (5,7) is further away, but it's also closer to the top. The apple at (9,8) is to the right and up. If I go right to (9,1), then up, but that's a long way.\n\nWait, considering my current position at (8,1), moving RIGHT to (9,1) is possible. Then I can go UP towards (9,8), but that's seven steps up. It's a longer path, and I might not reach it before someone else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go DOWN to (8,0), but that's the bottom edge. From there, I can go LEFT, but there's nothing important there.\n\nWait, maybe I should collect the apple at (5,2) first because it's closer. So, choosing between moving LEFT or UP first.\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm heading towards (5,1), which is a good spot because it's on the way to the apple. Alternatively, moving UP first might be better because I can control the vertical movement.\n\nI think moving LEFT first is better because I can then move straight left to (5,1) without worrying about the y-coordinate. Then, moving up once would get me to the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1), then to (6,1), (5,1), then up to (5,2). That seems straightforward. Alternatively, moving UP to (8,2), then LEFT, but that might take me further away.\n\nI think the LEFT path is better. So, my next move should be LEFT to (7,1).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the board state. The board shows that at (5,2) there's an apple. So, it's safe. Also, there's no enemy snake blocking the way as far as I can tell.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if I move LEFT, I'm moving towards (7,1), (6,1), etc., which are empty. So, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,1) might not be helpful unless I'm planning to go up to (9,8), but that's too far.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go LEFT towards (7,1) to start moving towards the apple at (5,2). That way, I can collect it before the enemy snake, who is at (4,4), which is a bit far but might also move towards it. But I think I can reach it first.\n\nAnother thought: if the enemy snake moves down to (4,3), (4,2), etc., it might block my path. But since I don't know their move, I have to assume they might not interfere. Alternatively, I can try to move towards the apple as quickly as possible.\n\nSo, my strategy is to move LEFT to (7,1) next, then continue moving LEFT towards (5,1), and then UP to (5,2) to collect the apple.\n\nAlternatively, what if I move UP first? From (8,1) to (8,2), then LEFT to (7,2), (6,2), etc. That might take longer, but I don't see any immediate blocks.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (4,4), so if I go LEFT towards (5,1), I'm not in their path. If I go UP to (8,2) and then LEFT, I might be moving through (5,2) sooner.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Both paths seem okay. Maybe moving LEFT first is better.\n\nAlso, I should consider if moving in another direction could lead me to an apple that's not contested by the enemy snake. But the closest apple is at (5,2), so I think that's the best target.\n\nIn conclusion, I think moving LEFT to (7,1) is the best next move to start heading towards the apple at (5,2).\n</think>\n\nMy next move is to go LEFT to start moving towards the apple at (5,2).\n\n**LEFT**"

Since my snake is only at (6,1) right now, and I'm moving to (5,1), there's no risk of collision with myself.\n\nSo, the plan is to move left first to (5,1), then up to (5,2) to get the apple. That should be safe and efficient.\n\nWait, another thought: After eating the apple at (5,2), my snake will grow. I should think about where to go next, maybe towards another apple. But for this move, the focus is on getting to (5,2).\n\nIs there any reason not to go left? Let me check the possible moves again. If I go left to (5,1), that's safe. If I go up to (6,2), that's also safe, but that doesn't get me closer to the apple. Going right would take me away from the apple. Going down to (6,0) is moving away as well. So, left is the best direction.\n\nYes, moving left to (5,1) is the correct next step towards getting the apple at (5,2). It avoids the enemy and any obstacles, and is the shortest path to the nearest apple.\n\nI think that's it. So, my next move should be LEFT to (5,1), and then I can decide on the next step after that.\n</think>\n\nTo collect the nearest apple safely, I should move LEFT towards (5,1), ensuring a clear path to the apple at (5,2) without encountering any obstacles or the enemy.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out my next move in this Snake game. Let me start by understanding the current state of the board and where everything is located.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (5,2). I remember from the last move I was at (5,1) and decided to move UP to (5,2) to get the apple there. I should check if I successfully ate that apple. If I did, my snake probably grew, but I don't have information about that yet.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are located at (1,9), (9,8), (9,5), (7,1), (6,0). The closest one to me right now is (5,2), which I just moved into, so I should have collected it. Now, the next closest apple would be either (7,1) or maybe another one depending on the board.\n\nWait, no. The apple at (5,2) was not listed; maybe I was mistaken. Let me check again. The apples are at (1,9), (9,8), (9,5), (7,1), (6,0). Oh, wait, I think the apple at (5,2) isn't listed, so perhaps I had a mistake in the previous move. Hmm.\n\nWait no, looking back, I think in the previous state, the apple might have been at (5,2), but now I need to confirm. The board state shows that at position (5,2), there's a '2', which is my snake's head. So apples are elsewhere. So perhaps I didn't collect an apple last time; maybe I was wrong about that.\n\nSo, my snake is now at (5,2). The enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (5,7) with body at (5,6) and (5,5). That's a bit above me on the same x-coordinate. So if I go up from (5,2), I might head towards (5,3), (5,4), etc., but I have to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nThe apples are at (1,9), (9,8), (9,5), (7,1), and (6,0). The closest ones to me are (7,1) and (6,0). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (7,1): moving right twice and down once. So that's a distance of 3 steps.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (6,0): moving right once and down twice. That's also 3 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (9,5) is further away, requiring moving right four times and up three.\n\nSo the two closest apples are (7,1) and (6,0). I need to decide which one to go for.\n\nLet me think about the possible paths. If I go for (6,0), I can move right once from (5,2) to (6,2), then down twice to (6,0). That would require moving right and then down. Alternatively, I can move down first to (5,1), but that's where I was before moving up. Wait, no, my current position is (5,2), so I can go right to (6,2), then down twice.\n\nAlternatively, to get to (7,1), I can move right twice to (7,2), then down once to (7,1). That also seems feasible.\n\nI should check if there are any obstacles on these paths. The enemy snake is at (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), which is above me. So if I go up, I might run into them. But if I go right or down, I can avoid them.\n\nWait, the board shows that at (5,5), (5,6), and (5,7) are occupied by the enemy. So moving up from (5,2) towards (5,3) is possible, but going further up would cause collision.\n\nLet me think about the safest path. Going towards (6,0) would take me to the right and down, which seems safe as there's an apple there and no enemy nearby.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (7,1) would take me right and then down a bit, which is also safe.\n\nBut perhaps I should prioritize the apple at (6,0) because it's more isolated, while (7,1) might be closer to the enemy's position at (5,5), but that's not the case. The enemy is on the same x as me but higher y.\n\nWait, probably both paths are safe. So maybe I can choose either. But perhaps moving towards (6,0) is better because it's lower down, and I can collect that apple without interference.\n\nAlternatively, I could check if moving up is possible, but since the enemy is blocking the way up, it's risky. So better to avoid that.\n\nSo, the plan is to move towards the apple at (6,0). From (5,2), moving right to (6,2) would be the next step. Then, from there, moving down twice to reach (6,0). But I need to decide the direction now.\n\nWait, but I'm at (5,2). The next move could be RIGHT to (6,2), which is towards (6,0). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,1) might not help unless I'm going to turn again. Or perhaps I should move towards (5,3) to get to (5,5), but that's where the enemy is, so that's dangerous.\n\nSo the safest move is to move RIGHT to (6,2). But wait, is there any obstruction at (6,2)? Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board, it's a 10x10 grid. The rows are from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). The columns are from 0 (left) to 9 (right). So position (6,2) would be in row 2, column 6. I don't see any enemy snakes or apples at (6,2), so that should be safe.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT would take me towards (6,2), which is a step towards the apple at (6,0). Alternatively, after that, I can decide whether to move down.\n\nSo, the next move should be RIGHT to (6,2). That way, I'm moving towards the apple at (6,0) without any immediate threats.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other apples closer, but I think (6,0) is the closest and safest option right now.\n\nSo, my next move is to go RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo move towards the apple at (6,0), the next direction is RIGHT.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"
