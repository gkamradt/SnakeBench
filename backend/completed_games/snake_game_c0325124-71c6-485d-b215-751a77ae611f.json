The closest apple is now located at (3, 0), which is to the left and down from the snake's current position.\n\nHowever, moving directly towards this apple would put the snake in close proximity to the enemy snake (Snake #1) at (4, 8). Therefore, it would be wise to avoid moving directly towards the enemy snake and instead opt for a safer route.\n\nThe next closest apple is located at (9, 2), which is to the right and down from the snake's current position. Moving towards this apple would not only allow the snake to gain a point and grow in length, but also position it further away from the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy would be to move down towards the apple at (9, 2). This will not only allow the snake to gain a point and grow in length, but also position it further away from the enemy snake.\n\nAfter moving down, the snake will be in a good position to target the apple at (3, 0) in the subsequent move. It's important to continue monitoring the position of the enemy snake and adjust the strategy accordingly to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\n--End of your move information.--"
