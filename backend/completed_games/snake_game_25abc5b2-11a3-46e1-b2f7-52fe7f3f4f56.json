That\u2019s a collision.\n\u2022 Moving LEFT would take us to (1,9). Although that square is currently occupied by our tail (\u201cT\u201d), if we don\u2019t eat an apple the tail will move, so it would be safe\u2014but it doesn\u2019t help us get closer to any apple.\n\u2022 Moving RIGHT sends us to (3,9), which is free. This not only avoids danger but also moves us closer to the nearest apple at (4,7) (a Manhattan distance of 3 from (3,9) vs. 4 from (2,9)).\n\nThus, the best and safest move is to go RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT"
