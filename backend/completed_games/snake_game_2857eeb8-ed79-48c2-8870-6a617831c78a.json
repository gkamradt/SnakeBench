That means we must avoid moving back into (8,8).\n\nLooking at the nearest apples:\n\u2022 Apple at (6,5) is (dx, dy) = (\u20133, \u20133) from our head.\n\u2022 Apple at (7,4) is (dx, dy) = (\u20132, \u20134).\n\nBoth are down and to the left of our current head position (9,8). We can\u2019t move left because that would send us into our own body at (8,8). Our safe options are UP (to (9,9)) and DOWN (to (9,7)). While UP is safe, going UP moves us in the opposite vertical direction from our apples. Instead, moving DOWN to (9,7) not only stays within bounds but also brings us closer vertically to the cluster of apples.\n\nThus, the safest and strategically best move is to go DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

Both of these lie to the left and down from our current head. \n\n3. From (9,7) our legal moves are:\n\u2003\u2022 UP \u2192 (9,8) but that cell is occupied by our own body.\n\u2003\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (10,7) is off the board.\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (9,6) is safe but it only moves us downward.\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT \u2192 (8,7) is safe and brings us closer to the apples horizontally.\n\n4. Since our goal is to reach the apple cluster\u2014and (8,7) positions us closer to (6,5) and (7,4)\u2014the best move at this moment is to go LEFT.\n\nThus, my next move is: LEFT."

The best strategy seems to be moving towards the apple at (6, 2) while keeping the option to move in any direction after collecting it.\n\nHere's the plan: Move RIGHT to (5, 0), then move UP to (5, 1), and finally move RIGHT to (6, 1).
