There are apples at (8,2), (5,8), (1,3), (9,0), and (6,5). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (8,2): Row 2, Column 8\n\n- (5,8): Row 8, Column 5\n\n- (1,3): Row 3, Column 1\n\n- (9,0): Row 0, Column 9\n\n- (6,5): Row 5, Column 6\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,6): Row 6, Column 3.\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I assume multiple snakes are on the board, but only snake #1 is mentioned. I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings of my snake at (4,1).\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n. . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nSo, at column 4, row 1, that's me.\n\nLet's see what's around me:\n\n- Up (increase Y): Row 2, Column 4\n\n- Down (decrease Y): Row 0, Column 4\n\n- Left (decrease X): Row 1, Column 3\n\n- Right (increase X): Row 1, Column 5\n\nLet's check each direction for possible moves.\n\nUp: Row 2, Column 4\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n. . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 4 in row 2 is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nDown: Row 0, Column 4\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 4 in row 0 is empty. Safe.\n\nLeft: Row 1, Column 3\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nColumn 3 in row 1 is empty. Safe.\n\nRight: Row 1, Column 5\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nColumn 5 in row 1 is empty. Safe.\n\nSo, all immediate directions are safe for the first move.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. The goal is to eat apples and score points, while avoiding enemies and not dying.\n\nLet's think about which apple is closest or easiest to reach.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nApples:\n\n- (8,2): Delta X=4, Delta Y=1 \u2192 5 steps (4 right, 1 up)\n\n- (5,8): Delta X=1, Delta Y=7 \u2192 8 steps (1 right, 7 up)\n\n- (1,3): Delta X=3, Delta Y=2 \u2192 5 steps (3 left, 2 up)\n\n- (9,0): Delta X=5, Delta Y=1 \u2192 6 steps (5 right, 1 down)\n\n- (6,5): Delta X=2, Delta Y=4 \u2192 6 steps (2 right, 4 up)\n\nConsidering just the step counts, apples at (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nBut I need to consider the paths and potential dangers.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (8,2) first.\n\nTo get to (8,2), I need to move right 4 steps and up 1 step.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at row 1: columns 5 and 6 are empty (assuming, since not specified).\n\nRow 2: columns 4,5,6,7,8 are empty except for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy is at (3,6), which is row 6, column 3.\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (8,2). So, probably safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (1,3): left 3 steps and up 2 steps.\n\nRow 1: left 3 steps: columns 1,2,3 are empty.\n\nRow 2: column 1 is empty.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider which one to go for first.\n\nMaybe going for the closer one first is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet's consider the positions:\n\nIf I go to (8,2), then from there, I can consider moving to (5,8), but that's a long way up.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,2), I can look for other apples in the area.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nLet me consider the positions of all apples and plan a path that allows me to eat as many as possible without crossing my own path.\n\nThis sounds like a variant of the traveling salesman problem, but simplified since the graph is a grid and I have to avoid overlapping paths.\n\nBut that's too complex for now. Maybe I can just prioritize the closest apples one by one.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position to each apple, and then from each apple to the next closest apple.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nDistances to apples:\n\n- (8,2): dx=4, dy=1, steps=5\n\n- (5,8): dx=1, dy=7, steps=8\n\n- (1,3): dx=3, dy=2, steps=5\n\n- (9,0): dx=5, dy=1, steps=6\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=4, steps=6\n\nSo, (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nLet's consider (8,2) first.\n\nFrom (8,2), let's see the distances to other apples:\n\n- (5,8): dx=3, dy=6, steps=9\n\n- (1,3): dx=7, dy=1, steps=8\n\n- (9,0): dx=1, dy=2, steps=3\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=3, steps=5\n\nSo, from (8,2), the closest apple is (9,0) at 3 steps.\n\nThen from (9,0), the closest apple is (6,5) at dx=3, dy=2, steps=5.\n\nThen from (6,5), the closest apple is (5,8) at dx=1, dy=3, steps=4.\n\nFinally, from (5,8), the closest apple is (1,3) at dx=4, dy=5, steps=9.\n\nThis seems like a possible path, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't block my own path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (1,3) first, since it's also 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (1,3), the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,2): dx=7, dy=1, steps=8\n\n- (5,8): dx=4, dy=5, steps=9\n\n- (9,0): dx=8, dy=3, steps=11\n\n- (6,5): dx=5, dy=2, steps=7\n\nSo, from (1,3), the closest apple is (6,5) at 7 steps.\n\nThen from (6,5), closest is (5,8) at 1 step (dx=1, dy=3, steps=4).\n\nThen from (5,8), closest is (8,2) at 4 steps.\n\nThen from (8,2), closest is (9,0) at 1 step.\n\nThis seems another possible path.\n\nBut considering the first path I thought of, going to (8,2), then (9,0), then (6,5), then (5,8), then (1,3), seems shorter in terms of total steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that as I grow, I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, every time I eat an apple, my snake grows, so I need to"

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple Snake game, I assume multiple snakes are on the board, but only snake #1 is mentioned. I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings of my snake at (4,2).\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n. . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, at column 4, row 2 is empty. Wait, but my snake is at (4,2), so there might be a mistake in interpreting the positions.\n\nWait, actually, in the board state provided, snake #2 is at (4,2), but in the initial information, it says snake #2 is at (4,1). There seems to be inconsistency here.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: UP\n\nRationale: ...\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (4,1)\", but in the board state, snake #2 is at (4,1). But in the \"Board state\" section, it shows snake #2 at position (4,1), which is row 1, column 4.\n\nWait, but in the last move information, it says \"Your last move information: Direction: UP\", meaning you moved up from some previous position to (4,1).\n\nBut in the board state, snake #2 is at (4,1), and enemy snake #1 is at (4,6).\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between rows and columns.\n\nIn the board state, positions are given as (row, column), so (4,1) means row 4, column 1.\n\nBut in the coordinate system, it's (column, row), with (0,0) at the bottom left.\n\nWait, no, in the initial information, it says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nBut in the board state, it's shown with row numbers increasing upwards, and columns from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, position (4,2) would be column 4, row 2.\n\nWait, but in the board state, snake #2 is at (4,1), which is column 4, row 1.\n\nI need to clarify this to avoid confusion.\n\nAssuming that the board state is correct, and snake #2 is at (4,1), I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, snake #2 at (4,1), which is column 4, row 1.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (4,2)\n\n- Down: to (4,0)\n\n- Left: to (3,1)\n\n- Right: to (5,1)\n\nLet's check each direction for safety and potential apple consumption.\n\nUp: (4,2)\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 4 in row 2 is empty. Safe to move there. No apple there immediately, but there's an apple at (8,2), which is column 8, row 2.\n\nDown: (4,0)\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 4 in row 0 is empty. Safe.\n\nLeft: (3,1)\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nColumn 3 in row 1 is empty. Safe.\n\nRight: (5,1)\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nColumn 5 in row 1 is empty. Safe.\n\nSo, all directions are safe for the first move.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. The goal is to eat apples and score points, while avoiding enemies and not dying.\n\nLet's think about which apple is closest or easiest to reach.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nApples:\n\n- (8,2): Delta X=4, Delta Y=1 \u2192 5 steps (4 right, 1 up)\n\n- (5,8): Delta X=1, Delta Y=7 \u2192 8 steps (1 right, 7 up)\n\n- (1,3): Delta X=3, Delta Y=2 \u2192 5 steps (3 left, 2 up)\n\n- (9,0): Delta X=5, Delta Y=1 \u2192 6 steps (5 right, 1 down)\n\n- (6,5): Delta X=2, Delta Y=4 \u2192 6 steps (2 right, 4 up)\n\nConsidering just the step counts, apples at (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nBut I need to consider the paths and potential dangers.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (8,2) first.\n\nTo get to (8,2), I need to move right 4 steps and up 1 step.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at row 1: columns 5 and 6 are empty (assuming, since not specified).\n\nRow 2: columns 4,5,6,7,8 are empty except for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy is at (4,6), which is column 4, row 6.\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (8,2). So, probably safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (1,3): left 3 steps and up 2 steps.\n\nRow 1: left 3 steps: columns 1,2,3 are empty.\n\nRow 2: column 1 is empty.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider which one to go for first.\n\nMaybe going for the closer one first is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nThis sounds like a variant of the traveling salesman problem, but simplified since the graph is a grid and I have to avoid overlapping paths.\n\nBut that's too complex for now. Maybe I can just prioritize the closest apples one by one.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position to each apple, and then from each apple to the next closest apple.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nDistances to apples:\n\n- (8,2): dx=4, dy=1, steps=5\n\n- (5,8): dx=1, dy=7, steps=8\n\n- (1,3): dx=3, dy=2, steps=5\n\n- (9,0): dx=5, dy=1, steps=6\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=4, steps=6\n\nSo, (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nLet's consider (8,2) first.\n\nFrom (8,2), let's see the distances to other apples:\n\n- (5,8): dx=3, dy=6, steps=9\n\n- (1,3): dx=7, dy=1, steps=8\n\n- (9,0): dx=1, dy=2, steps=3\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=3, steps=5\n\nSo, from (8,2), the closest apple is (9,0) at 3 steps.\n\nThen from (9,0), the closest apple is (6,5"

Maybe I can just prioritize the closest apples one by one.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position to each apple, and then from each apple to the next closest apple.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nDistances to apples:\n\n- (8,2): dx=4, dy=1, steps=5\n\n- (5,8): dx=1, dy=7, steps=8\n\n- (1,3): dx=3, dy=2, steps=5\n\n- (9,0): dx=5, dy=1, steps=6\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=4, steps=6\n\nSo, (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nLet's consider (8,2) first.\n\nFrom (8,2), let's see the distances to other apples:\n\n- (5,8): dx=3, dy=6, steps=9\n\n- (1,3): dx=7, dy=1, steps=8\n\n- (9,0): dx=1, dy=2, steps=3\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=3, steps=5\n\nSo, from (8,2), the closest apple is (9,0) at 3 steps.\n\nThen from (9,0), the closest apple is (6,5"

There are apples at (8,2), (5,8), (1,3), (9,0), and (6,5). There's also an enemy snake #1 at (5,6).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . 2 . . . .

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple Snake game, I assume multiple snakes are on the board, but only snake #1 is mentioned. I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings of my snake at (3,2).\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n. . . 2 . . . . A .\n\nSo, at column 3, row 2 is my snake's head.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\n1. Up: to (3,3)\n\n2. Down: to (3,1)\n\n3. Left: to (2,2)\n\n4. Right: to (4,2)\n\nLet's check each direction for safety and potential apple proximity.\n\n**Up: (3,3)**\n\n- Check row 3, column 3:\n\n- From the board, row 3: . A . . . . . . . .\n\n- Column 3: looking at row 3, column 3 is empty.\n\n- No immediate apple, but there's an apple at (1,3), which is column 1, row 3.\n\n- To get to (1,3), I'd need to move left to (2,3), then to (1,3).\n\n- But first, I need to see if I can reach (3,3) safely.\n\n- Also, consider the enemy snake at (5,6). Not immediately threatening.\n\n**Down: (3,1)**\n\n- Check row 1, column 3:\n\n- From the board, row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Column 3: looking at row 1, column 3 is empty.\n\n- No immediate apple. Need to see if moving down gets me closer to any apple.\n\n- Moving down to (3,1), then possibly left or right.\n\n**Left: (2,2)**\n\n- Check row 2, column 2:\n\n- From the board, row 2: . . . 2 . . . . A .\n\n- Column 2: looking at row 2, column 2 is empty.\n\n- No immediate apple. Need to see if moving left gets me closer to any apple.\n\n- Moving left to (2,2), then possibly up or down.\n\n**Right: (4,2)**\n\n- Check row 2, column 4:\n\n- From the board, row 2: . . . 2 . . . . A .\n\n- Column 4: looking at row 2, column 4 is empty.\n\n- There's an apple at (8,2), which is column 8, row 2. So, moving right would bring me closer to that apple.\n\n- To get to (8,2), I need to move right 5 times from (3,2).\n\n- Need to ensure the path is clear.\n\nLet me check the path to (8,2):\n\n- From (3,2) to (4,2): empty\n\n- From (4,2) to (5,2): empty\n\n- From (5,2) to (6,2): empty\n\n- From (6,2) to (7,2): empty\n\n- From (7,2) to (8,2): empty\n\n- Once at (8,2), I can eat the apple and grow.\n\n- After eating (8,2), next apple could be (9,0): move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then right to (9,0).\n\n- But need to ensure the path is clear and no enemies are in the way.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (5,6), which is not on this path. So, it should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,3), which is column 1, row 3.\n\nTo get there:\n\n- From (3,2), move up to (3,3), then left to (2,3), then to (1,3).\n\n- This seems shorter in terms of steps, but there's another apple at (8,2) which is further away.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet me think about the distances.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- To (8,2): 5 steps right\n\n- To (1,3): 2 steps up and 2 steps left\n\nSo, (1,3) is closer in terms of steps.\n\nBut after eating (1,3), the next closest apple might be further away.\n\nWhereas, if I go for (8,2), I can pick up another apple at (9,0) afterwards.\n\nLet me calculate the total steps for each scenario.\n\n**Scenario 1: Go to (1,3) first**\n\n- Steps to (1,3): 2 up, 2 left = 4 steps\n\n- Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n- Now, next apple: (8,2) is 7 steps right, 1 step down\n\n- Total steps: 4 + 8 = 12 steps\n\n**Scenario 2: Go to (8,2) first**\n\n- Steps to (8,2): 5 steps right\n\n- Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n- Next apple: (9,0): 1 step right, 2 steps down\n\n- Total steps: 5 + 3 = 8 steps\n\nSo, going for (8,2) first is more efficient in terms of steps.\n\nAlso, after eating (8,2), I can easily go to (9,0), then perhaps to (6,5), and so on.\n\nMoreover, moving right towards (8,2) doesn't bring me closer to the enemy snake at (5,6), so it's safer.\n\nWhereas, moving up towards (1,3) would bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, I think it's better to go for (8,2) first.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right.\n\nBut before deciding, I need to make sure that moving right is safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, columns 3 to 8:\n\n- Columns 3: empty\n\n- Columns 4: empty\n\n- Columns 5: empty\n\n- Columns 6: empty\n\n- Columns 7: empty\n\n- Columns 8: apple at (8,2)\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nTherefore, I should move right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving right towards the apple at (8,2) is more efficient in terms of steps.\n\n- It avoids bringing me closer to the enemy snake.\n\n- The path is clear, and I can safely reach the apple.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\n- Continue moving right until reaching (8,2), then adjust direction to pick up the next closest apple, likely (9,0)."

But in the \"Board state\" section, it shows snake #2 at position (4,1), which is row 1, column 4.\n\nWait, but in the last move information, it says \"Your last move information: Direction: UP\", meaning you moved up from some previous position to (4,1).\n\nBut in the board state, snake #2 is at (4,1), and enemy snake #1 is at (4,6).\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between rows and columns.\n\nIn the board state, positions are given as (row, column), so (4,1) means row 4, column 1.\n\nBut in the coordinate system, it's (column, row), with (0,0) at the bottom left.\n\nWait, no, in the initial information, it says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nBut in the board state, it's shown with row numbers increasing upwards, and columns from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, position (4,2) would be column 4, row 2.\n\nWait, but in the board state, snake #2 is at (4,1), which is column 4, row 1.\n\nI need to clarify this to avoid confusion.\n\nAssuming that the board state is correct, and snake #2 is at (4,1), I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, snake #2 at (4,1), which is column 4, row 1.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (4,2)\n\n- Down: to (4,0)\n\n- Left: to (3,1)\n\n- Right: to (5,1)\n\nLet's check each direction for safety and potential apple consumption.\n\nUp: (4,2)\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 4 in row 2 is empty. Safe to move there. No apple there immediately, but there's an apple at (8,2), which is column 8, row 2.\n\nDown: (4,0)\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 4 in row 0 is empty. Safe.\n\nLeft: (3,1)\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nColumn 3 in row 1 is empty. Safe.\n\nRight: (5,1)\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nColumn 5 in row 1 is empty. Safe.\n\nSo, all directions are safe for the first move.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. The goal is to eat apples and score points, while avoiding enemies and not dying.\n\nLet's think about which apple is closest or easiest to reach.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nApples:\n\n- (8,2): Delta X=4, Delta Y=1 \u2192 5 steps (4 right, 1 up)\n\n- (5,8): Delta X=1, Delta Y=7 \u2192 8 steps (1 right, 7 up)\n\n- (1,3): Delta X=3, Delta Y=2 \u2192 5 steps (3 left, 2 up)\n\n- (9,0): Delta X=5, Delta Y=1 \u2192 6 steps (5 right, 1 down)\n\n- (6,5): Delta X=2, Delta Y=4 \u2192 6 steps (2 right, 4 up)\n\nConsidering just the step counts, apples at (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nBut I need to consider the paths and potential dangers.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (8,2) first.\n\nTo get to (8,2), I need to move right 4 steps and up 1 step.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at row 1: columns 5 and 6 are empty (assuming, since not specified).\n\nRow 2: columns 4,5,6,7,8 are empty except for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy is at (4,6), which is column 4, row 6.\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (8,2). So, probably safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (1,3): left 3 steps and up 2 steps.\n\nRow 1: left 3 steps: columns 1,2,3 are empty.\n\nRow 2: column 1 is empty.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider which one to go for first.\n\nMaybe going for the closer one first is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nThis sounds like a variant of the traveling salesman problem, but simplified since the graph is a grid and I have to avoid overlapping paths.\n\nBut that's too complex for now. Maybe I can just prioritize the closest apples one by one.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position to each apple, and then from each apple to the next closest apple.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nDistances to apples:\n\n- (8,2): dx=4, dy=1, steps=5\n\n- (5,8): dx=1, dy=7, steps=8\n\n- (1,3): dx=3, dy=2, steps=5\n\n- (9,0): dx=5, dy=1, steps=6\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=4, steps=6\n\nSo, (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nLet's consider (8,2) first.\n\nFrom (8,2), let's see the distances to other apples:\n\n- (5,8): dx=3, dy=6, steps=9\n\n- (1,3): dx=7, dy=1, steps=8\n\n- (9,0): dx=1, dy=2, steps=3\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=3, steps=5\n\nSo, from (8,2), the closest apple is (9,0) at 3 steps.\n\nThen from (9,0), the closest apple is (6,5"

There are apples at (8,2), (5,8), (1,3), (9,0), and (6,5). There's also an enemy snake #1 at (5,6).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . 2 . . . .

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple Snake game, I assume multiple snakes are on the board, but only snake #1 is mentioned. I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings of my snake at (3,2).\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n. . . 2 . . . . A .\n\nSo, at column 3, row 2 is my snake's head.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\n1. Up: to (3,3)\n\n2. Down: to (3,1)\n\n3. Left: to (2,2)\n\n4. Right: to (4,2)\n\nLet's check each direction for safety and potential apple proximity.\n\n**Up: (3,3)**\n\n- Check row 3, column 3:\n\n- From the board, row 3: . A . . . . . . . .\n\n- Column 3: looking at row 3, column 3 is empty.\n\n- No immediate apple, but there's an apple at (1,3), which is column 1, row 3.\n\n- To get to (1,3), I'd need to move left to (2,3), then to (1,3).\n\n- But first, I need to see if I can reach (3,3) safely.\n\n- Also, consider the enemy snake at (5,6). Not immediately threatening.\n\n**Down: (3,1)**\n\n- Check row 1, column 3:\n\n- From the board, row 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Column 3: looking at row 1, column 3 is empty.\n\n- No immediate apple. Need to see if moving down gets me closer to any apple.\n\n- Moving down to (3,1), then possibly left or right.\n\n**Left: (2,2)**\n\n- Check row 2, column 2:\n\n- From the board, row 2: . . . 2 . . . . A .\n\n- Column 2: looking at row 2, column 2 is empty.\n\n- No immediate apple. Need to see if moving left gets me closer to any apple.\n\n- Moving left to (2,2), then possibly up or down.\n\n**Right: (4,2)**\n\n- Check row 2, column 4:\n\n- From the board, row 2: . . . 2 . . . . A .\n\n- Column 4: looking at row 2, column 4 is empty.\n\n- There's an apple at (8,2), which is column 8, row 2. So, moving right would bring me closer to that apple.\n\n- To get to (8,2), I need to move right 5 times from (3,2).\n\n- Need to ensure the path is clear.\n\nLet me check the path to (8,2):\n\n- From (3,2) to (4,2): empty\n\n- From (4,2) to (5,2): empty\n\n- From (5,2) to (6,2): empty\n\n- From (6,2) to (7,2): empty\n\n- From (7,2) to (8,2): empty\n\n- Once at (8,2), I can eat the apple and grow.\n\n- After eating (8,2), next apple could be (9,0): move down to (8,1), then (8,0), then right to (9,0).\n\n- But need to ensure the path is clear and no enemies are in the way.\n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (5,6), which is not on this path. So, it should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,3), which is column 1, row 3.\n\nTo get there:\n\n- From (3,2), move up to (3,3), then left to (2,3), then to (1,3).\n\n- This seems shorter in terms of steps, but there's another apple at (8,2) which is further away.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nLet me think about the distances.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- To (8,2): 5 steps right\n\n- To (1,3): 2 steps up and 2 steps left\n\nSo, (1,3) is closer in terms of steps.\n\nBut after eating (1,3), the next closest apple might be further away.\n\nWhereas, if I go for (8,2), I can pick up another apple at (9,0) afterwards.\n\nLet me calculate the total steps for each scenario.\n\n**Scenario 1: Go to (1,3) first**\n\n- Steps to (1,3): 2 up, 2 left = 4 steps\n\n- Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n- Now, next apple: (8,2) is 7 steps right, 1 step down\n\n- Total steps: 4 + 8 = 12 steps\n\n**Scenario 2: Go to (8,2) first**\n\n- Steps to (8,2): 5 steps right\n\n- Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n- Next apple: (9,0): 1 step right, 2 steps down\n\n- Total steps: 5 + 3 = 8 steps\n\nSo, going for (8,2) first is more efficient in terms of steps.\n\nAlso, after eating (8,2), I can easily go to (9,0), then perhaps to (6,5), and so on.\n\nMoreover, moving right towards (8,2) doesn't bring me closer to the enemy snake at (5,6), so it's safer.\n\nWhereas, moving up towards (1,3) would bring me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, I think it's better to go for (8,2) first.\n\nSo, my first move should be to the right.\n\nBut before deciding, I need to make sure that moving right is safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, columns 3 to 8:\n\n- Columns 3: empty\n\n- Columns 4: empty\n\n- Columns 5: empty\n\n- Columns 6: empty\n\n- Columns 7: empty\n\n- Columns 8: apple at (8,2)\n\nSo, the path is clear.\n\nTherefore, I should move right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving right towards the apple at (8,2) is more efficient in terms of steps.\n\n- It avoids bringing me closer to the enemy snake.\n\n- The path is clear, and I can safely reach the apple.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\n- Continue moving right until reaching (8,2), then adjust direction to pick up the next closest apple, likely (9,0)."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (3,3), and I need to choose between moving up, down, left, or right. There are apples at (8,2), (5,8), (1,3), (9,0), and (6,5). Also, there's an enemy snake at (6,6).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (3,3):\n\n- To (8,2): I need to move right 5 times and down 1 time. That's a total of 6 moves.\n\n- To (5,8): That's right 2 times and up 5 times. That's 7 moves.\n\n- To (1,3): Left 2 times. Just 2 moves.\n\n- To (9,0): Right 6 times and down 3 times. That's 9 moves.\n\n- To (6,5): Right 3 times and up 2 times. That's 5 moves.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,3), only 2 moves away. But I should also consider if there are any obstacles or if it's safe to go there.\n\nLooking at the board, if I move left to (2,3), then left again to (1,3), that seems straightforward. No enemy snakes in that area as far as I can tell.\n\nBut, I should also think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating (1,3), the next closest apple would be (6,5), which is right 5 times and up 2 times. That's 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (6,5) directly from (3,3), it's only 3 rights and 2 ups, totaling 5 moves. That might be more efficient.\n\nWait, but (1,3) is closer at only 2 moves. So, maybe I should go for (1,3) first, eat it, and then head to (6,5).\n\nLet me think about the points. Each apple gives me one point, so the more apples I can eat, the better. But I also need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the enemy snake's position at (6,6). If I go towards (6,5), which is adjacent to the enemy, I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nMaybe it's safer to go for (1,3) first, since it's farther away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (8,2), which is right 5 times and up 1 time, totaling 6 moves. After eating that, I can go to (9,0), which is just down 2 times from there.\n\nSo, let's compare the two strategies:\n\nStrategy A:\n\n1. Go to (1,3): 2 moves\n\n2. Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n3. Go to (6,5): right 5 times, up 2 times = 7 moves\n\n4. Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n5. Go to another apple\n\nTotal moves: 2 + 7 = 9 moves for 2 apples\n\nStrategy B:\n\n1. Go to (8,2): right 5 times, up 1 time = 6 moves\n\n2. Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n3. Go to (9,0): right 1 time, down 2 times = 3 moves\n\n4. Eat apple, grow by 1\n\nTotal moves: 6 + 3 = 9 moves for 2 apples\n\nSo, both strategies take the same number of moves for 2 apples. But in Strategy A, after eating (1,3), I have to traverse a longer distance to (6,5), while in Strategy B, after eating (8,2), I can quickly go to (9,0).\n\nAdditionally, in Strategy A, I'm moving towards the enemy snake, which might be risky, while in Strategy B, I'm moving away from it.\n\nTherefore, Strategy B seems safer and more efficient.\n\nLet me also consider the apple at (5,8). That's right 2 times and up 5 times, totaling 7 moves. That's longer than going to (8,2), so it's probably not the best choice right now.\n\nSo, my plan is to go to (8,2) first, then to (9,0), and then see what's next.\n\nNow, for my immediate move, since I'm at (3,3), I need to start moving right towards (8,2).\n\nBut before I do that, I should check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- Right to (4,3): empty\n\n- Right to (5,3): empty\n\n- Right to (6,3): empty\n\n- Right to (7,3): empty\n\n- Right to (8,3): empty\n\nThen, up to (8,2): one move up.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (8,2), which is left from (8,3). Wait, no: coordinates are (x,y), so (8,2) is column 8, row 2, which is down from (8,3).\n\nWait, in this game, higher Y is up, so (8,2) is actually down from (8,3).\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nGiven that row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row, then higher Y is up.\n\nSo, from (8,3), to (8,2) is down.\n\nBut in the board, row numbers increase upwards, so row 0 is bottom, row 9 is top.\n\nTherefore, moving from (8,3) to (8,2) is moving down.\n\nSo, to reach (8,2) from (3,3), I need to move right 5 times to reach (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to the right.\n\nBut wait, I'm at (3,3). If I move right to (4,3), then right to (5,3), and so on, up to (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nBut in my initial thought, I thought of moving right to (8,3), then up to (8,2), but that's incorrect because (8,2) is down from (8,3).\n\nSo, I need to make sure I'm moving in the right direction.\n\nWait, no, (8,2) is down from (8,3), since higher Y is up.\n\nSo, from (8,3), to (8,2) is down.\n\nTherefore, from (3,3), I need to move right 5 times to (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nGot it.\n\nNow, considering that, I need to make a series of right moves to reach (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nBut for my immediate next move, I should just move right.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that moving right is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no obstacles in the path from (3,3) to (8,3). It's all open.\n\nAfter reaching (8,3), I can then move down to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can then move right to (9,2), then down to (9,1), then down to (9,0) to eat another apple.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (8,2), I could consider going to (6,5), but (9,0) is closer, being just down 2 and right 1.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), to (9,0), it's right 1, down 2.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,1), then down to (9,0).\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nTo (6,5), from (8,2), it's left 2, up 3, which is 5 moves.\n\nSo, (9,0) is closer after eating (8,2).\n\nTherefore, sticking with Strategy B seems better.\n\nNow, to execute this, I need to start moving right towards (8,2).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to the right.\n\nBut, I should also consider if there's any immediate threat from the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,6), which is up and to the right from my current position.\n\nBut, I'm planning to move right, away from the enemy.\n\nTherefore, moving right seems safe.\n\nMoreover, moving right doesn't bring me closer to any walls or other snakes.\n\nHence, my decision is to move right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving right towards the apple at (8,2) is efficient and avoids the enemy snake.\n\n- The path is clear, and it allows me to pick up another apple at (9,0) afterward.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\n- Continue moving right until reaching (8,3), then move down to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\n- After eating (8,2), move right to (9,2), then down to"

There are apples at (8,2), (5,8), (1,3), (9,0), and (6,5). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (8,2): Row 2, Column 8\n\n- (5,8): Row 8, Column 5\n\n- (1,3): Row 3, Column 1\n\n- (9,0): Row 0, Column 9\n\n- (6,5): Row 5, Column 6\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,6): Row 6, Column 3.\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, I assume multiple snakes are on the board, but only snake #1 is mentioned. I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings of my snake at (4,1).\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n. . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nSo, at column 4, row 1, that's me.\n\nLet's see what's around me:\n\n- Up (increase Y): Row 2, Column 4\n\n- Down (decrease Y): Row 0, Column 4\n\n- Left (decrease X): Row 1, Column 3\n\n- Right (increase X): Row 1, Column 5\n\nLet's check each direction for possible moves.\n\nUp: Row 2, Column 4\n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n. . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 4 in row 2 is empty. Safe to move there.\n\nDown: Row 0, Column 4\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumn 4 in row 0 is empty. Safe.\n\nLeft: Row 1, Column 3\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nColumn 3 in row 1 is empty. Safe.\n\nRight: Row 1, Column 5\n\nRow 1: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nColumn 5 in row 1 is empty. Safe.\n\nSo, all immediate directions are safe for the first move.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go. The goal is to eat apples and score points, while avoiding enemies and not dying.\n\nLet's think about which apple is closest or easiest to reach.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nApples:\n\n- (8,2): Delta X=4, Delta Y=1 \u2192 5 steps (4 right, 1 up)\n\n- (5,8): Delta X=1, Delta Y=7 \u2192 8 steps (1 right, 7 up)\n\n- (1,3): Delta X=3, Delta Y=2 \u2192 5 steps (3 left, 2 up)\n\n- (9,0): Delta X=5, Delta Y=1 \u2192 6 steps (5 right, 1 down)\n\n- (6,5): Delta X=2, Delta Y=4 \u2192 6 steps (2 right, 4 up)\n\nConsidering just the step counts, apples at (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nBut I need to consider the paths and potential dangers.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (8,2) first.\n\nTo get to (8,2), I need to move right 4 steps and up 1 step.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at row 1: columns 5 and 6 are empty (assuming, since not specified).\n\nRow 2: columns 4,5,6,7,8 are empty except for the apple at (8,2).\n\nSo, path seems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy is at (3,6), which is row 6, column 3.\n\nThat's quite far from my path to (8,2). So, probably safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (1,3): left 3 steps and up 2 steps.\n\nRow 1: left 3 steps: columns 1,2,3 are empty.\n\nRow 2: column 1 is empty.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider which one to go for first.\n\nMaybe going for the closer one first is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\nLet's consider the positions:\n\nIf I go to (8,2), then from there, I can consider moving to (5,8), but that's a long way up.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,2), I can look for other apples in the area.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nLet me consider the positions of all apples and plan a path that allows me to eat as many as possible without crossing my own path.\n\nThis sounds like a variant of the traveling salesman problem, but simplified since the graph is a grid and I have to avoid overlapping paths.\n\nBut that's too complex for now. Maybe I can just prioritize the closest apples one by one.\n\nLet me calculate the distances from my current position to each apple, and then from each apple to the next closest apple.\n\nMy current position: (4,1)\n\nDistances to apples:\n\n- (8,2): dx=4, dy=1, steps=5\n\n- (5,8): dx=1, dy=7, steps=8\n\n- (1,3): dx=3, dy=2, steps=5\n\n- (9,0): dx=5, dy=1, steps=6\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=4, steps=6\n\nSo, (8,2) and (1,3) are both 5 steps away.\n\nLet's consider (8,2) first.\n\nFrom (8,2), let's see the distances to other apples:\n\n- (5,8): dx=3, dy=6, steps=9\n\n- (1,3): dx=7, dy=1, steps=8\n\n- (9,0): dx=1, dy=2, steps=3\n\n- (6,5): dx=2, dy=3, steps=5\n\nSo, from (8,2), the closest apple is (9,0) at 3 steps.\n\nThen from (9,0), the closest apple is (6,5) at dx=3, dy=2, steps=5.\n\nThen from (6,5), the closest apple is (5,8) at dx=1, dy=3, steps=4.\n\nFinally, from (5,8), the closest apple is (1,3) at dx=4, dy=5, steps=9.\n\nThis seems like a possible path, but I need to make sure that my growing snake doesn't block my own path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (1,3) first, since it's also 5 steps away.\n\nFrom (1,3), the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,2): dx=7, dy=1, steps=8\n\n- (5,8): dx=4, dy=5, steps=9\n\n- (9,0): dx=8, dy=3, steps=11\n\n- (6,5): dx=5, dy=2, steps=7\n\nSo, from (1,3), the closest apple is (6,5) at 7 steps.\n\nThen from (6,5), closest is (5,8) at 1 step (dx=1, dy=3, steps=4).\n\nThen from (5,8), closest is (8,2) at 4 steps.\n\nThen from (8,2), closest is (9,0) at 1 step.\n\nThis seems another possible path.\n\nBut considering the first path I thought of, going to (8,2), then (9,0), then (6,5), then (5,8), then (1,3), seems shorter in terms of total steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that as I grow, I don't block my own path.\n\nWait, every time I eat an apple, my snake grows, so I need to"

Wait, but my snake is at (4,2), so there might be a mistake in interpreting the positions.\n\nWait, actually, in the board state provided, snake #2 is at (4,2), but in the initial information, it says snake #2 is at (4,1). There seems to be inconsistency here.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\nDirection: UP\n\nRationale: ...\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nWait, in the last move information, it says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (4,1)\", but in the board state, snake #2 is at (4,1). But in the \"Board state\" section, it shows snake #2 at position (4,1), which is row 1, column 4.\n\nWait, but in the last move information, it says \"Your last move information: Direction: UP\", meaning you moved up from some previous position to (4,1).\n\nBut in the board state, snake #2 is at (4,1), and enemy snake #1 is at (4,6).\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between rows and columns.\n\nIn the board state, positions are given as (row, column), so (4,1) means row 4, column 1.\n\nBut in the coordinate system, it's (column, row), with (0,0) at the bottom left.\n\nWait, no, in the initial information, it says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nBut in the board state, it's shown with row numbers increasing upwards, and columns from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nSo, position (4,2) would be column 4, row 2.\n\nWait, but in the board state, snake #2 is at (4,1), which is column 4, row 1.\n\nI need to clarify this to avoid confusion.\n\nAssuming that the board state is correct, and snake #2 is at (4,1), I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, snake #2 at (4,1), which is column 4, row 1.\n\nNow, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (4,2)\n\n- Down: to (4,0)\n\n- Left: to (3,1)\n\n- Right: to (5,1)\n\nLet's check each direction for safety and potential apple consumption.\n\nUp: (4,2)\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, column 4 in row 2 is empty. Safe to move there. No apple there immediately, but there's an apple at (8,2), which is column 8, row 2.\n\nDown: (4,0)\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . .

Need to see if moving down gets me closer to any apple.\n\n- Moving down to (3,1), then possibly left or right.\n\n**Left: (2,2)**\n\n- Check row 2, column 2:\n\n- From the board, row 2: . . . 2 . . . .

It's still below me, so I don't think it's a concern for now.\n\nMy strategy for now is still to focus on getting the closest apple and growing my snake.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (3,3), and I need to choose between moving up, down, left, or right. There are apples at (8,2), (5,8), (1,3), (9,0), and (6,5). Also, there's an enemy snake at (6,6).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest.\n\nLet me look at the distances to each apple from my current position (3,3):\n\n- To (8,2): I need to move right 5 times and down 1 time. That's a total of 6 moves.\n\n- To (5,8): That's right 2 times and up 5 times. That's 7 moves.\n\n- To (1,3): Left 2 times. Just 2 moves.\n\n- To (9,0): Right 6 times and down 3 times. That's 9 moves.\n\n- To (6,5): Right 3 times and up 2 times. That's 5 moves.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,3), only 2 moves away. But I should also consider if there are any obstacles or if it's safe to go there.\n\nLooking at the board, if I move left to (2,3), then left again to (1,3), that seems straightforward. No enemy snakes in that area as far as I can tell.\n\nBut, I should also think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating (1,3), the next closest apple would be (6,5), which is right 5 times and up 2 times. That's 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (6,5) directly from (3,3), it's only 3 rights and 2 ups, totaling 5 moves. That might be more efficient.\n\nWait, but (1,3) is closer at only 2 moves. So, maybe I should go for (1,3) first, eat it, and then head to (6,5).\n\nLet me think about the points. Each apple gives me one point, so the more apples I can eat, the better. But I also need to make sure I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the enemy snake's position at (6,6). If I go towards (6,5), which is adjacent to the enemy, I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nMaybe it's safer to go for (1,3) first, since it's farther away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (8,2), which is right 5 times and up 1 time, totaling 6 moves. After eating that, I can go to (9,0), which is just down 2 times from there.\n\nSo, let's compare the two strategies:\n\nStrategy A:\n\n1. Go to (1,3): 2 moves\n\n2. Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n3. Go to (6,5): right 5 times, up 2 times = 7 moves\n\n4. Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n5. Go to another apple\n\nTotal moves: 2 + 7 = 9 moves for 2 apples\n\nStrategy B:\n\n1. Go to (8,2): right 5 times, up 1 time = 6 moves\n\n2. Eat apple, grow by 1\n\n3. Go to (9,0): right 1 time, down 2 times = 3 moves\n\n4. Eat apple, grow by 1\n\nTotal moves: 6 + 3 = 9 moves for 2 apples\n\nSo, both strategies take the same number of moves for 2 apples. But in Strategy A, after eating (1,3), I have to traverse a longer distance to (6,5), while in Strategy B, after eating (8,2), I can quickly go to (9,0).\n\nAdditionally, in Strategy A, I'm moving towards the enemy snake, which might be risky, while in Strategy B, I'm moving away from it.\n\nTherefore, Strategy B seems safer and more efficient.\n\nLet me also consider the apple at (5,8). That's right 2 times and up 5 times, totaling 7 moves. That's longer than going to (8,2), so it's probably not the best choice right now.\n\nSo, my plan is to go to (8,2) first, then to (9,0), and then see what's next.\n\nNow, for my immediate move, since I'm at (3,3), I need to start moving right towards (8,2).\n\nBut before I do that, I should check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- Right to (4,3): empty\n\n- Right to (5,3): empty\n\n- Right to (6,3): empty\n\n- Right to (7,3): empty\n\n- Right to (8,3): empty\n\nThen, up to (8,2): one move up.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (8,2), which is left from (8,3). Wait, no: coordinates are (x,y), so (8,2) is column 8, row 2, which is down from (8,3).\n\nWait, in this game, higher Y is up, so (8,2) is actually down from (8,3).\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nGiven that row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row, then higher Y is up.\n\nSo, from (8,3), to (8,2) is down.\n\nBut in the board, row numbers increase upwards, so row 0 is bottom, row 9 is top.\n\nTherefore, moving from (8,3) to (8,2) is moving down.\n\nSo, to reach (8,2) from (3,3), I need to move right 5 times to reach (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to the right.\n\nBut wait, I'm at (3,3). If I move right to (4,3), then right to (5,3), and so on, up to (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nBut in my initial thought, I thought of moving right to (8,3), then up to (8,2), but that's incorrect because (8,2) is down from (8,3).\n\nSo, I need to make sure I'm moving in the right direction.\n\nWait, no, (8,2) is down from (8,3), since higher Y is up.\n\nSo, from (8,3), to (8,2) is down.\n\nTherefore, from (3,3), I need to move right 5 times to (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nGot it.\n\nNow, considering that, I need to make a series of right moves to reach (8,3), then down to (8,2).\n\nBut for my immediate next move, I should just move right.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that moving right is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, there are no obstacles in the path from (3,3) to (8,3). It's all open.\n\nAfter reaching (8,3), I can then move down to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I can then move right to (9,2), then down to (9,1), then down to (9,0) to eat another apple.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (8,2), I could consider going to (6,5), but (9,0) is closer, being just down 2 and right 1.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), to (9,0), it's right 1, down 2.\n\nWait, no, from (8,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,1), then down to (9,0).\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nTo (6,5), from (8,2), it's left 2, up 3, which is 5 moves.\n\nSo, (9,0) is closer after eating (8,2).\n\nTherefore, sticking with Strategy B seems better.\n\nNow, to execute this, I need to start moving right towards (8,2).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to the right.\n\nBut, I should also consider if there's any immediate threat from the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,6), which is up and to the right from my current position.\n\nBut, I'm planning to move right, away from the enemy.\n\nTherefore, moving right seems safe.\n\nMoreover, moving right doesn't bring me closer to any walls or other snakes.\n\nHence, my decision is to move right.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving right towards the apple at (8,2) is efficient and avoids the enemy snake.\n\n- The path is clear, and it allows me to pick up another apple at (9,0) afterward.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\n- Continue moving right until reaching (8,3), then move down to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\n- After eating (8,2), move right to (9,2), then down to"

Also, there's an enemy snake at (6,5) with its body at (6,6).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.

No enemy snakes in that area as far as I can tell.\n\nBut, I should also think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating (1,3), the next closest apple would be (3,6), which is right 2 times and up 3 times. That's 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go directly to (3,6) from (3,2), it's just up 4 times. That's 4 moves.\n\nWait, but (1,3) is closer at 3 moves, while (3,6) is 4 moves. So, maybe I should go for (1,3) first, eat it, and then head to (3,6).\n\nLet me think about the points.

If I go towards (3,6), which is above my current position, I might be able to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the apple at (8,2), which is right 5 times. That's 5 moves. After eating that, I can go to (9,0), which is down 2 times from there.\n\nWait, but (9,0) is down from (9,2), so after eating (8,2), I'd need to move right to (9,2), then down to (9,1), and then down to (9,0). That's 3 more moves.\n\nSo, going to (1,3) (3 moves), then to (3,6) (5 moves), total 8 moves for 2 apples.\n\nGoing to (8,2) (5 moves), then to (9,0) (3 moves), total 8 moves for 2 apples.\n\nSimilar in terms of moves, but going to (1,3) first avoids the enemy snake, while going to (8,2) takes me closer to the enemy.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,3), I can grow and have a longer body, which might help me in future moves.\n\nAlso, looking at the board, moving left to (2,2), then (1,2), and (1,3) seems safe. No enemy snakes in that area.\n\nAfter eating (1,3), I can then move right to (2,3), then (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3), then up to (6,4), (6,5). Wait, but (6,5) is where the enemy snake is.\n\nSo, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake.\n\nPerhaps, after eating (1,3), I should aim for (3,6) by moving right to (2,3), then (3,3), then up to (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6).\n\nThat way, I avoid the enemy snake's position at (6,5).\n\nThis seems safer.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), I can then consider going for another apple.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (8,2), (5,8), and (9,0).\n\nFrom (3,6), moving to (8,2) would require right 5 times and down 4 times, which is 9 moves.\n\nMoving to (5,8) would be right 2 times and up 2 times, which is 4 moves.\n\nMoving to (9,0) would be right 6 times and down 6 times, which is 12 moves.\n\nSo, (5,8) is the closest option from (3,6), at 4 moves.\n\nAfter eating (5,8), I can then consider going to (8,2) or (9,0).\n\nFrom (5,8), to (8,2): right 3 times, down 6 times, total 9 moves.\n\nTo (9,0): right 4 times, down 8 times, total 12 moves.\n\nTo (9,0), it's better to go via (8,2) first.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,8), going to (9,0) directly: right 4 times, down 8 times.\n\nBut that's a long path, and I might be exposing myself to the enemy snake.\n\nSo, perhaps after (5,8), I should go to (8,2), which is right 3, down 6, total 9 moves.\n\nThen, from (8,2), go to (9,0): right 1, down 2, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, total moves:\n\n- To (1,3): 3 moves\n\n- To (3,6): 5 moves\n\n- To (5,8): 4 moves\n\n- To (8,2): 9 moves\n\n- To (9,0): 3 moves\n\nTotal: 3 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 3 = 24 moves for 5 apples.\n\nAlternatively, another path:\n\n- To (8,2): 5 moves\n\n- To (9,0): 3 moves\n\n- To (5,8): 7 moves (left 4, up 8)\n\n- To (1,3): 7 moves (left 8, down 1)\n\n- To (3,6): 4 moves (right 2, up 3)\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 4 = 26 moves for 5 apples.\n\nSo, the first strategy is better in terms of total moves.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy snake's movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake is stationary or moving in a predictable pattern, but since I don't have information about its movement, I need to assume it could move towards me.\n\nTherefore, it's safer to avoid areas with the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, going to (1,3) first, then to (3,6), then to (5,8), then to (8,2), and finally to (9,0) seems like a safer and more efficient path.\n\nNow, for my immediate move, since I'm at (3,2), and I want to go to (1,3), I need to move left to (2,2), then left to (1,2), then up to (1,3).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be to the left.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, from (3,2), moving left to (2,2): is that position empty?\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, position (2,2) is empty.\n\nThen, moving left to (1,2): again, empty.\n\nThen, up to (1,3): also empty.\n\nNo enemy snakes in that path.\n\nTherefore, moving left is safe.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,3), I can then move right to (2,3), then (3,3), then (4,3), etc., up to (3,6).\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move left.\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Moving left towards the closest apple at (1,3) is the most efficient initial move.\n\n- This path avoids the enemy snake and ensures safety.\n\n- After eating (1,3), I can proceed to (3,6), then to (5,8), and so on, minimizing total movement.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\n- Continue moving left to (2,2), then to (1,2), and up to (1,3) to eat the apple.\n\n- Then, move right towards (3,3) and up to (3,6) to eat the next apple, avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"
