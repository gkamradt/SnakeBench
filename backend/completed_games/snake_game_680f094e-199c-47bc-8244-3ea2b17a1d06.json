If moving directly toward an apple puts me too close to another snake, calculate the shortest path to the next closest apple, prioritizing horizontal or vertical moves.  Record enemy positions and movement to predict where they will be and avoid collisions. Maintain a safety margin. Look for apples and calculate the shortest path to them in the next turn. Maintain a clear path and don't be too aggressive.  Also, start to calculate the manhattan distance to all apples. Remember my body and enemy bodies.\n\n\nNext move: DOWN"
