            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The apples are located at (0,1), (0,8), (9,4), (4,0), and (9,6). There's another snake, ID 1, at (1,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see the positions of the apples and the other snake. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The apples are spread out, but the closest one to me is at (9,6), which is to the right and a bit down. Another apple is at (9,4), which is further down. There's also an apple at (0,8), which is near the top left, and (0,1) near the bottom left, and (4,0) near the bottom middle.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The apple at (9,6) is the closest in terms of movement from (6,7). To get there, I can move right three times and down two times. Alternatively, the apple at (9,4) would require moving right three times and down four times, which is a bit further. The other apples are much further away, so maybe I should focus on the closest ones first.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,0), which is near the bottom left. Since its body is empty, it's just the head there, so it's not blocking me right now. But I should be cautious about where it might move next.\n\nMy current position is (6,7). If I move right, I go towards (7,7), which is still in the middle. If I move down, I go to (6,6), which is closer to the apple at (9,6). Alternatively, moving up would take me to (6,8), which is near the top, but there's an apple at (0,8), but that's far away. Moving left would take me to (5,7), which is away from the apples.\n\nSo, considering the closest apple, moving towards (9,6) seems like a good idea. Let me plan the path. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7), then (8,7), then (9,7). But the apple is at (9,6), so I need to move down from (9,7) to (9,6). That would be a total of three rights and one down. Alternatively, I could move down first to (6,6), then right three times to (9,6). Either way, I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, but moving down from (6,7) to (6,6) is possible, but I should check if that's safe. The enemy snake is at (1,0), so it's not in that area. Also, I need to make sure I don't collide with myself. Since my body is not specified, I can assume it's just the head at (6,7) unless I've moved before. But since the last move info is None, maybe I just moved there or it's my starting position.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,6) seems safe. Then, from there, moving right three times to (9,6) to eat the apple. That would give me a point and make me grow. Alternatively, moving right first might be better to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move right first, I can get to (9,7) and then down to (9,6). That might be a better path because it's more direct. Let me visualize the grid:\n\nCurrent position: (6,7)\nIf I move right to (7,7), then (8,7), then (9,7), then down to (9,6). That's four moves, but I can only make one move at a time. So, the next move should be towards that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,6), then right three times. But which direction is better? Maybe moving right first to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the enemy snake might block me. Since it's at (1,0), it's not in the way. So, I can safely move towards the apple.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,6) is in the top right, but there's also an apple at (9,4). Maybe I should prioritize the higher y-coordinate apple first because it's closer.\n\nWait, no, (9,6) is at y=6, which is higher than (9,4) at y=4. So, (9,6) is actually higher up, which is closer in terms of y-coordinate from my current position at y=7.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,6) is one step towards (9,6). Alternatively, moving right to (7,7) is also a step towards the apple, but it's more towards the right.\n\nHmm, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly towards the apple's x-coordinate. Let me think about the grid again.\n\nFrom (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is one step towards the apple at (9,6). Then, from (7,7), moving right again to (8,7), then to (9,7), and then down to (9,6). That's four moves, but I can only make one move now.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,6), then right three times. But which is better? Maybe moving right first because it's closer to the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), so I need to get to x=9 and y=6. So, moving right increases x, and moving down decreases y. From (6,7), moving right increases x towards 9, and moving down decreases y towards 6.\n\nSo, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly increasing x, which is part of the target. Alternatively, moving down also helps, but maybe moving right is more efficient.\n\nWait, but if I move right, I can get closer to the apple's x-coordinate, but I'm moving away from the y-coordinate. Hmm, maybe a balance is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the Manhattan distance. The distance to (9,6) from (6,7) is |9-6| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4. So, four moves in total. If I move right, I reduce the x distance by 1, but increase the y distance by 1. If I move down, I reduce the y distance by 1, but increase the x distance by 0.\n\nWait, no, moving right from (6,7) to (7,7) reduces the x distance by 1 (from 3 to 2), but the y distance remains 1 (from 7 to 6). So, moving right is better because it reduces the x distance.\n\nAlternatively, moving down from (6,7) to (6,6) reduces the y distance by 1 (from 1 to 0), but the x distance remains 3. So, moving right seems better because it reduces the x distance, which is larger.\n\nWait, but the Manhattan distance is the sum of the x and y distances. So, moving right reduces the x distance, which is more significant. So, perhaps moving right is better.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just move right to start heading towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the shortest path. From (6,7), moving right three times and down once would get me to (9,6). So, the next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (1,0), so it's not in that area. Also, I need to make sure I don't collide with myself. Since my body is not specified, I can assume it's just the head, so moving right is safe.\n\nSo, perhaps moving right is the best move. It gets me closer to the apple at (9,6) and doesn't put me in any danger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. The apple at (0,8) is at the top left, but that's far away. The apple at (4,0) is near the bottom middle. The apple at (0,1) is near the bottom left. The apple at (9,4) is further down.\n\nBut since I'm at (6,7), the closest apple is (9,6). So, focusing on that makes sense.\n\nWait, but if I move right, I might be getting closer to the edge of the board. The board is 10x10, so moving right from (6,7) to (7,7) is still within the board. The maximum x is 9, so I have room to move right.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move right, will I be in a position where the enemy snake can block me? Since the enemy is at (1,0), it's not in the same area, so probably not.\n\nSo, after thinking through all this, I think moving right is the best next move. It gets me closer to the apple at (9,6) and doesn't put me in any immediate danger.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move RIGHT towards the apple at (9,6), which is the closest and most accessible apple. This strategy aims to maximize points by efficiently moving towards the nearest apple without risking collision.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The apples are located at (0,1), (0,8), (9,4), (4,0), and (9,6). There's another snake, ID 1, at (1,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see the positions of the apples and the other snake. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The apples are spread out, but the closest one to me is at (9,6), which is to the right and a bit down. Another apple is at (9,4), which is further down. There's also an apple at (0,8), which is near the top left, and (0,1) near the bottom left, and (4,0) near the bottom middle.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The apple at (9,6) is the closest in terms of movement from (6,7). To get there, I can move right three times and down two times. Alternatively, the apple at (9,4) would require moving right three times and down four times, which is a bit further. The other apples are much further away, so maybe I should focus on the closest ones first.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,0), which is near the bottom left. Since its body is empty, it's just the head there, so it's not blocking me right now. But I should be cautious about where it might move next.\n\nMy current position is (6,7). If I move right, I go towards (7,7), which is still in the middle. If I move down, I go to (6,6), which is closer to the apple at (9,6). Alternatively, moving up would take me to (6,8), which is near the top, but there's an apple at (0,8), but that's far away. Moving left would take me to (5,7), which is away from the apples.\n\nSo, considering the closest apple, moving towards (9,6) seems like a good idea. Let me plan the path. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7), then (8,7), then (9,7). But the apple is at (9,6), so I need to move down from (9,7) to (9,6). That would be a total of three rights and one down. Alternatively, I could move down first to (6,6), then right three times to (9,6). Either way, I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, but moving down from (6,7) to (6,6) is possible, but I should check if that's safe. The enemy snake is at (1,0), so it's not in that area. Also, I need to make sure I don't collide with myself. Since my body is not specified, I can assume it's just the head there unless I've moved before. But since the last move info is None, maybe I just moved there or it's my starting position.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,6) seems safe. Then, from there, moving right three times to (9,6) to eat the apple. That would give me a point and make me grow. Alternatively, moving right first might be better to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move right first, I can get to (9,7) and then down to (9,6). That might be a better path because it's more direct. Let me visualize the grid:\n\nCurrent position: (6,7)\nIf I move right to (7,7), then (8,7), then (9,7), then down to (9,6). That's four moves, but I can only make one move at a time. So, the next move should be towards that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,6), then right three times. But which direction is better? Maybe moving right first to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the enemy snake might block me. Since it's at (1,0), it's not in the way. So, I can safely move towards the apple.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,6) is in the top right, but there's also an apple at (9,4). Maybe I should prioritize the higher y-coordinate apple first because it's closer in terms of y-coordinate from my current position at y=7.\n\nWait, no, (9,6) is at y=6, which is higher than (9,4) at y=4. So, (9,6) is actually higher up, which is closer in terms of y-coordinate from my current position at y=7.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,6) is one step towards (9,6). Alternatively, moving right first to (7,7) is also a step towards the apple, but it's more towards the right.\n\nHmm, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly towards the apple's x-coordinate. Let me think about the grid again.\n\nFrom (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is one step towards the apple at (9,6). Then, from (7,7), moving right again to (8,7), then to (9,7), and then down to (9,6). That's four moves, but I can only make one move now.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,6), then right three times. But which is better? Maybe moving right first because it's directly towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), so I need to get to x=9 and y=6. So, moving right increases x, and moving down decreases y. From (6,7), moving right increases x towards 9, and moving down decreases y towards 6.\n\nSo, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly increasing x, which is part of the target. Alternatively, moving down first to (6,6) reduces the y distance.\n\nWait, but the Manhattan distance is the sum of the x and y distances. The distance to (9,6) from (6,7) is |9-6| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4. So, four moves in total. If I move right, I reduce the x distance by 1 (from 3 to 2), but the y distance remains 1 (from 7 to 6). If I move down, I reduce the y distance by 1 (from 1 to 0), but the x distance remains 3.\n\nSo, moving right seems better because it reduces the x distance, which is larger. Alternatively, moving down reduces the y distance, which is smaller.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just move right to start heading towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the shortest path. From (6,7), moving right three times and down once would get me to (9,6). So, the next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (1,0), so it's not in that area. Also, I need to make sure I don't collide with myself. Since my body is not specified, I can assume it's just the head, so moving right is safe.\n\nSo, after thinking through all this, I think moving right is the best next move. It gets me closer to the apple at (9,6) and doesn't put me in any immediate danger.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

The maximum x is 9, so I have room to move right.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move right, will I be in a position where the enemy snake can block me? Since the enemy is at (1,0), it's not in the same area, so probably not.\n\nSo, after thinking through all this, I think moving right is the best next move.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The apples are located at (0,1), (0,8), (9,4), (4,0), and (9,6). There's another snake, ID 1, at (1,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see the positions of the apples and the other snake. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The apples are spread out, but the closest one to me is at (9,6), which is to the right and a bit down. Another apple is at (9,4), which is further down. There's also an apple at (0,8), which is near the top left, and (0,1) near the bottom left, and (4,0) near the bottom middle.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The apple at (9,6) is the closest in terms of movement from (6,7). To get there, I can move right three times and down two times. Alternatively, the apple at (9,4) would require moving right three times and down four times, which is a bit further. The other apples are much further away, so maybe I should focus on the closest ones first.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,0), which is near the bottom left. Since its body is empty, it's just the head there, so it's not blocking me right now. But I should be cautious about where it might move next.\n\nMy current position is (6,7). If I move right, I go towards (7,7), which is still in the middle. If I move down, I go to (6,6), which is closer to the apple at (9,6). Alternatively, moving up would take me to (6,8), which is near the top, but there's an apple at (0,8), but that's far away. Moving left would take me to (5,7), which is away from the apples.\n\nSo, considering the closest apple, moving towards (9,6) seems like a good idea. Let me plan the path. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7), then (8,7), then (9,7). But the apple is at (9,6), so I need to move down from (9,7) to (9,6). That would be a total of three rights and one down. Alternatively, I could move down first to (6,6), then right three times to (9,6). Either way, I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, but moving down from (6,7) to (6,6) is possible, but I should check if that's safe. The enemy snake is at (1,0), so it's not in that area. Also, I need to make sure I don't collide with myself. Since my body is not specified, I can assume it's just the head there unless I've moved before. But since the last move info is None, maybe I just moved there or it's my starting position.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,6) seems safe. Then, from there, moving right three times to (9,6) to eat the apple. That would give me a point and make me grow. Alternatively, moving right first might be better to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move right first, I can get to (9,7) and then down to (9,6). That might be a better path because it's more direct. Let me visualize the grid:\n\nCurrent position: (6,7)\nIf I move right to (7,7), then (8,7), then (9,7), then down to (9,6). That's four moves, but I can only make one move at a time. So, the next move should be towards that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,6), then right three times. But which direction is better? Maybe moving right first to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the enemy snake might block me. Since it's at (1,0), it's not in the way. So, I can safely move towards the apple.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,6) is in the top right, but there's also an apple at (9,4). Maybe I should prioritize the higher y-coordinate apple first because it's closer in terms of y-coordinate from my current position at y=7.\n\nWait, no, (9,6) is at y=6, which is higher than (9,4) at y=4. So, (9,6) is actually higher up, which is closer in terms of y-coordinate from my current position at y=7.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,6) is one step towards (9,6). Alternatively, moving right first to (7,7) is also a step towards the apple, but it's more towards the right.\n\nHmm, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly towards the apple's x-coordinate. Let me think about the grid again.\n\nFrom (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is one step towards the apple at (9,6). Then, from (7,7), moving right again to (8,7), then to (9,7), and then down to (9,6). That's four moves, but I can only make one move now.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,6), then right three times. But which is better? Maybe moving right first because it's directly towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), so I need to get to x=9 and y=6. So, moving right increases x, and moving down decreases y. From (6,7), moving right increases x towards 9, and moving down decreases y towards 6.\n\nSo, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly increasing x, which is part of the target. Alternatively, moving down first to (6,6) reduces the y distance.\n\nWait, but the Manhattan distance is the sum of the x and y distances. The distance to (9,6) from (6,7) is |9-6| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4. So, four moves in total. If I move right, I reduce the x distance by 1 (from 3 to 2), but the y distance remains 1 (from 7 to 6). If I move down, I reduce the y distance by 1 (from 1 to 0), but the x distance remains 3.\n\nSo, moving right seems better because it reduces the x distance, which is larger. Alternatively, moving down first reduces the y distance, which is smaller.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just move right to start heading towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the shortest path. From (6,7), moving right three times and down once would get me to (9,6). So, the next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles?

It gets me closer to the apple at (9,6) and doesn't put me in any immediate danger.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**\n</think>\n\nThe next move for the snake is to move RIGHT towards the apple at (9,6), which is the closest and most accessible apple. This move is safe and strategically advantageous.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

So, focusing on that makes sense.\n\nWait, but if I move right, I might be getting closer to the edge of the board. The board is 10x10, so moving right from (6,7) to (7,7) is still within the board. The maximum x is 9, so I have room to move right.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move right, will I be in a position where the enemy snake can block me? Since the enemy is at (1,0), it's not in the same area, so probably not.\n\nSo, after thinking through all this, I think moving right is the best next move.

So, moving right increases x, and moving down decreases y. From (6,7), moving right increases x towards 9, and moving down decreases y towards 6.\n\nSo, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly increasing x, which is part of the target. Alternatively, moving down first to (6,6) reduces the y distance.\n\nWait, but the Manhattan distance is the sum of the x and y distances. The distance to (9,6) from (6,7) is |9-6| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4. So, four moves in total. If I move right, I reduce the x distance by 1 (from 3 to 2), but the y distance remains 1 (from 7 to 6). If I move down, I reduce the y distance by 1 (from 1 to 0), but the x distance remains 3.\n\nSo, moving right seems better because it reduces the x distance, which is larger. Alternatively, moving down reduces the y distance, which is smaller.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just move right to start heading towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the shortest path. From (6,7), moving right three times and down once would get me to (9,6). So, the next move should be right.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (1,0), so it's not in that area. Also, I need to make sure I don't collide with myself. Since my body is not specified, I can assume it's just the head, so moving right is safe.\n\nSo, after thinking through all this, I think moving right is the best next move. It gets me closer to the apple at (9,6) and doesn't put me in any immediate danger.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The apples are located at (0,1), (0,8), (9,4), (4,0), and (9,6). There's another snake, ID 1, at (1,0) with an empty body, so it's just the head there.\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see the positions of the apples and the other snake. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The apples are spread out, but the closest one to me is at (9,6), which is to the right and a bit down. Another apple is at (9,4), which is further down. There's also an apple at (0,8), which is near the top left, and (0,1) near the bottom left, and (4,0) near the bottom middle.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. The apple at (9,6) is the closest in terms of movement from (6,7). To get there, I can move right three times and down two times. Alternatively, the apple at (9,4) would require moving right three times and down four times, which is a bit further. The other apples are much further away, so maybe I should focus on the closest ones first.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,0), which is near the bottom left. Since its body is empty, it's just the head there, so it's not blocking me right now. But I should be cautious about where it might move next.\n\nMy current position is (6,7). If I move right, I go towards (7,7), which is still in the middle. If I move down, I go to (6,6), which is closer to the apple at (9,6). Alternatively, moving up would take me to (6,8), which is near the top, but there's an apple at (0,8), but that's far away. Moving left would take me to (5,7), which is away from the apples.\n\nSo, considering the closest apple, moving towards (9,6) seems like a good idea. Let me plan the path. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7), then (8,7), then (9,7). But the apple is at (9,6), so I need to move down from (9,7) to (9,6). That would be a total of three rights and one down. Alternatively, I could move down first to (6,6), then right three times to (9,6). Either way, I need to make sure I don't run into any walls or the enemy snake.\n\nWait, but moving down from (6,7) to (6,6) is possible, but I should check if that's safe. The enemy snake is at (1,0), so it's not in that area. Also, I need to make sure I don't collide with myself. Since my body is not specified, I can assume it's just the head there unless I've moved before. But since the last move info is None, maybe I just moved there or it's my starting position.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,6) seems safe. Then, from there, moving right three times to (9,6) to eat the apple. That would give me a point and make me grow. Alternatively, moving right first might be better to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but if I move right first, I can get to (9,7) and then down to (9,6). That might be a better path because it's more direct. Let me visualize the grid:\n\nCurrent position: (6,7)\nIf I move right to (7,7), then (8,7), then (9,7), then down to (9,6). That's four moves, but I can only make one move at a time. So, the next move should be towards that path.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,6), then right three times. But which direction is better? Maybe moving right first to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the enemy snake might block me. Since it's at (1,0), it's not in the way. So, I can safely move towards the apple.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,6) is in the top right, but there's also an apple at (9,4). Maybe I should prioritize the higher y-coordinate apple first because it's closer in terms of y-coordinate from my current position at y=7.\n\nWait, no, (9,6) is at y=6, which is higher than (9,4) at y=4. So, (9,6) is actually higher up, which is closer in terms of y-coordinate from my current position at y=7.\n\nSo, moving down to (6,6) is one step towards (9,6). Alternatively, moving right first to (7,7) is also a step towards the apple, but it's more towards the right.\n\nHmm, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly towards the apple's x-coordinate. Let me think about the grid again.\n\nFrom (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is one step towards the apple at (9,6). Then, from (7,7), moving right again to (8,7), then to (9,7), and then down to (9,6). That's four moves, but I can only make one move now.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (6,6), then right three times. But which is better? Maybe moving right first because it's directly towards the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nWait, but the apple is at (9,6), so I need to get to x=9 and y=6. So, moving right increases x, and moving down decreases y. From (6,7), moving right increases x towards 9, and moving down decreases y towards 6.\n\nSo, perhaps moving right is better because it's directly increasing x, which is part of the target. Alternatively, moving down first to (6,6) reduces the y distance.\n\nWait, but the Manhattan distance is the sum of the x and y distances.

It gets me closer to the apple at (9,6) and doesn't put me in any immediate danger.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**\n</think>\n\nThe next move for the snake is to move RIGHT towards the apple at (9,6), which is the closest and most accessible apple. This move is safe and strategically advantageous.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

It\u2019s crucial to monitor its growth and position in subsequent turns.\n    \n**Strategy Analysis:**\n  - Initially continuing right might be a recommended action to set up for the apple at (5, 4).
