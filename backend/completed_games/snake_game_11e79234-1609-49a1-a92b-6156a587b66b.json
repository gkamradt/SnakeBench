Moving left to (4, 7) and then to (3, 7) could allow me to collect it on the next turn.\n   - The other apples are significantly farther away and not in a direct line or easy path to collect next turn.\n   - Since there are no immediate threats (walls or other snakes) in the positions I can move to, it's safe to consider heading toward the apple.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best move appears to be LEFT to (4, 7), towards the apple at (3, 7).\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

Going right or left would be pointless.\nGoing up is the only safe move.\n\nNext turn, I will re-evaluate the board state and decide on the best direction to get an apple, while avoiding the other snake and the walls.\n\nUP"
