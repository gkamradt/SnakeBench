I'm also 2 units away from the apple at (2, 9) and 4 units down. The closest apple is still at (2, 9), but I'm not sure if I can get there safely.\n\nSince I'm moving down, I'll continue in this direction to get closer to the apple at (4, 4). I'll move DOWN again to get one step closer to the apple.\n\nNext, I'll move... DOWN.\n\n(Note to self: Keep an eye on Snake #1 and be prepared to change direction if necessary. Also, consider moving LEFT after reaching the row with the apple to get closer to it.)"
