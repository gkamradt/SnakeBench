This is within the board. **Valid move.**\n2. **DOWN:** (5, 6) \u2192 (5, 5). This is within the board, but it would lead to a collision with the enemy snake at (5, 5). **Invalid move.**\n3. **LEFT:** (5, 6) \u2192 (4, 6). This is within the board. **Valid move.**\n4. **RIGHT:** (5, 6) \u2192 (6, 6). This is within the board. **Valid move.**\n\n### Potential Paths:\n- **UP to (5, 7):** Positions me closer to the apple at (5, 9).\n- **LEFT to (4, 6):** Moves me away from the enemy snake but doesn\u2019t position me closer to any apples.\n- **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Positions me closer to the apple at (7, 2) and (9, 5).\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Goal:** Position myself to potentially grab multiple apples in the future.\n- **Secondary Goal:** Avoid collisions with the enemy snake and walls.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving **UP** to (5, 7) seems like a good option because:\n- It positions me closer to the apple at (5, 9).\n- It avoids moving towards the enemy snake at (5, 5).\n\nNext turn, I can plan to move **UP** again towards (5, 8), eventually aiming for the apple at (5, 9).\n\n**Next Move:** UP\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:** After moving UP to (5, 7), consider moving UP again towards (5, 8) to position myself closer to the apple at (5, 9).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** UP"

I still don't see any immediate threats from Snake #1, so I'll stick to my plan.\n\nHowever, I notice that Snake #1 is getting closer to me, and I need to be careful not to get trapped. I'll keep moving up towards the apple at (5, 9) and be prepared to adjust if Snake #1 gets too close.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep moving up towards the apple at (5, 9) and be prepared to adjust if Snake #1 gets too close. If Snake #1 moves down, I might need to move right to avoid it.\n\nNext move: UP"
