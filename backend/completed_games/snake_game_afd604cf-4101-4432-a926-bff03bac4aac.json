My previous move was to the left, which was a good decision to get away from the enemy snake at (2, 6). Now, I need to decide whether to continue moving left or start moving up towards the apple.\n\nI notice that the enemy snake is still at (2, 6) with its body at [(3, 6)], so I don't want to move up just yet. If I move left again, I'll be getting closer to the apple at (0, 7) and also keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nHowever, I also notice that there's an apple at (1, 0) which is closer to me than the apple at (0, 7). If I move left again, I'll be getting closer to this apple as well. Maybe I should prioritize this apple instead?\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and be prepared to adjust my path accordingly. If the coast is clear, I'll continue moving towards the apple at (1, 0) for now.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
