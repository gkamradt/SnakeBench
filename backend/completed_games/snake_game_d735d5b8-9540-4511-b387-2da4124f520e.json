Subsequently, the snake can explore other sections of the board, targeting remaining apples while avoiding enemy positions and obstacles.\n\n**Decided move:** **LEFT**"

            "rationale": "Okay, let's think this through carefully.\n\nThe closest apple is at (0, 6), so moving left to grab it would be a safe choice. This would put some distance between me and the enemy snake, which is a good strategy.\n\nAnother option would be to move towards the apple at (1, 1), which is a bit closer. However, this would put me in closer proximity to the enemy snake, so it might be riskier.\n\nUltimately, I think my best strategy here is to play it safe and move LEFT towards the apple at (0, 6). This will keep me away from the enemy snake while still allowing me to gain some points.\n\nMy next move is: LEFT.\n\nFor my next turn, I should consider moving up towards the apple at (1, 8). This would put me in a better position to collect more apples and potentially gain an advantage over the enemy snake."
