The nearest apple is still (4, 5) and I'm one step closer to it. I need to move up twice and then right four times to reach it.\n\nNow that I've moved away from Snake #1, I can consider collecting the apple at (4, 5). However, I should also consider the positions of other snakes and apples on the board. Snake #1 is moving upwards, so if I collect the apple at (4, 5), I will cross its path. I should prioritize avoiding Snake #1.\n\nTo avoid Snake #1, I can move up and then right. This will take me closer to the apple at (6, 8) and further away from Snake #1. I can reassess the situation after moving up and determine whether it's safe to collect the apple at (4, 5) or if I should target a different apple.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Move up and then reassess the situation to determine the next apple to target.\n\nNext move: UP."
