            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (3,9). There are apples at (2,9), (6,7), (2,5), (1,0), and (0,0). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board layout to get a sense of where everything is. Let's visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . A 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 5: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: A A . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, at row 9, column 3, that's where I am. There's an apple at (2,9), which is left of me. Another apple at (6,7), which is diagonally down and to the right. There's another at (2,5), which is down quite a bit and to the left. And there are apples at (1,0) and (0,0), which are all the way down at the bottom left.\n\nI also need to be aware of the enemy snake, snake #1, which is at (8,6), and it has no body parts listed, so it's probably just its head.\n\nMy main goal is to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Each time I eat an apple, I grow longer, which is both good and bad\u2014good because I gain points, but bad because my snake is longer and more likely to collide with itself.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (2,9), which is just one step to the left from my current position at (3,9). But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, from (3,9) to (2,9), it's just one step left. There are no other snakes or parts of my own body in the way, as far as I can tell. So, it seems safe to move left to eat that apple.\n\nBut, I should think about what to do after eating that apple. Once I eat the apple at (2,9), I'll grow longer, so I need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid hitting myself.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,9), I could consider moving up or down to reach other apples. Let's see:\n\nIf I move left to (2,9), then from there, I can look around. The apple at (6,7) is down and to the right, so I would need to move down to row 7 and then right to column 6.\n\nBut, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake at (8,6). I don't know the length of the enemy snake, but since its body is listed as empty, it's probably just its head at (8,6).\n\nSo, if I go down to row 7, I need to make sure that the path is clear and that the enemy snake isn't moving in a way that would block me or collide with me.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (2,5), which is straight down from my current position. If I move left to (2,9), then down to (2,8), (2,7), and so on until (2,5).\n\nThat seems like a straightforward path, but I need to check if there are any obstacles in that column.\n\nLooking at the board, column 2:\n\nRow 9: A\n\nRow 8: .\n\nRow 7: .\n\nRow 6: .\n\nRow 5: A\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: .\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 0: A\n\nSo, column 2 has apples at row 9, row 5, and row 0. If I move to (2,9), then down to (2,5), and then\u7ee7\u7eed down to (2,0), I could eat all three apples in that column.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that as I'm moving down, I'm not growing too long and potentially hitting my own tail.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left from (3,9) to (2,9) to eat the apple at (2,9). Now, my snake has grown, so I have a tail at (3,9).\n\n2. Move down to (2,8). No apple here.\n\n3. Move down to (2,7). No apple.\n\n4. Move down to (2,6). No apple.\n\n5. Move down to (2,5) to eat the apple at (2,5). Now, I grow again, so my tail is at (2,6).\n\n6. Move down to (2,4).\n\n7. Move down to (2,3).\n\n8. Move down to (2,2).\n\n9. Move down to (2,1).\n\n10. Move down to (2,0) to eat the apple at (2,0). Grow again, tail at (2,1).\n\nAt this point, I've eaten three apples, and my snake is longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut, I should also consider that while I'm moving down column 2, there might be other snakes moving around. Specifically, snake #1 is at (8,6), and I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (2,9), I could consider moving right to column 6 to get the apple at (6,7).\n\nLet's think about that path:\n\n1. Move left to (2,9) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Then, move down to (2,8).\n\n3. Continue down to (2,7).\n\n4. Then, move right to (3,7).\n\n5. Continue right to (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) to eat the apple at (6,7).\n\nThis path also seems possible, but again, I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail.\n\nComparing the two paths:\n\n- Path 1: Down column 2 to eat apples at (2,9), (2,5), and (2,0).\n\n- Path 2: Down to (2,7), then right to (6,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nPath 1 allows me to eat three apples, but it's a longer path and increases the risk of hitting my own tail.\n\nPath 2 allows me to eat two apples (at (2,9) and (6,7)), but it's a shorter path and might be less risky.\n\nI need to consider the time constraints and the potential movements of the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Path 2 is a better option for now. I can eat two apples relatively quickly without extending my snake too much.\n\nSo, let's plan for Path 2:\n\n1. Move left to (2,9) to eat the apple.\n\n2. Move down to (2,8).\n\n3. Move down to (2,7).\n\n4. Move right to (3,7).\n\n5. Move right to (4,7).\n\n6. Move right to (5,7).\n\n7. Move right to (6,7) to eat the apple at (6,7).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,7), I would have grown again, and my tail would be at (5,7).\n\nAt this point, I could consider moving down to row 6, where there's an enemy snake at (8,6). But I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nAlternatively, after eating the apple at (6,7), I could move up to row 5, where there's another apple at (2,5), but that would require moving left, which might not be the best idea if the enemy snake is at (8,6).\n\nWait, row 5 has an apple at (2,5), but I'm at (6,7). To get to (2,5), I would need to move left and down.\n\nThat seems like a longer path, and I might be better off focusing on eating one apple at a time.\n\nPerhaps, after eating the apple at (6,7), I should consider moving right towards the edge of the board, away from the enemy snake, and then decide what to do next.\n\nBut, looking at the board, the edge is at column 9, so from (6,7), moving right to (7,7), (8,7), (9,7). But there are no apples there, so it might not be worth it.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to row 6, but there's the enemy snake at (8,6). If I move to (6,6), (7,6), or (8,6), I risk colliding with the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps"

A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: A A . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, at row 9, column 3, that's where I am (3,8).\n\nWait, actually, looking back, position (3,8) is row 8, column 3.\n\nBut in the board layout, row 9 is the top row, row 0 is the bottom row.\n\nSo, my position is at row 8, column 3.\n\nBut in the board description, row 9 has positions like (2,9), which is column 2, row 9.\n\nWait, I think there might be some confusion in the coordinates.\n\nLet me make sure I understand the coordinates.\n\nThe board is laid out with row numbers from 0 to 9, with row 0 at the bottom and row 9 at the top.\n\nCoordinates are given as (x,y), with x being the column and y being the row.\n\nSo, (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,0) is bottom-right, (0,9) is top-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n\nGiven that, my position is (3,8), which is column 3, row 8.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (2,9): column 2, row 9\n\n- (6,7): column 6, row 7\n\n- (2,5): column 2, row 5\n\n- (1,0): column 1, row 0\n\n- (0,0): column 0, row 0\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): column 9, row 6.\n\nOkay, now I need to plan my path.\n\nFirst, the closest apple is at (2,9), which is left and up from my current position.\n\nBut actually, since I'm at (3,8), and the apple is at (2,9), I need to move left to (2,8), then up to (2,9).\n\nWait, no. If I'm at (3,8), and I want to go to (2,9), I need to move up to (3,9), then left to (2,9).\n\nWait, but according to the board layout, row 9 is the top row.\n\nSo, moving up increases the row number, moving down decreases it.\n\nMoving left decreases the column number, moving right increases it.\n\nSo, from (3,8), to get to (2,9), I need to move up to (3,9), then left to (2,9).\n\nBut looking at the board, row 8 has me at (3,8), row 9 is above it.\n\nBut in the board description, row 9 seems to have an apple at (2,9), and I'm at (3,8).\n\nWait, but in the board you provided:\n\nRow 9: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: A A . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, row 9, column 2 has an apple.\n\nI'm at row 8, column 3.\n\nTo get from (3,8) to (2,9), I need to move up to (3,9), but row 9, column 3 is empty, so I can move up to (3,9), then left to (2,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving up to (3,9) is safe.\n\nAlso, I should consider that after eating the apple, my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move after eating the apple doesn't lead me into my own tail or into the enemy snake.\n\nAdditionally, I need to think about which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's consider the possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (2,9), then decide where to go next.\n\nOption 2: Try to go for multiple apples in one path.\n\nOption 3: Go for the apple that's easiest to reach without risking running into the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Option 1 is the best starting point.\n\nSo, let's plan for Option 1.\n\nFrom (3,8), I need to move up to (3,9), then left to (2,9) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure that my next moves don't lead me back into my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can plan a path that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence without trapping myself.\n\nLooking at the board, another apple is at (6,7), which is at row 7, column 6.\n\nFrom (2,9), if I go down to (2,7), then right to (6,7), I could eat that apple as well.\n\nBut that seems like a long path, and I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake at (9,6).\n\nMoreover, there's another apple at (2,5), which is at row 5, column 2.\n\nSo, perhaps after eating the apple at (2,9), I can go down to (2,5), then perhaps to (1,0) and (0,0).\n\nBut that's a long path, and I need to ensure that I can navigate it without issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider eating the apple at (6,7) first, as it's centrally located, then maybe go for others.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, get the apple at (2,9).\n\nTo do that, from (3,8), move up to (3,9), then left to (2,9).\n\nThen, from (2,9), I can consider moving down to (2,7) to position myself for (6,7), but there's an apple at (2,5) as well.\n\nWait, moving from (2,9) down to (2,7) would skip the apple at (2,5). Maybe I should go down to (2,5) first, eat that apple, then consider moving right to (6,7).\n\nBut that would be a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (6,7) after (2,9).\n\nLet's see the distances.\n\nFrom (2,9) to (6,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: 6 - 2 = 4 steps to the right\n\n- Vertical distance: 7 - 9 = -2 steps, meaning 2 steps down\n\nSo, total steps: 4 right + 2 down = 6 steps.\n\nFrom (2,9) to (2,5):\n\n- Vertical distance: 5 - 9 = -4 steps, meaning 4 steps down.\n\nThen from (2,5) to (6,7):\n\n- Horizontal distance: 6 - 2 = 4 steps right\n\n- Vertical distance: 7 - 5 = 2 steps up\n\nSo, total steps: 4 down to (2,5), then 4 right and 2 up to (6,7), totaling 10 steps.\n\nThat seems longer than directly going from (2,9) to (6,7) in 6 steps.\n\nTherefore,"
