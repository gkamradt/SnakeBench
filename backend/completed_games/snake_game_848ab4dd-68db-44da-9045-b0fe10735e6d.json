To plan a route there, we want to decrease both the x and y differences. \n\nAnalyzing our safe moves:\n\u2022 Moving RIGHT from (6,8) puts us at (7,8). From (7,8) the distance to (8,7) becomes |8\u20137| + |7\u20138| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\u2022 Moving DOWN to (6,7) would put us at a distance |8\u20136| + |7\u20137| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n\u2022 Moving UP (6,9) isn\u2019t directly helpful toward (8,7) since it increases the vertical gap.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but moving RIGHT aligns our x coordinate closer to the apple. Staying on the same row (y = 8) and then adjusting with a DOWN move later gives us flexible options and minimizes lateral deviation.\n\nTherefore, to approach the apple at (8,7) consistently while keeping safe, the best move is to go RIGHT.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
