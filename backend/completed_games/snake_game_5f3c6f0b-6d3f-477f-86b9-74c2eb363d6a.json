We need to decide which direction to move next.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple to our current position is at (3, 7), which is two steps right. We also have an enemy snake at position (1, 6), which is a direct threat to us at the moment.\n\nConsidering the rules, our priority should be to grow our snake by eating an apple. Since the apple at (3, 7) is the closest, we'll target that one first.\n\nTo reach the apple at (3, 7), we need to move right. We can't move down because we'll hit the enemy snake, and moving left or up won't bring us closer to the apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving right, we'll reassess the situation and decide which direction to move next, taking into account the position of the enemy snake and the remaining apples.\n\nWe should also be cautious of the enemy snake's position. If we move right, we'll be moving away from the enemy snake, which is a good thing.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
