Snake #2 has moved from (6, 8) to (5, 8), with its body now at [(6, 8)]. It seems to be continuing its movement towards the left side of the board, which is beneficial for me.\n\n3. My options for the next move are:\n   - Continue moving LEFT to get closer to the apples at (2, 6) and (0, 1)\n   - Move UP to potentially block Snake #2's path and secure the apples on the left side of the board\n   - Move DOWN to create some distance between myself and Snake #2\n\n4. Continuing to move LEFT is the most straightforward option, as it directly aligns with my current strategy of collecting the apples at (2, 6) and (0, 1).\n\n5. Moving UP could be an interesting strategic move to block Snake #2's path and prevent it from easily accessing the apples on the left side of the board. However, it might lead to a confrontation if Snake #2 decides to change direction.\n\n6. Moving DOWN would create more distance between myself and Snake #2, but it would also delay my progress towards the apples I'm targeting.\n\n7. Considering the current situation, I believe continuing to move LEFT is the best choice. It allows me to stay focused on my current strategy while keeping a safe distance from Snake #2.\n\nStrategy for the next turn:\n- Continue moving LEFT until I reach the apple at (2, 6).\n- After collecting the apple at (2, 6), reassess the situation and decide whether to continue moving LEFT towards (0, 1) or consider other options based on Snake #2's movements.\n- Keep monitoring Snake #2's position and be prepared to adapt my strategy if necessary.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
