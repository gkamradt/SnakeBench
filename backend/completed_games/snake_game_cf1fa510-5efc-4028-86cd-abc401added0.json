If indeed there was an apple and it was collected at (3, 6) as last noted (despite the discrepancy), the nearest next targets should be evaluated. Moving RIGHT towards the center of the board, closer to (1, 1) and (2, 0), could be a strategic choice.\n   - Conserving movements towards central parts may offer more flexibility for future turns and apple collections.\n   - It is important to stay flexible and ready to shift directions as the whereabouts of Snake #2 and new apple spawns might change the strategy.\n\n**Future Considerations**:\n   - After this move, based on my new position and the dynamic of the board (including possible new apple spawns), I will need to reassess the closest targets and potential threats from Snake #2.\n   - Continue to prioritize apple collection while maintaining a safe distance from walls and other snakes.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**.

If indeed there was an apple and it was collected at (3, 6) as last noted (despite the discrepancy), the nearest next targets should be evaluated. Moving RIGHT towards the center of the board, closer to (1, 1) and (2, 0), could be a strategic choice.\n   - Conserving movements towards central parts may offer more flexibility for future turns and apple collections.\n   - It is important to stay flexible and ready to shift directions as the whereabouts of Snake #2 and new apple spawns might change the strategy.\n\n**Future Considerations**:\n   - After this move, based on my new position and the dynamic of the board (including possible new apple spawns), I will need to reassess the closest targets and potential threats from Snake #2.\n   - Continue to prioritize apple collection while maintaining a safe distance from walls and other snakes.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**.

If indeed there was an apple and it was collected at (3, 6) as last noted (despite the discrepancy), the nearest next targets should be evaluated. Moving RIGHT towards the center of the board, closer to (1, 1) and (2, 0), could be a strategic choice.\n   - Conserving movements towards central parts may offer more flexibility for future turns and apple collections.\n   - It is important to stay flexible and ready to shift directions as the whereabouts of Snake #2 and new apple spawns might change the strategy.\n\n**Future Considerations**:\n   - After this move, based on my new position and the dynamic of the board (including possible new apple spawns), I will need to reassess the closest targets and potential threats from Snake #2.\n   - Continue to prioritize apple collection while maintaining a safe distance from walls and other snakes.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**. This will align strategically with potential apple targets and maintaining a central position for flexibility."

The closest visible apples on the board from my current position are at (1, 1) and (2, 0) in the bottom half and (8, 3) on the right side. Remaining apple at (7, 4) is less accessible.\n\n3. **Strategic Approach:**\n   - Consider movements that maximize my potential reach for these apples while maintaining safety.\n   - Remaining in the middle of the board keeps options open for future turns regarding the direction.\n\n4. **Future Planning:**\n   - Watch the movement of Snake #2, which could influence strategic decisions in subsequent turns.\n   - Keep track of new apple positions and adjust plans accordingly.\n\n5. **Board Threats and Opportunities:**\n   - No immediate threats from walls or Snake #2.\n   - The nearest apples warrant moving towards the lower right of the board.\n\nGiven the board setup and potential strategies, **RIGHT** (towards (5, 6)) is a good move, easing access towards the center and maintaining flexibility for future turns, keeping potential paths open toward several apples.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**.
