This will also give me more time to assess their movements and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nOnce I reach the (1, 2) apple, I'll have a better idea of the enemy snake's intentions.

However, if they change course and move towards the left side of the board, I'll need to be prepared to compete for those apples or find alternative paths to avoid confrontation.\n\nIt's crucial to remain flexible and adapt to the changing game state. Prioritizing safe growth and avoiding risky situations will be key to outscoring the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT, re-evaluate the enemy snake's position and movements. If they commit to the bottom-right apples, continue pursuing the (1, 2) apple and then consider the apples at (0, 4) and (0, 8). If the enemy snake changes direction, be prepared to adjust the strategy to minimize direct competition and secure points safely.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake has not made any significant movements, still focusing on the apples in the bottom-right corner of the board.\n\nWith the apple at (1, 2) now consumed, I have a few options to consider. The nearest apple is located at (0, 4), which is just two moves away. Moving DOWN would bring me closer to that apple, but I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's potential movements.\n\nAnother option is to prioritize the apple at (0, 8), which is further away but could be a safer target. By moving UP, I can maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake while still making progress towards an apple.\n\nGiven the current position of the enemy snake and the remaining apples on the board, I believe that moving UP is the safest and most strategic choice. It allows me to keep a buffer between my snake and the enemy snake while gradually making my way towards the apple at (0, 8). This move also keeps my options open for future turns, depending on how the enemy snake responds.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP, reassess the enemy snake's movements and position. If they continue to focus on the bottom-right apples, continue moving towards the apple at (0, 8). However, if the enemy snake shows signs of moving towards the left side of the board, be prepared to adjust the strategy accordingly. Consider the apple at (0, 4) as a backup option if it becomes more feasible to reach safely.\n\nNext move: UP"

Moving towards this apple seems to be the best option, as it is in a direction that is away from the enemy snake #1, which is at (1, 8) with its body at (2, 8). The apple at (1, 2) is also close, but it is in a direction that could potentially lead to a confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will move towards the apple at (8, 5), as it seems to be the safest and most advantageous move. This will also put me in a better position to potentially collect the apple at (9, 4) if the path remains clear.\n\nNext move: UP\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving up, I will be at (8, 3). I will then assess the position of the enemy snake and the remaining apples to determine the safest and most advantageous move. I will aim to avoid direct confrontation with the enemy snake while trying to collect as many apples as possible. If the path to the apple at (8, 5) is clear, I will move in that direction.

            "rationale": "Thinking out loud:\nAfter moving UP in the previous turn, my snake is now positioned at (1, 9), which is the top-left corner of the board. The enemy snake remains focused on the apples in the bottom-right corner, with its head at (8, 3) and body extending towards the bottom-left.\n\nFrom my current position, I have two viable options: moving RIGHT or DOWN. Moving RIGHT would allow me to start making my way towards the apple at (9, 4), which is the furthest apple from the enemy snake. This could be a strategic long-term goal, as it would allow me to grow and potentially cut off the enemy snake's access to the remaining apples in the top-right corner.\n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN would bring me closer to the apple at (0, 8), which was my initial target. This apple is still relatively safe to reach, as the enemy snake is far away and focused on the bottom-right corner.\n\nConsidering the current board state and the enemy snake's position, I believe that moving DOWN is the best choice for this turn. It allows me to make progress towards the apple at (0, 8) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. Additionally, moving DOWN keeps my options open for future turns, as I can still consider targeting the apple at (9, 4) if the situation changes.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN, continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements. If they start to move towards the left side of the board, be prepared to adjust the strategy and potentially prioritize the apple at (9, 4). However, if the enemy snake remains focused on the bottom-right corner, continue moving towards the apple at (0, 8) while maintaining a safe distance.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
