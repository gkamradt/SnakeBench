There are no immediate threats from enemy snakes or obstacles.\n    - **Advantages:**\n      - **Apple Collection:** Moving UP will allow the snake to collect the apple at (3, 9), granting an additional point and causing the snake to grow longer. This can be strategically beneficial for blocking enemy paths or controlling space.\n      - **Positioning:** Being at (3, 9) places the snake near the top of the board, potentially offering clear paths to other apples while minimizing interactions with the enemy snake at (3, 6).\n    - **Disadvantages:**\n      - **Limited Immediate Options:** After moving UP, the available moves might be more restricted, especially if other obstacles or enemy snakes are nearby in subsequent turns.\n\n  - **DOWN (3, 7):**\n    - **Safety:** The cell is within bounds and appears to be unoccupied. However, moving DOWN brings the snake closer to the enemy snake at (3, 6), increasing the risk of collision in future moves.\n    - **Advantages:**\n      - **Access to Multiple Apples:** Moving DOWN keeps the snake in proximity to other apples on the board, such as the one at (4, 5).\n    - **Disadvantages:**\n      - **Increased Risk:** Proximity to the enemy snake may limit safe movement options in subsequent turns.\n\n  - **LEFT (2, 8):**\n    - **Safety:** The cell (2, 8) is within bounds and unoccupied.\n    - **Advantages:**\n      - **Flexibility:** Moving LEFT provides access to different areas of the board, potentially avoiding immediate threats.\n    - **Disadvantages:**\n      - **No Immediate Apple:** This move does not result in collecting an apple, possibly delaying point accumulation.\n\n  - **RIGHT (4, 8):**\n    - **Safety:** The cell (4, 8) is within bounds and unoccupied.\n    - **Advantages:**\n      - **Access to Apples:** Moving RIGHT positions the snake closer to the apple at (4, 5) in future turns.\n    - **Disadvantages:**\n      - **No Immediate Apple:** Similar to moving LEFT, this does not grant an immediate point.\n\n- **Strategic Decision:**\n  - **Primary Goal:** Safely collect apples to maximize points while minimizing the risk of collisions with enemies or self.\n  - **Optimal Path:** Moving **UP** to (3, 9) allows the snake to collect the nearby apple, enhancing both score and length.
