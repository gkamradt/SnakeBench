            "rationale": "Analyzing our current board, our snake now has its head at (2,7) with the body trailing upward and to our right. The enemy snake is at (4,7), which makes moving to the right a risk. From our head at (2,7) the available moves are:\n\n\u2022 UP \u2192 (2,8) is occupied by our own body.  \n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) is open but puts us closer to enemy snake #1 at (4,7).  \n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (2,6) is safe but doesn\u2019t immediately steer us away from the enemy\u2019s zone.  \n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 (1,7) is open and moves us away from the enemy snake.\n\nConsidering the remaining apples [(0,1), (7,1), (7,2), (9,5), (9,6)], the apple at (0,1) is one of the closest (a Manhattan distance of 8 from our current head), and moving left sets us on a course toward that target while keeping a safe distance from enemy snake #1.\n\nTherefore, the chosen strategy is to move LEFT so that we can head toward the apple at (0,1) with lower risk of encountering the enemy.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
