The closest apple is now at (5, 4), which is reachable by going right and down\n2. However, going down might be risky with the enemy snake's presence\n3. The safer option might be to go up and then right toward the apples at (6, 7) and (7, 8)\n4. This keeps me away from the enemy snake and gives me access to multiple apples\n\nI think UP is the best move because:\n1. It creates safe distance from the enemy snake\n2. Sets up a path to reach the upper apples\n3. Gives me more room to maneuver\n4. Keeps multiple options open\n\nNext turn strategy:\n- After moving up, evaluate whether to continue up toward (6, 7) and (7, 8) or move right toward (5, 4)\n\nUP"
