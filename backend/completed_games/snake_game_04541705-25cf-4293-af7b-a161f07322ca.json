            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4). There are apples at (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), and (6,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (0,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (9,4), which is on the top row, fourth column from the left. There are apples at various positions: (2,7) is somewhere in the middle-upper part, (8,5) is near the top-right, (4,1) is in the middle-lower part, (5,0) is on the bottom row, and (6,6) is in the middle.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the other snake and any potential obstacles.\n\nLet me list the distances from my current position to each apple using Manhattan distance, since the snake can only move in four directions.\n\n- To (2,7): |9-2| + |4-7| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (8,5): |9-8| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (4,1): |9-4| + |4-1| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- To (5,0): |9-5| + |4-0| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (6,6): |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,5), which is only 2 steps away. That seems like a good target.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any obstacles or if the other snake might interfere.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2 (my head)\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . . (snake 1 at (0,8))\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . . (apple at (2,7))\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . A . . . (apple at (6,6))\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A . (apple at (8,5))\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . 2 (my head)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . . (apple at (4,1))\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . . (apple at (5,0))\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my head is at (9,4), and the closest apple is at (8,5), which is one row up and one column to the left.\n\nWait, actually, from (9,4) to (8,5) is up one and right one.\n\nWait, coordinates are (x,y), with x increasing to the right and y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, to go from (9,4) to (8,5), I need to move left (decrease x by 1) and up (increase y by 1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only choose one direction. So, I need to decide which direction to move first.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving up to (9,5) first, and then left to (8,5) in the next turn.\n\nOr move left to (8,4), and then up to (8,5).\n\nI need to see which path is safer and shorter.\n\nLet me consider moving up to (9,5). Is that position empty? From the board state, row 9 is all dots except for my head at (9,4), so (9,5) should be empty.\n\nThen, from (9,5), I can move left to (8,5).\n\nBut moving up to (9,5) and then left to (8,5) would take two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,4), and then up to (8,5) would also take two moves.\n\nSo, in either case, it's two moves to reach the apple at (8,5).\n\nBut perhaps I can consider moving diagonally, but in this game, you can only move one direction per turn.\n\nWait, actually, in standard Snake games, you can't move diagonally; you can only move up, down, left, or right.\n\nSo, I need to choose one direction per turn.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), or left to (8,4), then up to (8,5).\n\nI need to decide which direction to go first.\n\nI should also consider if there are any obstacles in either path.\n\nLooking at the board, row 9 is open except for my head, and column 8 seems open.\n\nSo, both paths seem clear.\n\nPerhaps moving left to (8,4) first, then up to (8,5).\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (0,8), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nWhere is snake 1? At (0,8), which is the bottom row, eighth column.\n\nFrom there, it can move up, down, left, or right.\n\nBut in the board state, row 8 shows '1' at column 0, but the position is (0,8), which is row 8, column 0.\n\nWait, maybe there's confusion in row and column ordering.\n\nWait, in the board state, row 8 is shown as:\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, snake 1 is at (0,8), which is row 8, column 0.\n\nI need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nBut in my path to (8,5) from (9,4), I'm moving up and left, which is towards the top-left direction.\n\nSnake 1 is at (0,8), which is bottom-left.\n\nSo, it's not immediately in my way.\n\nAdditionally, snake 1 would have to move towards my path to interfere, but I don't have information about its movement yet.\n\nFor now, I'll assume it's not going to block my path immediately.\n\nSo, proceeding with the plan to move towards (8,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or closer in some way.\n\nLet's look at the other apples.\n\nApple at (2,7): that's quite far, 10 steps away.\n\nApple at (4,1): 5 steps down and left.\n\nApple at (5,0): 5 steps down and left.\n\nApple at (6,6): 3 steps up and right.\n\nWait, distance to (6,6) is |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, that's closer than (4,1) and (5,0), but still farther than (8,5).\n\nSo, (8,5) is still the closest.\n\nWait, unless there's another apple at (8,5); no, (8,5) is an apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,5) is already at (8,5), so moving to (8,5) would eat that apple.\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (8,5), and I'm at (9,4). Moving to (8,5) would be moving diagonally, but in this game, I can only move one direction per turn.\n\nSo, to get to (8,5), I need to move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), or left to (8,4), then up to (8,5).\n\nIn either case, it's two moves.\n\nAssuming the path is clear, I can proceed.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if there are any potential threats or if I can plan for multiple apples.\n\nWait, if I eat the apple at (8,5), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without running into my own body.\n\nCurrently, my snake is just the head at (9,4), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nBut after eating the apple at (8,5), my snake will have a body part at (9,4), and my head will be at (8,5).\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (8,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nLet's see, the next closest apple might be (6,6), which is two steps down and left from (8,5).\n\nWait, from (8,5)"

There are apples at (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), and (6,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (0,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

That seems like a good target.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any obstacles or if the other snake might interfere.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2 (my head)\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, my snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. So, I'm on row 8, column 4.\n\nThere are apples at (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), and (6,6). I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple to minimize the time and risk involved. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple.\n\n- To (2,7): |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- To (8,5): |8-8| + |4-5| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- To (4,1): |8-4| + |4-1| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- To (5,0): |8-5| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- To (6,6): |8-6| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nOkay, so the closest apple is at (8,5), just one step up from my current position.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, row 8, column 5 is where the apple is at (8,5). My current position is (8,4), which is row 8, column 4.\n\nIf I move right from (8,4) to (8,5), I'll eat the apple. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right is safe. Is there another snake or any part of my own body in that position? From the board state, it looks like it's just the apple there.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake, which is snake #1 at position (1,8). But that's at row 1, column 8, which is somewhere else on the board. It doesn't seem to be in my immediate path.\n\nSo, moving right to (8,5) seems safe and efficient.\n\nAfter eating that apple, my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail behind me. I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for this move, just going right to eat the apple should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for a different apple, but since (8,5) is the closest, it makes sense to go for that one first.\n\nI should also think about my path after eating this apple. What's the next apple I should go for?\n\nAfter eating (8,5), I'll be at (8,5), and the next closest apple would be (6,6), which is two steps down and one step to the left from my new position.\n\nSo, from (8,5) to (6,6): down twice, left once.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear. Let's see:\n\n- From (8,5) down to (7,5)\n\n- Then down to (6,5)\n\n- Then left to (6,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, assuming there are no obstacles in those positions.\n\nBut for now, my immediate goal is to move right to (8,5) and eat that apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any danger from the other snake. Snake #1 is at (1,8), and I don't know its direction or intentions. But since it's relatively far away, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nAdditionally, I need to remember that after eating the apple, my snake will grow, so I need to be cautious not to run into my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nBut for this turn, moving right to (8,5) seems to be the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,5), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next. Likely, I'll aim for (6,6) next, as it's relatively close and doesn't seem to be threatened by the other snake's position. I'll need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into my own tail or the other snake.\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4). There are apples at (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), and (6,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (0,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (9,4), which is on the top row, fourth column from the left. There are apples at various positions: (2,7) is somewhere in the middle-upper part, (8,5) is near the top-right, (4,1) is in the middle-lower part, (5,0) is on the bottom row, and (6,6) is in the middle.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the other snake and any potential obstacles.\n\nLet me list the distances from my current position to each apple using Manhattan distance, since the snake can only move in four directions.\n\n- To (2,7): |9-2| + |4-7| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (8,5): |9-8| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (4,1): |9-4| + |4-1| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- To (5,0): |9-5| + |4-0| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (6,6): |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,5), which is only 2 steps away. That seems like a good target.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any obstacles or if the other snake might interfere.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2 (my head)\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . . (snake 1 at (0,8))\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . . (apple at (2,7))\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . A . . . (apple at (6,6))\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A . (apple at (8,5))\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . 2 (my head)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . . (apple at (4,1))\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . . (apple at (5,0))\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my head is at (9,4), and the closest apple is at (8,5), which is one row up and one column to the left.\n\nWait, actually, from (9,4) to (8,5) is up one and right one.\n\nWait, coordinates are (x,y), with x increasing to the right and y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, to go from (9,4) to (8,5), I need to move left (decrease x by 1) and up (increase y by 1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only choose one direction. So, I need to decide which direction to move first.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving up to (9,5) first, and then left to (8,5) in the next turn.\n\nOr move left to (8,4), and then up to (8,5).\n\nI need to see which path is safer and shorter.\n\nLet me consider moving up to (9,5). Is that position empty? From the board state, row 9 is all dots except for my head at (9,4), so (9,5) should be empty.\n\nThen, from (9,5), I can move left to (8,5).\n\nBut moving up to (9,5) and then left to (8,5) would take two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,4), and then up to (8,5) would also take two moves.\n\nSo, in either case, it's two moves to reach the apple at (8,5).\n\nBut perhaps I can consider moving diagonally, but in this game, you can only move one direction per turn.\n\nWait, actually, in standard Snake games, you can't move diagonally; you can only move up, down, left, or right.\n\nSo, I need to choose one direction per turn.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), or left to (8,4), then up to (8,5).\n\nI need to decide which direction to go first.\n\nI should also consider if there are any obstacles in either path.\n\nLooking at the board, row 9 is open except for my head, and column 8 seems open.\n\nSo, both paths seem clear.\n\nPerhaps moving left to (8,4) first, then up to (8,5).\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (0,8), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nWhere is snake 1? At (0,8), which is the bottom row, eighth column.\n\nFrom there, it can move up, down, left, or right.\n\nBut in the board state, row 8 shows '1' at column 0, but the position is (0,8), which is row 8, column 0.\n\nWait, maybe there's confusion in row and column ordering.\n\nWait, in the board state, row 8 is shown as:\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, snake 1 is at (0,8), which is row 8, column 0.\n\nI need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nBut in my path to (8,5) from (9,4), I'm moving up and left, which is towards the top-left direction.\n\nSnake 1 is at (0,8), which is bottom-left.\n\nSo, it's not immediately in my way.\n\nAdditionally, snake 1 would have to move towards my path to interfere, but I don't have information about its movement yet.\n\nFor now, I'll assume it's not going to block my path immediately.\n\nSo, proceeding with the plan to move towards (8,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or closer in some way.\n\nLet's look at the other apples.\n\nApple at (2,7): that's quite far, 10 steps away.\n\nApple at (4,1): 5 steps down and left.\n\nApple at (5,0): 5 steps down and left.\n\nApple at (6,6): 3 steps up and right.\n\nWait, distance to (6,6) is |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, that's closer than (4,1) and (5,0), but still farther than (8,5).\n\nSo, (8,5) is still the closest.\n\nWait, unless there's another apple at (8,5); no, (8,5) is an apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,5) is already at (8,5), so moving to (8,5) would eat that apple.\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (8,5), and I'm at (9,4). Moving to (8,5) would be moving diagonally, but in this game, I can only move one direction per turn.\n\nSo, to get to (8,5), I need to move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), or left to (8,4), then up to (8,5).\n\nIn either case, it's two moves.\n\nAssuming the path is clear, I can proceed.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if there are any potential threats or if I can plan for multiple apples.\n\nWait, if I eat the apple at (8,5), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without running into my own body.\n\nCurrently, my snake is just the head at (9,4), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nBut after eating the apple at (8,5), my snake will have a body part at (9,4), and my head will be at (8,5).\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (8,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nLet's see, the next closest apple might be (6,6), which is two steps down and left from (8,5).\n\nWait, from (8,5)"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4). That's row 9, column 4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the positions of the apples and other snakes.\n\nApples are located at:\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,0)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nEnemy snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 is at position (2,8) with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nMy last move was to the right, and I chose that direction because it was the closest apple at (8,5), which is right next to me.\n\nLooking back, moving right from (9,4) to (9,5) would have been to pick up the apple at (8,5)?

There's an apple at (8,5), which is diagonally up and to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mismatch between the coordinates and the board display.\n\nLet me try to map the coordinates properly.\n\nThe board state is shown with row 9 at the top:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\n7 . .

A . . . .\n\n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, row 9, column 9 is the top-right corner.\n\nMy snake is at (9,4), which is row 9, column 4.\n\nThe apple at (8,5) is row 8, column 5, which is diagonally down and to the left from my position.\n\nWait, no, since row decreases as we go down, row 8 is below row 9.\n\nSo, from (9,4), moving down to (8,4), then right to (8,5) to eat the apple.\n\nBut in my last move, I moved right to (9,5), which doesn't align with the apple's position.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in understanding the coordinates.\n\nLet me try to plot my position and the apple's position correctly.\n\nIf I'm at (9,4), and the apple is at (8,5), to move from (9,4) to (8,5), I need to move up one row (from 9 to 8) and right one column (from 4 to 5).\n\nSo, it's a diagonal move up and to the right.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, you can only move in cardinal directions: up, down, left, right, not diagonally.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to move up first to (8,4), then right to (8,5).\n\nBut I need to make a single move at a time.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should move up to (8,4) this turn, then right to (8,5) next turn.\n\nBut in my last move, I moved right to (9,5), which doesn't seem to align with that path.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is actually at (9,5), and that's why I moved right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut looking back at the board state, row 9, column 5 is empty, as per the board display.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a mistake in the apple positions.\n\nLet me check the apple positions again: (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), (6,6).\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- (2,7): row 2, column 7, which is '.', no apple shown there.\n\n- (8,5): row 8, column 5, which is '.', but marked as 'A' in the board state.\n\nWait, in the board state, row 8, column 5 is marked as '.', not 'A'. Wait, let's check:\n\nRow 8: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- Row 7, column 2: (7,2)\n\n- Row 6, column 6: (6,6)\n\n- Row 5, column 8: (5,8)\n\n- Row 1, column 4: (1,4)\n\n- Row 0, column 5: (0,5)\n\nWait, but the apple positions given are (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), (6,6).\n\nThere seems to be a mismatch between the coordinates provided and the board display.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are given as (row, column), with row increasing upwards, which matches the board display.\n\nSo, (2,7) would be row 2, column 7, which is '.', not 'A'.\n\nBut in the board state, 'A' is at row 7, column 2; row 6, column 6; row 5, column 8; row 1, column 4; row 0, column 5.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the apple positions are transposed.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple positions are given as (column, row) instead of (row, column).\n\nLet's check:\n\n- (2,7): column 2, row 7 \u2192 position (7,2), which is 'A' on the board.\n\n- (8,5): column 8, row 5 \u2192 position (5,8), which is 'A'.\n\n- (4,1): column 4, row 1 \u2192 position (1,4), 'A'.\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0 \u2192 position (0,5), 'A'.\n\n- (6,6): column 6, row 6 \u2192 position (6,6), 'A'.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the apple positions should be interpreted as (column, row), not (row, column).\n\nTherefore, the apples are at:\n\n- (column 2, row 7) \u2192 (7,2)\n\n- (column 8, row 5) \u2192 (5,8)\n\n- (column 4, row 1) \u2192 (1,4)\n\n- (column 5, row 0) \u2192 (0,5)\n\n- (column 6, row 6) \u2192 (6,6)\n\nAnd my position is (9,4), which is row 9, column 4.\n\nNow, I need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's understand the directions:\n\n- Up: increase row number (towards row 9)\n\n- Down: decrease row number (towards row 0)\n\n- Left: decrease column number\n\n- Right: increase column number\n\nMy goal is to eat the apples while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, and my own body.\n\nI need to decide the best immediate move.\n\nLet's consider the distances to the apples from my current position (9,4).\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (7,2): |9-7| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (5,8): |9-5| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,4): |9-1| + |4-4| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\n- (0,5): |9-0| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n\n- (6,6): |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,2), with a distance of 4.\n\nLet's plan a path to (7,2).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Move left"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4). There are apples at (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), and (6,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (0,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nMy position is (9,4), which is on the top row, fourth column from the left. There are apples at various positions: (2,7) is somewhere in the middle-upper part, (8,5) is near the top-right, (4,1) is in the middle-lower part, (5,0) is on the bottom row, and (6,6) is in the middle.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the other snake and any potential obstacles.\n\nLet me list the distances from my current position to each apple using Manhattan distance, since the snake can only move in four directions.\n\n- To (2,7): |9-2| + |4-7| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (8,5): |9-8| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (4,1): |9-4| + |4-1| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- To (5,0): |9-5| + |4-0| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (6,6): |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,5), which is only 2 steps away. That seems like a good target.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any obstacles or if the other snake might interfere.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . 2 (my head)\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . . (snake 1 at (0,8))\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . . (apple at (2,7))\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . A . . . (apple at (6,6))\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A . (apple at (8,5))\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . 2 (my head)\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . . (apple at (4,1))\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . . (apple at (5,0))\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my head is at (9,4), and the closest apple is at (8,5), which is one row up and one column to the left.\n\nWait, actually, from (9,4) to (8,5) is up one and right one.\n\nWait, coordinates are (x,y), with x increasing to the right and y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, to go from (9,4) to (8,5), I need to move left (decrease x by 1) and up (increase y by 1).\n\nBut in this turn, I can only choose one direction. So, I need to decide which direction to move first.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider moving up to (9,5) first, and then left to (8,5) in the next turn.\n\nOr move left to (8,4), and then up to (8,5).\n\nI need to see which path is safer and shorter.\n\nLet me consider moving up to (9,5). Is that position empty? From the board state, row 9 is all dots except for my head at (9,4), so (9,5) should be empty.\n\nThen, from (9,5), I can move left to (8,5).\n\nBut moving up to (9,5) and then left to (8,5) would take two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,4), and then up to (8,5) would also take two moves.\n\nSo, in either case, it's two moves to reach the apple at (8,5).\n\nBut perhaps I can consider moving diagonally, but in this game, you can only move one direction per turn.\n\nWait, actually, in standard Snake games, you can't move diagonally; you can only move up, down, left, or right.\n\nSo, I need to choose one direction per turn.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), or left to (8,4), then up to (8,5).\n\nI need to decide which direction to go first.\n\nI should also consider if there are any obstacles in either path.\n\nLooking at the board, row 9 is open except for my head, and column 8 seems open.\n\nSo, both paths seem clear.\n\nPerhaps moving left to (8,4) first, then up to (8,5).\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (0,8), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nWhere is snake 1? At (0,8), which is the bottom row, eighth column.\n\nFrom there, it can move up, down, left, or right.\n\nBut in the board state, row 8 shows '1' at column 0, but the position is (0,8), which is row 8, column 0.\n\nWait, maybe there's confusion in row and column ordering.\n\nWait, in the board state, row 8 is shown as:\n\nRow 8: 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, snake 1 is at (0,8), which is row 8, column 0.\n\nI need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nBut in my path to (8,5) from (9,4), I'm moving up and left, which is towards the top-left direction.\n\nSnake 1 is at (0,8), which is bottom-left.\n\nSo, it's not immediately in my way.\n\nAdditionally, snake 1 would have to move towards my path to interfere, but I don't have information about its movement yet.\n\nFor now, I'll assume it's not going to block my path immediately.\n\nSo, proceeding with the plan to move towards (8,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that might be safer or closer in some way.\n\nLet's look at the other apples.\n\nApple at (2,7): that's quite far, 10 steps away.\n\nApple at (4,1): 5 steps down and left.\n\nApple at (5,0): 5 steps down and left.\n\nApple at (6,6): 3 steps up and right.\n\nWait, distance to (6,6) is |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, that's closer than (4,1) and (5,0), but still farther than (8,5).\n\nSo, (8,5) is still the closest.\n\nWait, unless there's another apple at (8,5); no, (8,5) is an apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,5) is already at (8,5), so moving to (8,5) would eat that apple.\n\nWait, no, the apple is at (8,5), and I'm at (9,4). Moving to (8,5) would be moving diagonally, but in this game, I can only move one direction per turn.\n\nSo, to get to (8,5), I need to move up to (9,5), then left to (8,5), or left to (8,4), then up to (8,5).\n\nIn either case, it's two moves.\n\nAssuming the path is clear, I can proceed.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if there are any potential threats or if I can plan for multiple apples.\n\nWait, if I eat the apple at (8,5), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that I have enough space to maneuver without running into my own body.\n\nCurrently, my snake is just the head at (9,4), so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nBut after eating the apple at (8,5), my snake will have a body part at (9,4), and my head will be at (8,5).\n\nThen, I need to plan my next moves accordingly.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (8,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nLet's see, the next closest apple might be (6,6), which is two steps down and left from (8,5).\n\nWait, from (8,5)"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, my snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the bottom left and going up to (9,9) in the top right. So, I'm on row 8, column 4.\n\nThere are apples at (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), and (6,6). I need to decide which apple to go for first.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple to minimize the time and risk involved. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple.\n\n- To (2,7): |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9\n\n- To (8,5): |8-8| + |4-5| = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n- To (4,1): |8-4| + |4-1| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- To (5,0): |8-5| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- To (6,6): |8-6| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nOkay, so the closest apple is at (8,5), just one step up from my current position.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any obstacles in that direction. Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo, row 8, column 5 is where the apple is at (8,5). My current position is (8,4), which is row 8, column 4.\n\nIf I move right from (8,4) to (8,5), I'll eat the apple. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right is safe. Is there another snake or any part of my own body in that position? From the board state, it looks like it's just the apple there.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake, which is snake #1 at position (1,8). But that's at row 1, column 8, which is somewhere else on the board. It doesn't seem to be in my immediate path.\n\nSo, moving right to (8,5) seems safe and efficient.\n\nAfter eating that apple, my snake will grow, so I'll have a tail behind me. I need to make sure that I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for this move, just going right to eat the apple should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for a different apple, but since (8,5) is the closest, it makes sense to go for that one first.\n\nI should also think about my path after eating this apple. What's the next apple I should go for?\n\nAfter eating (8,5), I'll be at (8,5), and the next closest apple would be (6,6), which is two steps down and one step to the left from my new position.\n\nSo, from (8,5) to (6,6): down twice, left once.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear. Let's see:\n\n- From (8,5) down to (7,5)\n\n- Then down to (6,5)\n\n- Then left to (6,6)\n\nThat seems straightforward, assuming there are no obstacles in those positions.\n\nBut for now, my immediate goal is to move right to (8,5) and eat that apple.\n\nI should also consider if there's any danger from the other snake. Snake #1 is at (1,8), and I don't know its direction or intentions. But since it's relatively far away, I can proceed with my plan.\n\nAdditionally, I need to remember that after eating the apple, my snake will grow, so I need to be cautious not to run into my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nBut for this turn, moving right to (8,5) seems to be the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,5), I'll need to decide which apple to go for next. Likely, I'll aim for (6,6) next, as it's relatively close and doesn't seem to be threatened by the other snake's position. I'll need to plan my path carefully to avoid running into my own tail or the other snake.\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"

In the board state provided, row 9 is the top row, and column 0 is the leftmost column.\n\nSo, position (9,4) is on the top row, fourth column from the left.\n\nThe apple at (8,5) is one row below and one column to the right of my current position.\n\nSo, from (9,4) to (8,5) would involve moving up one row and right one column.\n\nBut in my last move, I moved right to (9,5), but according to the board state, there's no apple there. There's an apple at (8,5), which is diagonally up and to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mismatch between the coordinates and the board display.\n\nLet me try to map the coordinates properly.\n\nThe board state is shown with row 9 at the top:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . A . . . . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . . A . . .\n\n5 . . . . . . . . A .\n\n4 . . . . . . . . . 2\n\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . . . . A . . . . .\n\n0 . . . . . A . . . .\n\n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, row 9, column 9 is the top-right corner.\n\nMy snake is at (9,4), which is row 9, column 4.\n\nThe apple at (8,5) is row 8, column 5, which is diagonally down and to the left from my position.\n\nWait, no, since row decreases as we go down, row 8 is below row 9.\n\nSo, from (9,4), moving down to (8,4), then right to (8,5) to eat the apple.\n\nBut in my last move, I moved right to (9,5), which doesn't align with the apple's position.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in understanding the coordinates.\n\nLet me try to plot my position and the apple's position correctly.\n\nIf I'm at (9,4), and the apple is at (8,5), to move from (9,4) to (8,5), I need to move up one row (from 9 to 8) and right one column (from 4 to 5).\n\nSo, it's a diagonal move up and to the right.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, you can only move in cardinal directions: up, down, left, right, not diagonally.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to move up first to (8,4), then right to (8,5).\n\nBut I need to make a single move at a time.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should move up to (8,4) this turn, then right to (8,5) next turn.\n\nBut in my last move, I moved right to (9,5), which doesn't seem to align with that path.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is actually at (9,5), and that's why I moved right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut looking back at the board state, row 9, column 5 is empty, as per the board display.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a mistake in the apple positions.\n\nLet me check the apple positions again: (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), (6,6).\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- (2,7): row 2, column 7, which is '.', no apple shown there.\n\n- (8,5): row 8, column 5, which is '.', but marked as 'A' in the board state.\n\nWait, in the board state, row 8, column 5 is marked as '.', not 'A'. Wait, let's check:\n\nRow 8: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- Row 7, column 2: (7,2)\n\n- Row 6, column 6: (6,6)\n\n- Row 5, column 8: (5,8)\n\n- Row 1, column 4: (1,4)\n\n- Row 0, column 5: (0,5)\n\nWait, but the apple positions given are (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), (6,6).\n\nThere seems to be a mismatch between the coordinates provided and the board display.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are given as (row, column), with row increasing upwards, which matches the board display.\n\nSo, (2,7) would be row 2, column 7, which is '.', not 'A'.\n\nBut in the board state, 'A' is at row 7, column 2; row 6, column 6; row 5, column 8; row 1, column 4; row 0, column 5.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the apple positions are transposed.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple positions are given as (column, row) instead of (row, column).\n\nLet's check:\n\n- (2,7): column 2, row 7 \u2192 position (7,2), which is 'A' on the board.\n\n- (8,5): column 8, row 5 \u2192 position (5,8), which is 'A'.\n\n- (4,1): column 4, row 1 \u2192 position (1,4), 'A'.\n\n- (5,0): column 5, row 0 \u2192 position (0,5), 'A'.\n\n- (6,6): column 6, row 6 \u2192 position (6,6), 'A'.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the apple positions should be interpreted as (column, row), not (row, column).\n\nTherefore, the apples are at:\n\n- (column 2, row 7) \u2192 (7,2)\n\n- (column 8, row 5) \u2192 (5,8)\n\n- (column 4, row 1) \u2192 (1,4)\n\n- (column 5, row 0) \u2192 (0,5)\n\n- (column 6, row 6) \u2192 (6,6)\n\nAnd my position is (9,4), which is row 9, column 4.\n\nNow, I need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's understand the directions:\n\n- Up: increase row number (towards row 9)\n\n- Down: decrease row number (towards row 0)\n\n- Left: decrease column number\n\n- Right: increase column number\n\nMy goal is to eat the apples while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, and my own body.\n\nI need to decide the best immediate move.\n\nLet's consider the distances to the apples from my current position (9,4).\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (7,2): |9-7| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (5,8): |9-5| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,4): |9-1| + |4-4| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\n- (0,5): |9-0| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n\n- (6,6): |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,2), with a distance of 4.\n\nLet's plan a path to (7,2).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Move left"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this snake game. Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (9,4). That's row 9, column 4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the positions of the apples and other snakes.\n\nApples are located at:\n\n- (2,7)\n\n- (8,5)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,0)\n\n- (6,6)\n\nEnemy snakes:\n\n- Snake #1 is at position (2,8) with no body parts listed, so probably just the head.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the board state, it seems there might be confusion in coordinate interpretation. Let's make sure I understand the coordinates correctly.\n\nThe board state is displayed with row 9 at the top:\n\n```\n\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 8 . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\n 7 . .

A . . . .\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n```\n\nSo, position (9,4) is on the top row, fifth from the left.\n\nApples are marked as 'A' at:\n\n- (7,2)\n\n- (6,6)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (0,5)\n\nBut the apple positions given are (2,7), (8,5), (4,1), (5,0), (6,6). It seems there's a mismatch in how coordinates are presented. In the board, rows are from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom, and columns from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nWait, in the board, row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. So, position (9,4) is top row, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (7,2): row 7, column 2\n\n- (6,6): row 6, column 6\n\n- (5,8): row 5, column 8\n\n- (1,4): row 1, column 4\n\n- (0,5): row 0, column 5\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,8): row 2, column 8.\n\nI need to plan my moves to get to the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy snake and not running into walls or myself.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (9,4).\n\nUsing Manhattan distance:\n\n- To (7,2): |9-7| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (6,6): |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- To (5,8): |9-5| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (1,4): |9-1| + |4-4| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\n- To (0,5): |9-0| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n\nThe closest apple is at (7,2) with a distance of 4.\n\nSo, my initial plan is to move towards (7,2).\n\nTo get from (9,4) to (7,2), I need to move up 2 rows and left 2 columns.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (2,8). I should avoid getting too close to it.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure there are no obstacles in my path.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to move up to row 8.\n\nFrom (9,4) to (8,4).\n\nThen, from (8,4), I can move left to (8,3), then to (7,3), then to (7,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that these positions are not occupied by the enemy snake or its body.\n\nGiven that enemy snake #1 is at (2,8) with no body parts, it's probably just the head.\n\nSo, for now, I can assume that the path from (8,4) to (7,2) is clear, as the enemy is at (2,8), which is lower down.\n\nBut I need to confirm that there are no other snakes or snake bodies in the way.\n\nLooking at the board state, row 8 has . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nSo, column 2 has a '1', which is the enemy snake's head.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nFrom (8,4), moving left to (8,3) seems safe.\n\nThen from (8,3), move up to (7,3), then left to (7,2).\n\nBut perhaps there's a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,4), move up to (7,4), then left to (7,3), then left to (7,2).\n\nBut that's still 3 moves.\n\nSince the apple is only 2 rows up and 2 columns left, and I have to move step by step, it will take at least 4 moves: up, up, left, left.\n\nBut in reality, since I can only move one step at a time, I need to decide the first move.\n\nGiven that, my first move should be up to (8,4).\n\nThen next move up to (7,4), then left to (7,3), then left to (7,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving up to (8,4) is safe.\n\nLooking at row 8: . . 1 . . . . . . .\n\nSo, column 2 has the enemy snake's head.\n\nColumn 4 is empty, so it's safe to move to (8,4).\n\nAlright, so my first move is up to (8,4).\n\nThen, I can plan the next moves accordingly.\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf the enemy snake moves towards me, I need to adjust my path.\n\nHowever, since I'm several rows away, and the enemy is at (2,8), which is row 2, column 8, it would take several moves for it to reach me.\n\nMoreover, I need to consider if there are any other snakes or obstacles.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems safe to proceed towards (7,2).\n\nAnother consideration is whether there are multiple apples to go for in a sequence.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (7,2)\n\n- (6,6)\n\n- (5,8)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (0,5)\n\nAfter getting the apple at (7,2), the next closest apple would be (6,6), then perhaps (5,8), and so on.\n\nBut for now, I should focus on getting to (7,2) first.\n\nSo, my immediate move is to go up to (8,4).\n\nThen, I can continue moving up to (7,4), then left to (7,3), then left to (7,2) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or any part of my own body.\n\nAssuming my body is only at the starting position since it's just the head, I need to be careful not to create a loop that would cause me to hit my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm growing as I eat apples, I need to plan accordingly.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows, but your head moves forward.\n\nSo, as I eat apples, my snake gets longer.\n\nI need to make sure that my path doesn't lead my head into my own body.\n\nBut for the first move, that's not a concern.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Current position: (9,4)\n\n- Move up to (8,4)\n\n- Then up to (7,4)\n\n- Then left to (7,3)\n\n- Then left to (7,2) to eat the apple\n\nThis seems like a straightforward path.\n\nGiven that, my immediate move should be up to (8,4).\n\nBut let's consider if there's a shorter path or if there are any risks.\n\nAnother approach could be to move left first to (9,3), then up to (8,3), then up to (7,3), then left to (7,2).\n\nThat's also 4 moves.\n\nThe first approach is up, up, left, left.\n\nThe second approach is left, up, up, left.\n\nEither way, it's the same number of moves.\n\nPerhaps the first approach is better because it reduces the row distance first.\n\nBut in terms of safety, both paths seem equally safe.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the first approach: up, up, left, left.\n\nSo, my immediate move is up to (8,4).\n\nI need to communicate this decision.\n\nBut in the game, I need to specify the direction: up,"
