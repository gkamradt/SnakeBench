Now, I need to look for the next closest apple and plan my route accordingly. The closest apples are at (4, 8) and (6, 8), but they are quite far away from me, and I'd have to move left to reach them. There's also an apple at (2, 9), which is above me, but I'd have to move left and up to reach it.\n\nConsidering my options, I think the best move would be to move left, as it would allow me to get closer to the apples at (4, 8) and (6, 8). I'll need to be careful not to move too far left, as I don't know what might be to the left of the apples. But for now, moving left seems like the best option.\n\nI'll also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and be prepared to change direction if necessary. The enemy snake is currently at position (7, 3) with body at [(7, 2), (7, 1)], which is still quite far away from me, so I don't need to worry about it for now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving left, I'll reassess the board to see if I've gotten closer to the apples at (4, 8) and (6, 8) and adjust my strategy based on the enemy snake's position. If I get closer to the apples, I'll plan my route to reach one of them.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
