I can see two main paths to the apple:\n   a) Continue LEFT then DOWN\n   b) Go DOWN then LEFT\n\nI'll choose to go DOWN because:\n1. It immediately reduces vertical distance to the apple\n2. It gives me more flexibility in approaching the apple\n3. Even though enemy snake is nearby, I still have room to maneuver\n4.

This poses no immediate threat as long as I do not move north.\n\nPotential Strategic Move:\n- The closest apple from my current position is at (6, 4), approximately 3 units to the right and 3 units downward. \n- Other apples are also towards the right direction but slightly further away.\n\nWith considerations to keep a safe distance from walls and the enemy snake:\n1. Since I am currently at (3, 7), heading RIGHT towards (4, 7) is an initial feasible strategy to start moving towards the next closest apple.\n2. Successive moves will depend on enemy positioning and whether I need to adjust downwards to (6, 4) or towards (8, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"
