However, since I'm currently below it, I think I can safely move down without running into it.\n\nMy strategy for now is to focus on moving down towards the apple at (6, 0) while being careful not to run into the enemy snake. I should also keep an eye on the other apples and the enemy snake's movements to plan my next move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving down, I should check the positions of the enemy snake and other apples to plan my next move.

I also see an apple at (1, 9), but that's still quite far from me, so I'll focus on the closer one for now.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake #1 is at (3, 8) with body at [(4, 8)], which is still quite far from me, I should be careful not to run into it. However, since I'm currently below it, I think I can safely move down without running into it.\n\nMy strategy for now is to focus on moving down towards the apple at (6, 0) while being careful not to run into the enemy snake. I should also keep an eye on the other apples and the enemy snake's movements to plan my next move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving down, I should check the positions of the enemy snake and other apples to plan my next move. I should also be aware of my own body position to avoid running into myself.\n\nSince I'm so close to the apple at (6, 0), I think I can safely move down and eat it.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

I can see that moving left again would put me at (1, 8), which is still a safe move. However, I need to think about the long-term strategy.\n\nIf I continue moving left, I'll eventually reach the apple at (0, 5) and gain 1 point. But then what? I'll need to think about how to navigate around the enemy snake and get to the other apples.\n\nOne option is to move up towards the apple at (1, 9) after I get the apple at (0, 5). This would give me a good chance of getting two apples in a row and putting some distance between me and the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for next turn will be to continue moving towards the apple at (0, 5) and gain 1 point. Then, I'll reassess the situation and think about moving up towards the apple at (1, 9).\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
