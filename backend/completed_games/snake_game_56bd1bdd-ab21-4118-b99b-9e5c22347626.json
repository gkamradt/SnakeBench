The direction was wrong in the initial scenario due to coordinates confusion; our last move placed us at (4,7) which is directly above the apple at (4,7), so we should have eaten that apple and grown.\n\n2. Immediate Objective:\n   - Since we collected the apple at (4,7), the nearest apple is now (1,7). Heading to that apple would involve moving strategically to avoid any potential collision with walls or the enemy snake.\n\n3. Enemy Analysis:\n   - Snake #2 is close to our horizontal path at its immediate location, but its previous position does not pose an immediate threat to our plan to move to the next apple.\n\n4. Movement Direction:\n   - To reach the next apple at (1,7) safely, our best path implicates a movement LEFT from our current assumed position.\n   \n5. Strategy Summary:\n   - Continue LEFT, taking advantage of the middle range of the board to maintain a safe distance from walls and the enemy snake. After acquiring the apple at (1,7), move UP, aiming to stay centered while collecting more apples or forcing a path to reach possibly respawned apples effectively.\n\nAfter careful consideration and strategy mapping, my decided next move:\n- LEFT."

Snake #2 is currently located at (4, 5), which could pose a risk if I attempt to move downwards beyond the apple at (4, 7). However, since it currently does not have a body, its only risk position next turn would be where it decides to move.\n\n3. Considering the rules and the snake's death if it encounters walls, itself, or other snakes, and the aim of collecting more apples, moving directly towards the nearest apple appears to be safest and most strategic.\n\n4. Given that moving up will take me away from available apples and potentially corner me against the top boundary, while moving left or right does not move me closer to any apples, the logical choice is to move downwards.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- After collecting the apple at (4, 7), monitor the position of Snake #2 closely, and consider moving right towards the apple at (5, 5) if the path remains clear and safe.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN."

My current position after the last move would now be (4, 8), which was a move DOWN from (4, 9). The apple at (4, 7) is still directly beneath me and is the optimal target to pursue next.\n\n2. Enemy Snake #2 is at (5, 5), placing it near another apple at (5, 5). Given that it has only one segment in its body at (4, 5), its possible movement could be north toward (5, 6) or maintaining its position if it aims to stay near the apple. However, it could also potentially move east to claim the apple.\n\n3. To avoid any risk of collision with Snake #2, assuming it eats the apple and potentially grows to position (5, 5) merged with the new head position based on its move, it's advisable to avoid moving to the right from my current position.\n\n4. Since moving UP would be retreating from the apple at (4, 7) and not benefit in terms of points, while moving LEFT or RIGHT could be riskier given Snake #2's proximity and apples being absent in those direct paths, going DOWN seams to be the safest and most strategic move.\n\nStrategy for the next turn:\n- After collecting the apple at (4, 7), evaluate the position of Snake #2. If it moves east to claim or has claimed the apple at (5, 5), consider moving UP towards the next nearest apple at either (4, 7) after it spawns again or the further apple at (1, 7) once it's safe, avoiding congestion and potential traps.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN."

Let's break it down:\n\n1. Position Check:\n   - Our snake is currently at (4,7) after moving DOWN last from (4,8). The direction was wrong in the initial scenario due to coordinates confusion; our last move placed us at (4,7) which is directly above the apple at (4,7), so we should have eaten that apple and grown.\n\n2. Immediate Objective:\n   - Since we collected the apple at (4,7), the nearest apple is now (1,7). Heading to that apple would involve moving strategically to avoid any potential collision with walls or the enemy snake.\n\n3. Enemy Analysis:\n   - Snake #2 is close to our horizontal path at its immediate location, but its previous position does not pose an immediate threat to our plan to move to the next apple.\n\n4. Movement Direction:\n   - To reach the next apple at (1,7) safely, our best path implicates a movement LEFT from our current assumed position.\n   \n5. Strategy Summary:\n   - Continue LEFT, taking advantage of the middle range of the board to maintain a safe distance from walls and the enemy snake. After acquiring the apple at (1,7), move UP, aiming to stay centered while collecting more apples or forcing a path to reach possibly respawned apples effectively.\n\nAfter careful consideration and strategy mapping, my decided next move:\n- LEFT."
