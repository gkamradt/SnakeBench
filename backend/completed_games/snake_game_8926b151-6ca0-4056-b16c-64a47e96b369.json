After that, I can reassess the situation and decide whether to go for the apple at (5, 5) or try to get to the other apples.\n\nFor my next move, I want to move down to get closer to the apple at (3, 0). I should be careful not to run into the wall at y-coordinate 0, but since I'm at y-coordinate 1, I can safely move down one more time.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Once I get the apple at (3, 0), I should consider moving up towards the apple at (5, 5) while avoiding the enemy snake at (8, 6).\n\nNext move: DOWN"
