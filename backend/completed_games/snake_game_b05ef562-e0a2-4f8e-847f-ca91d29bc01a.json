I see four apples on the board, and I'll need to decide which one to go for.\n\nMy initial thought is to head towards the top-right apple at (0, 8), as it's relatively close and I can potentially get a good chunk of the board. However, I also need to be cautious of the enemy snake #2, which is at (2, 7) and might be a threat.\n\nI'll also consider the fact that I'm at the top-right corner, so moving down or left might put me in a more vulnerable position.\n\nAfter weighing my options, I think I'll aim for the top-right apple at (0, 8). I'll move... RIGHT."

The closest apple to my snake is at (4, 2), which is two moves away if I move down and then right. However, moving directly right into the wall would be a mistake, so I need to ensure I'm planning a safe route.\n\nGiven the current positions, I don't need to worry about enemy snakes just yet, as Snake #1 is not in my immediate path. My priority should be to collect the apples in a way that keeps me from getting boxed in and allows for easy access to future apples.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n1. Move towards the closest apple without putting myself in a position where I can't reach other apples easily.\n2. After collecting an apple, reassess the board to find the next closest apple while maintaining a safe distance from walls and enemy snakes.\n3. Try to keep my options open by avoiding moves that would corner me or limit my future movement options.\n\nBased on this strategy, my next move should be to head towards the apple at (4, 2). I will move down to (2, 6) first, and then plan to move right on the subsequent turn to collect the apple.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: DOWN."
