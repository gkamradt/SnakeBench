Move left to position (2, 1) to align with the apple at (1, 3) on the y-axis.\n2. After reaching the same y-coordinate as the apple, move up to collect it.\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on the enemy snake (ID: 1) which is currently at (7, 2). Since it's on the same row as our snake, we should be cautious not to move into its path or allow it to cut us off from the apples above.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's position and our next move, we should prioritize safety and apple collection efficiency. After collecting the apple at (1, 3), we'll need to decide whether to continue upwards towards the apple at (1, 6) or to move right towards the apple at (4, 8). This decision will depend on the enemy snake's next move, which we cannot predict. Therefore, we should remain flexible and ready to adjust our strategy.\n\nFor the next turn, after collecting the apple at (1, 3), we should consider moving up towards the apple at (1, 6) if it's safe, as it's the closest apple and aligns with our current trajectory. However, if the enemy snake moves in a way that could threaten us, we may need to move right towards the apple at (4, 8) instead.\n\nGiven the current situation, the next move should be: LEFT, to align with the apple at (1, 3) and prepare to move up on the subsequent turn.\n\n--End of strategy planning.--\n\nNext move: LEFT."
