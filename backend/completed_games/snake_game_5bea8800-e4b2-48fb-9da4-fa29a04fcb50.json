That seems like the safest long-term route.\n* Meanwhile, I need to keep an eye on snake #2's movements.

However, 1 of the apples is at (2, 1) which means I will circumvent the apple at (5, 1) and head west and score the (3 apples).

However, 1 of the apples is at (2, 1) which means I will circumvent the apple at (5, 1) and head west and score the (3 apples).

That seems like the safest long-term route.\n* Meanwhile, I need to keep an eye on snake #2's movements.
