            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (9,7). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (0,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (0,0), (4,5), (8,8), (6,7), and (3,0).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are placed. The one at (8,8) is pretty far away, so maybe not the immediate target. The apple at (6,7) is closer to me since I'm at (9,7). That's only two steps to the left. The apple at (4,5) is a bit further, and (0,0) and (3,0) are near the bottom left.\n\nMy snake is at (9,7), which is near the top right. The enemy snake is at (0,2), which is on the left side, a bit down from the top. Since it's alone, I don't have to worry about its body blocking me, but I should still be cautious about moving towards areas where it might intercept.\n\nMy last move was None, so I'm just starting from (9,7). I need to decide whether to go for the closest apple at (6,7) or maybe another one. Let me think about the possible moves.\n\nIf I move left from (9,7) to (8,7), I can get closer to the apple at (6,7). Alternatively, I could move up to (9,8) or down to (9,6). But moving up would take me towards the top, which is less populated with apples, while moving down would take me towards the middle where there are more apples.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is directly to the left of me. So moving left would get me closer. But I should check if that's the best option. Let me see the path. From (9,7) to (8,7), then (7,7), (6,7). That's three moves, and I can eat the apple there, growing by one segment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (4,5). That's a bit further, but perhaps it's worth it for more points. Let me calculate the distance. From (9,7) to (4,5): that's 5 steps left and 2 steps down, so 7 moves. That's a longer path, but maybe I can get more apples along the way.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is right there. Maybe I should prioritize eating that first. It's only three moves away, so I can get it quickly. Plus, moving left from (9,7) is straightforward, and there's no immediate obstacle.\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake. It's at (0,2), so it's on the opposite side of the board. Unless it starts moving towards me, I don't think it's a threat right now. So I can focus on collecting apples without worrying about it.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the possibility of getting stuck. If I move in a direction that might block me later, I could die. So I need to plan a path that allows me to eat the apple without getting trapped.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (9,7) seems safe. There's no snake or wall in that direction. So I can proceed to (8,7), then (7,7), and so on. Once I eat the apple at (6,7), I'll grow, and then I can decide whether to go for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if moving up or down is better. If I move up to (9,8), that's an empty space, but there's no apple there. Moving down to (9,6) is also empty. So perhaps moving left is the best option.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,8) is also on the board. That's two steps up and one step left from my current position. But that's a bit further than the apple at (6,7). So maybe I should stick with the closer one.\n\nI think the best move is to go left towards (6,7). So my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT towards the apple at (6,7) to collect it quickly and grow. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

Since it's alone, I don't have to worry about its body blocking me, but I should still be cautious about moving towards areas where it might intercept.\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which took me from (9,7) to (8,7). Now, I need to decide where to go next. The apple at (6,7) is two steps away, so moving LEFT again would take me closer. Alternatively, I could move DOWN to (8,6) or UP to (8,8), but those don't lead me directly to an apple.\n\nIf I continue moving LEFT, I can reach the apple at (6,7) in two more moves. That seems efficient. However, I should also consider the longer-term strategy. After eating the apple at (6,7), I might want to go for the apple at (4,5), which is further away but could be worth it for more points.\n\nI should also be cautious about the enemy snake. It's at (0,2), so it's on the opposite side of the board. Unless it starts moving towards me, I don't think it's a threat right now. So I can focus on collecting apples without worrying about it.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the possibility of getting stuck. If I move in a direction that might block me later, I could die. So I need to plan a path that allows me to eat the apple without getting trapped.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT again seems like the best option. It's straightforward, and I can reach the apple quickly. Once I have that, I can reassess and decide on the next move.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to continue moving LEFT towards the apple at (6,7) to collect it efficiently.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (9,7). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (0,2) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (0,0), (4,5), (8,8), (6,7), and (3,0).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see where the apples are placed. The one at (8,8) is pretty far away, so maybe not the immediate target. The apple at (6,7) is closer to me since I'm at (9,7). That's only two steps to the left. The apple at (4,5) is a bit further, and (0,0) and (3,0) are near the bottom left.\n\nMy snake is at (9,7), which is near the top right. The enemy snake is at (0,2), which is on the left side, a bit down from the top. Since it's alone, I don't have to worry about its body blocking me, but I should still be cautious about moving towards areas where it might intercept.\n\nMy last move was None, so I'm just starting from (9,7). I need to decide whether to go for the closest apple at (6,7) or maybe another one. Let me think about the possible moves.\n\nIf I move left from (9,7) to (8,7), I can get closer to the apple at (6,7). Alternatively, I could move up to (9,8) or down to (9,6). But moving up would take me towards the top, which is less populated with apples, while moving down would take me towards the middle where there are more apples.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is directly to the left of me. So moving left would get me closer. But I should check if that's the best option. Let me see the path. From (9,7) to (8,7), then (7,7), (6,7). That's three moves, and I can eat the apple there, growing by one segment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (4,5). That's a bit further, but perhaps it's worth it for more points. Let me calculate the distance. From (9,7) to (4,5): that's 5 steps left and 2 steps down, so 7 moves. That's a longer path, but maybe I can get more apples along the way.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is right there. Maybe I should prioritize eating that first. It's only three moves away, so I can get it quickly. Plus, moving left from (9,7) is straightforward, and there's no immediate obstacle.\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake. It's at (0,2), so it's on the opposite side of the board. Unless it starts moving towards me, I don't think it's a threat right now. So I can focus on collecting apples without worrying about it.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the possibility of getting stuck. If I move in a direction that might block me later, I could die. So I need to plan a path that allows me to eat the apple without getting trapped.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (9,7) seems safe. There's no snake or wall in that direction. So I can proceed to (8,7), then (7,7), and so on. Once I eat the apple at (6,7), I'll grow, and then I can decide whether to go for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if moving up or down is better. If I move up to (9,8), that's an empty space, but there's no apple there. Moving down to (9,6) is also empty. So perhaps moving left is the best option.\n\nWait, the apple at (8,8) is also on the board. That's two steps up and one step left from my current position. But that's a bit further than the apple at (6,7). So maybe I should stick with the closer one.\n\nI think the best move is to go left towards (6,7). So my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move LEFT towards the apple at (6,7) to collect it quickly and grow. \n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is a 10x10 grid, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 1 and is currently at (6,7). The enemy snake, ID 2, is at (0,5) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. There are apples at (0,0), (4,5), (8,8), (3,0), and (8,3).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are placed in different areas. The apple at (8,8) is near the top right, (4,5) is somewhere in the middle, (3,0) is near the bottom left, and (8,3) is on the right side. My snake is at (6,7), which is on the top half of the board.\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which took me from (7,7) to (6,7). Now, I need to decide where to go next. The apple I'm closest to is at (6,7), but wait, I'm already there. Oh, no, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. The apples are at (0,0), (4,5), (8,8), (3,0), and (8,3). So, the apple at (6,7) isn't listed. Maybe I misread that. So, the closest apple to me is at (8,8), which is two steps to the right and one step up from my current position.\n\nBut wait, I'm at (6,7). To get to (8,8), I need to move right twice and up once. However, I can only move one direction at a time. So, my options are to move right, up, left, or down. Moving right would take me towards (7,7), then (8,7), and then (8,8). Alternatively, moving up from (6,7) would take me to (6,8), which is closer to (8,8) but still requires moving right twice.\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake at (0,5). It's on the left side, so it's not directly blocking me from moving towards the apple at (8,8). However, I need to be cautious about the path I take to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the other apples. The apple at (8,3) is on the right side, lower down. If I go for that, I might have to move down from (6,7) to (6,6), then right to (7,6), (8,6), and then down to (8,3). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth it for the points.\n\nBut since I'm already closer to (8,8), maybe I should prioritize that first. Let me calculate the distance. From (6,7) to (8,8) is a Manhattan distance of 2 (right) + 1 (up) = 3 moves. To (8,3), it's 2 (right) + 4 (down) = 6 moves. So, (8,8) is definitely closer.\n\nNow, thinking about the possible moves from (6,7). If I move RIGHT to (7,7), that's one step towards (8,8). Then, from there, I can move RIGHT again to (8,7), and then UP to (8,8). That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if I move UP first to (6,8), then I can move RIGHT twice to (8,8). Both paths are similar in terms of steps, but moving RIGHT first might be safer because the enemy snake is on the left, and moving right keeps me away from it.\n\nI should also check if moving UP from (6,7) is safe. Is there any part of the snake's body in that area? The enemy snake is at (0,5), so it's not blocking that path. My own snake's body is at (7,7) and (6,7), so moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) is safe because my body isn't there.\n\nWait, no, my snake's head is at (6,7), and the body is at (7,7). So, moving UP to (6,8) is fine because that's not part of my body. Similarly, moving RIGHT to (7,7) is also safe.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the enemy snake might move towards me. Since it's at (0,5), it's quite far, so unless it starts moving towards the right, it's not an immediate threat. But I should still be cautious.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure I don't run into any walls. Moving LEFT from (6,7) would take me to (5,7), which is still within the board. But since I'm trying to get to (8,8), moving LEFT isn't helpful. So, better to move RIGHT or UP.\n\nLooking at the board again, the apple at (8,8) is in the top right corner. To get there, I need to move right twice and up once. So, the most efficient path is to move RIGHT twice and then UP once, or UP once and then RIGHT twice. Either way, it's three moves.\n\nI think moving RIGHT first is a good idea because it keeps me moving towards the target without any risk of collision. Plus, the enemy snake is on the opposite side, so moving right keeps me away from it.\n\nWait, but if I move UP first, I might have a clearer path. Let me visualize the board. From (6,7), moving UP to (6,8) is clear. Then, moving RIGHT to (7,8) and then to (8,8). That seems fine.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), and then UP to (8,8). Both paths are equally safe, as there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nI think I'll go with moving RIGHT first because it's the direction that gets me closer to the apple. Plus, it's a straightforward path without any potential for collision.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the apple at (8,8) is at the top right, and the board's top right is (9,9). So, (8,8) is one step away from the top right corner. That might be a good spot to be in case I want to position myself for future moves.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, after eating (8,8), I can then move towards (4,5) or (8,3). But for now, focusing on the closest apple is the priority.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the enemy snake might intercept me. Since it's at (0,5), it's not in the same area, so unless it starts moving towards me, I shouldn't worry. But I should still keep an eye on its possible movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, I should aim to collect as many apples as possible without putting myself in danger. So, moving towards (8,8) seems like a good move. After that, I can plan my next steps.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) might be better because it's closer to the apple. Let me recalculate the distance. From (6,7) to (8,8) is 2 right and 1 up. If I move UP first, I'm at (6,8), then I need to move right twice. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT first, I'm at (7,7), then (8,7), then (8,8). That's also three moves. So, moving UP first actually gets me to the apple in fewer moves because after moving UP, I only need to move right twice.\n\nWait, no, moving UP first would take me to (6,8), then I need to move right twice to (8,8). That's two moves. Whereas moving RIGHT first would take me to (7,7), then (8,7), then (8,8). That's three moves. So, moving UP first is actually more efficient.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, maybe I should prioritize moving UP to (6,8) first, then move right twice. That way, I can reach the apple in two moves instead of three.\n\nBut wait, I'm currently at (6,7). If I move UP to (6,8), that's one move. Then, from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then to (8,8). So, that's two moves after the first move. So, in total, three moves. Whereas, if I move RIGHT first, it's three moves as well. So, maybe it's the same in terms of total moves.\n\nBut in terms of path, moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Let me think about the board again. The apple is at (8,8), which is y=8. I'm at y=7. So, moving UP to y=8 is one step towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to x=7, then x=8, and then UP to y=8. So, both paths require the same number of moves, but moving UP first might be more direct in terms of y-coordinate.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. That way, I'm making progress towards both x and y coordinates.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) is actually moving towards the top of the board, which is where the apple is. So, that makes sense. Then, moving right twice will get me to (8,8). That seems efficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first, I'm moving towards the apple's x-coordinate, but I'm still at y=7, so I have to move up after that. Either way, it's the same number of moves, but moving UP first might feel more direct.\n\nI think I'll stick with moving UP to (6,8) next. That way, I'm one step closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. It feels more efficient in terms of reducing the distance in both x and y.\n\nWait, but actually, the Manhattan distance is the same regardless of the order. So, maybe it doesn't matter. But I think moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's position.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If I move UP, I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is on the left side. So, that's safer. If I move RIGHT, I'm moving towards the right side, which is where the apple is, but also where the enemy snake isn't. So, both directions are safe.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP to (6,8) next. That way, I can then move right twice to reach the apple at (8,8). It seems like a solid plan.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the apple at (8,8) is at the top right, and the board's top right is (9,9). So, (8,8) is one step away from the top right corner. That might be a good spot to be in case I want to position myself for future moves.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, after eating (8,8), I can then move towards (4,5) or (8,3). But for now, focusing on the closest apple is the priority.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the enemy snake might intercept me. Since it's at (0,5), it's not in the same area, so unless it starts moving towards me, I shouldn't worry. But I should still keep an eye on its possible movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, I should aim to collect as many apples as possible without putting myself in danger. So, moving towards (8,8) seems like a good move. After that, I can plan my next steps.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) might be better because it's closer to the apple. Let me recalculate the distance. From (6,7) to (8,8) is 2 right and 1 up. If I move UP first, I'm at (6,8), then I need to move right twice. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT first, I'm at (7,7), then (8,7), then (8,8). That's also three moves. So, moving UP first is actually more efficient.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, maybe I should prioritize moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple in fewer moves.\n\nBut wait, I'm currently at (6,7). If I move UP to (6,8), that's one move. Then, from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then to (8,8). So, that's two moves after the first move. So, in total, three moves. Whereas, if I move RIGHT first, it's three moves as well. So, maybe it's the same in terms of total moves.\n\nBut in terms of path, moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Let me think about the board again. The apple is at (8,8), which is y=8. I'm at y=7. So, moving UP to y=8 is one step towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to x=7, then x=8, and then UP to y=8. So, both paths require the same number of moves, but moving UP first might be more direct in terms of y-coordinate.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. That way, I'm making progress towards both x and y coordinates.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) is actually moving towards the top of the board, which is where the apple is. So, that makes sense. Then, moving right twice will get me to (8,8). That seems efficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first, I'm moving towards the apple's x-coordinate, but I'm still at y=7, so I have to move up after that.

It feels more efficient in terms of reducing the distance in both x and y.\n\nWait, but actually, the Manhattan distance is the same regardless of the order. So, maybe it doesn't matter. But I think moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's position.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If I move UP, I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is on the left side. So, that's safer. If I move RIGHT, I'm moving towards the right side, which is where the apple is, but also where the enemy snake isn't. So, both directions are safe.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP to (6,8) next. That way, I can then move right twice to reach the apple at (8,8). It seems like a solid plan.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the apple at (8,8) is at the top right, and the board's top right is (9,9). So, (8,8) is one step away from the top right corner. That might be a good spot to be in case I want to position myself for future moves.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, after eating (8,8), I can then move towards (4,5) or (8,3). But for now, focusing on the closest apple is the priority.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the enemy snake might intercept me. Since it's at (0,5), it's not in the same area, so unless it starts moving towards me, I shouldn't worry. But I should still keep an eye on its possible movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, I should aim to collect as many apples as possible without putting myself in danger. So, moving towards (8,8) seems like a good move. After that, I can plan my next steps.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) might be better because it's closer to the apple. Let me recalculate the distance. From (6,7) to (8,8) is 2 right and 1 up. If I move UP first, I'm at (6,8), then I need to move right twice. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT first, I'm at (7,7), then (8,7), then (8,8). That's also three moves. So, moving UP first is actually more efficient.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, maybe I should prioritize moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple in fewer moves.\n\nBut wait, I'm currently at (6,7). If I move UP to (6,8), that's one move. Then, from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then to (8,8). So, that's two moves after the first move. So, in total, three moves. Whereas, if I move RIGHT first, it's three moves as well. So, maybe it's the same in terms of total moves.\n\nBut in terms of path, moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Let me think about the board again. The apple is at (8,8), which is y=8. I'm at y=7. So, moving UP to y=8 is one step towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to x=7, then x=8, and then UP to y=8. So, both paths require the same number of moves, but moving UP first might be more direct in terms of y-coordinate.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. That way, I'm making progress towards both x and y coordinates.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) is actually moving towards the top of the board, which is where the apple is.

From (6,7) to (8,8) is 2 right and 1 up. If I move UP first, I'm at (6,8), then I need to move right twice. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT first, I'm at (7,7), then (8,7), then (8,8). That's also three moves. So, moving UP first is actually more efficient.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, maybe I should prioritize moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple in fewer moves.\n\nBut wait, I'm currently at (6,7). If I move UP to (6,8), that's one move. Then, from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then to (8,8). So, that's two moves after the first move. So, in total, three moves. Whereas, if I move RIGHT first, it's three moves as well. So, maybe it's the same in terms of total moves.\n\nBut in terms of path, moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Let me think about the board again. The apple is at (8,8), which is y=8. I'm at y=7. So, moving UP to y=8 is one step towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to x=7, then x=8, and then UP to y=8. So, both paths require the same number of moves, but moving UP first might be more direct in terms of y-coordinate.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. That way, I'm making progress towards both x and y coordinates.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) is actually moving towards the top of the board, which is where the apple is. So, that makes sense. Then, moving right twice will get me to (8,8). That seems efficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first, I'm moving towards the apple's x-coordinate, but I'm still at y=7, so I have to move up after that. Either way, it's the same number of moves, but moving UP first might feel more direct.\n\nI think I'll stick with moving UP first because it's one step closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. It feels more efficient in terms of reducing the distance in both x and y.\n\nWait, but actually, the Manhattan distance is the same regardless of the order. So, maybe it doesn't matter. But I think moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's position.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If I move UP, I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is on the left side. So, that's safer. If I move RIGHT, I'm moving towards the right side, which is where the apple is, but also where the enemy snake isn't. So, both directions are safe.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP to (6,8) next. That way, I can then move right twice to reach the apple at (8,8). It seems like a solid plan.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the apple at (8,8) is at the top right, and the board's top right is (9,9). So, (8,8) is one step away from the top right corner. That might be a good spot to be in case I want to position myself for future moves.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, after eating (8,8), I can then move towards (4,5) or (8,3). But for now, focusing on the closest apple is the priority.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the enemy snake might intercept me. Since it's at (0,5), it's not in the same area, so unless it starts moving towards me, I shouldn't worry. But I should still keep an eye on its possible movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, I should aim to collect as many apples as possible without putting myself in danger. So, moving towards (8,8) seems like a good move. After that, I can plan my next steps.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) might be better because it's closer to the apple. Let me recalculate the distance.

Either way, it's the same number of moves, but moving UP first might feel more direct.\n\nI think I'll stick with moving UP first because it's one step closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. It feels more efficient in terms of reducing the distance in both x and y.\n\nWait, but actually, the Manhattan distance is the same regardless of the order. So, maybe it doesn't matter. But I think moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's position.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If I move UP, I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is on the left side. So, that's safer. If I move RIGHT, I'm moving towards the right side, which is where the apple is, but also where the enemy snake isn't. So, both directions are safe.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP to (6,8) next. That way, I can then move right twice to reach the apple at (8,8). It seems like a solid plan.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the apple at (8,8) is at the top right, and the board's top right is (9,9). So, (8,8) is one step away from the top right corner. That might be a good spot to be in case I want to position myself for future moves.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, after eating (8,8), I can then move towards (4,5) or (8,3). But for now, focusing on the closest apple is the priority.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the enemy snake might intercept me. Since it's at (0,5), it's not in the same area, so unless it starts moving towards me, I shouldn't worry. But I should still keep an eye on its possible movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, I should aim to collect as many apples as possible without putting myself in danger. So, moving towards (8,8) seems like a good move. After that, I can plan my next steps.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) might be better because it's closer to the apple. Let me recalculate the distance. From (6,7) to (8,8) is 2 right and 1 up. If I move UP first, I'm at (6,8), then I need to move right twice. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT first, I'm at (7,7), then (8,7), then (8,8). That's also three moves. So, moving UP first is actually more efficient.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, maybe I should prioritize moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple in fewer moves.\n\nBut wait, I'm currently at (6,7). If I move UP to (6,8), that's one move. Then, from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then to (8,8). So, that's two moves after the first move. So, in total, three moves. Whereas, if I move RIGHT first, it's three moves as well. So, maybe it's the same in terms of total moves.\n\nBut in terms of path, moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Let me think about the board again. The apple is at (8,8), which is y=8. I'm at y=7. So, moving UP to y=8 is one step towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to x=7, then x=8, and then UP to y=8. So, both paths require the same number of moves, but moving UP first might be more direct in terms of y-coordinate.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. That way, I'm making progress towards both x and y coordinates.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) is actually moving towards the top of the board, which is where the apple is.

From (6,7) to (8,8) is 2 right and 1 up. If I move UP first, I'm at (6,8), then I need to move right twice. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT first, I'm at (7,7), then (8,7), then (8,8). That's also three moves. So, moving UP first is actually more efficient.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, maybe I should prioritize moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple in fewer moves.\n\nBut wait, I'm currently at (6,7). If I move UP to (6,8), that's one move. Then, from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then to (8,8). So, that's two moves after the first move. So, in total, three moves. Whereas, if I move RIGHT first, it's three moves as well. So, maybe it's the same in terms of total moves.\n\nBut in terms of path, moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Let me think about the board again. The apple is at (8,8), which is y=8. I'm at y=7. So, moving UP to y=8 is one step towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to x=7, then x=8, and then UP to y=8. So, both paths require the same number of moves, but moving UP first might be more direct in terms of y-coordinate.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. That way, I'm making progress towards both x and y coordinates.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) is actually moving towards the top of the board, which is where the apple is. So, that makes sense. Then, moving right twice will get me to (8,8). That seems efficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first, I'm moving towards the apple's x-coordinate, but I'm still at y=7, so I have to move up after that. Either way, it's the same number of moves, but moving UP first might feel more direct.\n\nI think I'll stick with moving UP first because it's one step closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. It feels more efficient in terms of reducing the distance in both x and y.\n\nWait, but actually, the Manhattan distance is the same regardless of the order. So, maybe it doesn't matter. But I think moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's position.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If I move UP, I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is on the left side. So, that's safer. If I move RIGHT, I'm moving towards the right side, which is where the apple is, but also where the enemy snake isn't. So, both directions are safe.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP to (6,8) next. That way, I can then move right twice to reach the apple at (8,8). It seems like a solid plan.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the apple at (8,8) is at the top right, and the board's top right is (9,9). So, (8,8) is one step away from the top right corner. That might be a good spot to be in case I want to position myself for future moves.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, after eating (8,8), I can then move towards (4,5) or (8,3). But for now, focusing on the closest apple is the priority.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the enemy snake might intercept me. Since it's at (0,5), it's not in the same area, so unless it starts moving towards me, I shouldn't worry. But I should still keep an eye on its possible movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, I should aim to collect as many apples as possible without putting myself in danger. So, moving towards (8,8) seems like a good move. After that, I can plan my next steps.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) might be better because it's closer to the apple. Let me recalculate the distance.

Either way, it's the same number of moves, but moving UP first might feel more direct.\n\nI think I'll stick with moving UP first because it's one step closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. It feels more efficient in terms of reducing the distance in both x and y.\n\nWait, but actually, the Manhattan distance is the same regardless of the order. So, maybe it doesn't matter. But I think moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's position.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If I move UP, I'm moving away from the enemy snake, which is on the left side. So, that's safer. If I move RIGHT, I'm moving towards the right side, which is where the apple is, but also where the enemy snake isn't. So, both directions are safe.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP to (6,8) next. That way, I can then move right twice to reach the apple at (8,8). It seems like a solid plan.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the apple at (8,8) is at the top right, and the board's top right is (9,9). So, (8,8) is one step away from the top right corner. That might be a good spot to be in case I want to position myself for future moves.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, after eating (8,8), I can then move towards (4,5) or (8,3). But for now, focusing on the closest apple is the priority.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the enemy snake might intercept me. Since it's at (0,5), it's not in the same area, so unless it starts moving towards me, I shouldn't worry. But I should still keep an eye on its possible movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, I should aim to collect as many apples as possible without putting myself in danger. So, moving towards (8,8) seems like a good move. After that, I can plan my next steps.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) might be better because it's closer to the apple. Let me recalculate the distance. From (6,7) to (8,8) is 2 right and 1 up. If I move UP first, I'm at (6,8), then I need to move right twice. That's two moves. If I move RIGHT first, I'm at (7,7), then (8,7), then (8,8). That's also three moves. So, moving UP first is actually more efficient.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, maybe I should prioritize moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple in fewer moves.\n\nBut wait, I'm currently at (6,7). If I move UP to (6,8), that's one move. Then, from (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then to (8,8). So, that's two moves after the first move. So, in total, three moves. Whereas, if I move RIGHT first, it's three moves as well. So, maybe it's the same in terms of total moves.\n\nBut in terms of path, moving UP first might be better because it's closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Let me think about the board again. The apple is at (8,8), which is y=8. I'm at y=7. So, moving UP to y=8 is one step towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to x=7, then x=8, and then UP to y=8. So, both paths require the same number of moves, but moving UP first might be more direct in terms of y-coordinate.\n\nI think I'll go with moving UP first because it gets me closer to the apple's y-coordinate, and then I can move right twice. That way, I'm making progress towards both x and y coordinates.\n\nWait, but I just realized that moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) is actually moving towards the top of the board, which is where the apple is. So, that makes sense. Then, moving right twice will get me to (8,8). That seems efficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT first, I'm moving towards the apple's x-coordinate, but I'm still at y=7, so I have to move up after that.
