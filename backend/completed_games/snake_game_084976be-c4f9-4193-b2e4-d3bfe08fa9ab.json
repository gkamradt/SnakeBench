The apple at (3, 9) is directly to your right (at (1, 9)).\n3. Moving right to (2, 9) and then to (3, 9) would allow you to collect the apple at (3, 9) on your next move.\n4. After that, moving down would open more options toward (1, 1) later.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n- **UP (to (1, 10))**: This would move you outside of the board and is invalid.\n- **DOWN (to (1, 8))**: This moves you closer to the apple at (1, 1) but does not collect an apple.\n- **LEFT (to (0, 9))**: Invalid as it moves you away from the path to the apples.\n- **RIGHT (to (2, 9))**: This is a valid move that takes you closer to the apple at (3, 9).\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the objective is to maximize points and given the closest apple is at (3, 9), I should prioritize moving to positions that put me in line to collect apples efficiently, while also avoiding paths that lead to the enemy snake or restrict future moves.\n\nThus, I will move **RIGHT** to (2, 9), positioning me to reach the apple at (3, 9) next turn.\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"

The enemy snake is not a direct threat to my current position but is something to keep in mind for future moves.\n\n### Analyzing Potential Moves from (6, 5)\n\n1. **UP to (6, 6)**: This space is empty and open.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 4)**: This space is also empty.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 5)**: This would involve backtracking to my previous position, which is undesirable.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 5)**: This space is empty as well.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n- **UP (6, 6)**: Keeps me near the center of the board, but moves me away from apples that are primarily towards the left and bottom sides.\n- **DOWN (6, 4)**: This is a backward move in terms of positioning on the board, and it doesn\u2019t seem strategically beneficial.\n- **LEFT (5, 5)**: Not an option as it's backtracking.\n- **RIGHT (7, 5)**: This continues to keep me in the central path, while still being distant from apples.\n\n### Strategic Considerations for Next Move\nConsidering my current focus is on utilizing the moves to potentially gather apples:\n\n- **The left side (apples at (1, 1) and (0, 1))** is appealing, but there are significant distances to travel.\n- The **FEEDBACK from the right side** does not have any apples around it currently, but it offers space. \n- The **DOWN** move might not warrant progression towards apples at the moment, while **UP** may keep my options open in the short term without advancing towards the rewarded areas.\n\n### Final Decision\nAfter considering the available moves and the board state with the potential strategy of moving towards apples for growth, my best option appears to be moving **UP to (6, 6)**.
