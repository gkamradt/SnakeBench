Move DOWN to (7, 5):\n   * This move gets me the apple at (7, 5), and I gain 1 point\n   * It's a safe move as the enemy snake is far away\n3. Move LEFT to (6, 6):\n   * This move doesn't get me any apples\n   * It takes me one step closer to the apple at (4, 4)\n4. Move RIGHT to (8, 6):\n   * This move doesn't get me any apples\n   * It takes me towards the wall, which is risky\n\nThe best move seems to be DOWN, as it gets me the apple at (7, 5) and gains me 1 point, while also being a safe move away from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nAfter moving DOWN and eating the apple at (7, 5), I should consider going for the apple at (8, 1) or (4, 4), whichever is safer and more accessible. I'll need to be careful not to trap myself or run into the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: Assess the board and go for the apple at (8, 1) or (4, 4), whichever is safer and more accessible, while avoiding the enemy snake and trapping myself."
