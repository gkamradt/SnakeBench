          "2": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,7), which is the bottom right area. The apples are at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), (1,9). The enemy snake is at (8,9). My body is empty, so I'm just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left would take me to (8,7), which is empty. Moving up would go to (9,8), which is also empty. Moving down would be (9,6), but wait, the board's Y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving down from Y=7 would be Y=6. That's still within the board. But where are the apples?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,6) and (6,3). But from (9,7), moving left towards (8,7) and then further left might get me closer to (5,6). Alternatively, moving up to (9,8) and then left towards the apple at (3,9) in the top left. But (3,9) is pretty far. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. If I move down from (9,7) to (9,6), then left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., but that might take a while. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left towards (5,6). But maybe there's a quicker path.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,9). So if I move up to (9,8), then left to (8,8), that's near the enemy's position. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. I need to avoid colliding with them. If I go up, maybe they might move down towards (8,8) or (8,9) could stay there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,7) is safe. Then from there, I can go left again towards (7,7), etc. But the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. So maybe moving down first would get me closer. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nIf I move down to (9,6), that's one step closer to the apple at (5,6). Then from (9,6), moving left each time would get me to (5,6) in four moves. But that's a straight path. However, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) would also approach the apple. But maybe moving left first is better to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,9). So if I move left to (8,7), that's two rows below them. They might be moving towards the apple at (3,9) which is in the top left. So maybe they are heading left or down. If I move left, I can start moving towards the center where the apples are.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,8) might not be safe because the enemy is at (8,9). If I go up, then next move I could go left to (8,8), but the enemy could be moving down to (8,8) as well. That's a possible collision. So maybe moving up is risky.\n\nWhat about moving right? Wait, I'm at (9,7). Moving right would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's a wall. So right is invalid. So possible directions are left, up, or down.\n\nDown to (9,6) is safe. Then from there, left towards the apple. Let's see: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's four moves to reach the apple. But each move left would get me closer. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left. That's the same number of steps but maybe a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (8,7) and then up to (8,8) to approach the apple at (3,9). But that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top left. From (9,7), moving left and up would take a while, but maybe that's a safer path if the other apples are contested.\n\nBut the apple at (5,6) is closer. Let's check the positions again. The apple at (5,6) is at (5,6). So from (9,7), moving left and down would get me there. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is in the top right. So they might be going for the apple at (3,9) or (5,6). If I can reach (5,6) before them, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is at (6,3). That's lower down. Maybe moving down and left towards that. But that's further away. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. So the closest apples are (5,6) and (3,9). (5,6) is in the middle, (3,9) is top left.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT to (8,7): Safe. Then next moves can be left or down. From (8,7), moving down to (8,6) gets closer to (5,6). Then left again.\n\n2. DOWN to (9,6): Safe. Then left towards (8,6), etc.\n\n3. UP to (9,8): Safe, but then moving left towards (8,8) which is near the enemy's position. Risk of collision if enemy moves down.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), next move could be DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc. That path is safe. Alternatively, going DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT each time. Both paths are similar in steps. But moving LEFT first might allow more flexibility. Also, moving LEFT first gets me away from the edge, which is safer in case I need to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer to the apple at (5,6) in the Y-axis. Let's count steps:\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6). That's 5 moves. Wait, but the apple is at (5,6). So from (9,7) to (5,6) is 4 steps left and 1 down. Wait, no. Let me calculate the distance. The X difference is 9-5=4, Y difference is 7-6=1. So total steps would be 4 left and 1 down. So 5 steps. But if I move down first to (9,6), then left 4 times: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut moving left first might allow me to approach other apples if needed. Alternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple in Y direction. Hmm.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,9). If they move towards (5,6), they might take a path down and left. For example, from (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then left to (7,8), etc. But that's a longer path. So maybe I can reach (5,6) before them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (3,9). So they might move left from (8,9) to (7,9), then (6,9), etc. So perhaps they are not a threat for the (5,6) apple.\n\nIn that case, moving towards (5,6) is safe. So which direction first? LEFT or DOWN.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7) is moving towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is moving towards the bottom. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. So moving left first might be better to get into the center where there are more options.\n\nBut also, if I move LEFT, I need to make sure that the next moves are possible. For example, after moving left to (8,7), next move could be LEFT again to (7,7), but that's not getting me closer to the apple. Wait, no. The apple is at (5,6). So from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) is better. Then left to (7,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (9,6), then left each time. Either way, same steps. So maybe the first move is a matter of which path is safer.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,9). If I move left to (8,7), that's two steps below them. They might move down towards (8,8), but that's still not a collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,6) is also safe. So both directions are safe. Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

The apples are still at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), and (1,9). The enemy snake is at (7,9) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the next direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple now is (5,6), which is at (5,6). From my current position (8,7), moving left would take me to (7,7), moving down to (8,6), or moving up to (8,8). Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,7):** This continues moving towards the center. From there, I can proceed left again towards (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on. However, this path might take longer to reach (5,6) compared to moving down first.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** This directly reduces the Y-coordinate, bringing me closer to the apple at (5,6). From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), and finally (5,6) would be a straight path. This seems efficient.\n\n3. **UP to (8,8):** Moving up would take me away from the apple at (5,6) and closer to the enemy snake at (7,9). This might be risky if the enemy moves towards me. Also, there's an apple at (3,9) in that direction, but it's farther away.\n\nConsidering efficiency, moving down to (8,6) seems better as it shortens the distance to the apple. Checking for safety: the enemy is at (7,9). Their possible moves are left to (6,9), down to (7,8), or right to (8,9). None of these positions interfere with my path to (8,6). Therefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples closer now? The apple at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is further down. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. The apple at (1,9) is far left but in the top row. The apple at (3,9) is also in the top left. Since (5,6) is the closest, focusing on that is optimal.\n\nNext, check if moving down leads into any immediate danger. The position (8,6) is empty according to the board state. The enemy snake is at (7,9), so their movement won't affect this path immediately. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,6), getting closer to the apple at (5,6) efficiently and safely.\n</think>\n\nDirection: DOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,7), which is the bottom right area. The apples are at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), (1,9). The enemy snake is at (8,9). My body is empty, so I'm just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left would take me to (8,7), which is empty. Moving up would go to (9,8), which is also empty. Moving down would be (9,6), but wait, the board's Y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving down from Y=7 would be Y=6. That's still within the board. But where are the apples?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,6) and (6,3). But from (9,7), moving left towards (8,7) and then further left might get me closer to (5,6). Alternatively, moving up to (9,8) and then left towards the apple at (3,9) in the top left. But (3,9) is pretty far. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. If I move down from (9,7) to (9,6), then left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., but that might take a while. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left towards (5,6). But maybe there's a quicker path.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,9). So if I move up to (9,8), then left to (8,8), that's near the enemy's position. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. I need to avoid colliding with them. If I go up, maybe they might move down towards (8,8) or (8,9) could stay there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,7) is safe. Then from there, I can go left again towards (7,7), etc. But the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. So maybe moving down first would get me closer. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nIf I move down to (9,6), that's one step closer to the apple at (5,6). Then from (9,6), moving left each time would get me to (5,6) in four moves. But that's a straight path. However, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) would also approach the apple. But maybe moving left first is better to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,9). So if I move left to (8,7), that's two rows below them. They might be moving towards the apple at (3,9) which is in the top left. So maybe they are heading left or down. If I move left, I can start moving towards the center where the apples are.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,8) might not be safe because the enemy is at (8,9). If I go up, then next move I could go left to (8,8), but the enemy could be moving down to (8,8) as well. That's a possible collision. So maybe moving up is risky.\n\nWhat about moving right? Wait, I'm at (9,7). Moving right would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's a wall. So right is invalid. So possible directions are left, up, or down.\n\nDown to (9,6) is safe. Then from there, left towards the apple. Let's see: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's four moves to reach the apple. But each move left would get me closer. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left. That's the same number of steps but maybe a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (8,7) and then up to (8,8) to approach the apple at (3,9). But that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top left. From (9,7), moving left and up would take a while, but maybe that's a safer path if the other apples are contested.\n\nBut the apple at (5,6) is closer. Let's check the positions again. The apple at (5,6) is at (5,6). So from (9,7), moving left and down would get me there. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is in the top right. So they might be going for the apple at (3,9) or (5,6). If I can reach (5,6) before them, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is at (6,3). That's lower down. Maybe moving down and left towards that. But that's further away. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. So the closest apples are (5,6) and (3,9). (5,6) is in the middle, (3,9) is top left.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT to (8,7): Safe. Then next moves can be left or down. From (8,7), moving down to (8,6) gets closer to (5,6). Then left again.\n\n2. DOWN to (9,6): Safe. Then left towards (8,6), etc.\n\n3. UP to (9,8): Safe, but then moving left towards (8,8) which is near the enemy's position. Risk of collision if enemy moves down.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), next move could be DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc. That path is safe. Alternatively, going DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT each time. Both paths are similar in steps. But moving LEFT first might allow more flexibility. Also, moving LEFT first gets me away from the edge, which is safer in case I need to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer to the apple at (5,6) in the Y-axis. Let's count steps:\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6). That's 5 moves. Wait, but the apple is at (5,6). So from (9,7) to (5,6) is 4 steps left and 1 down. Wait, no. Let me calculate the distance. The X difference is 9-5=4, Y difference is 7-6=1. So total steps would be 4 left and 1 down. So 5 steps. But if I move down first to (9,6), then left 4 times: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut moving left first might allow me to approach other apples if needed. Alternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple in Y direction. Hmm.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,9). If they move towards (5,6), they might take a path down and left. For example, from (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then left to (7,8), etc. But that's a longer path. So maybe I can reach (5,6) before them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (3,9). So they might move left from (8,9) to (7,9), then (6,9), etc. So perhaps they are not a threat for the (5,6) apple.\n\nIn that case, moving towards (5,6) is safe. So which direction first? LEFT or DOWN.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7) is moving towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is moving towards the bottom. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. So moving left first might be better to get into the center where there are more options.\n\nBut also, if I move LEFT, I need to make sure that the next moves are possible. For example, after moving left to (8,7), next move could be LEFT again to (7,7), but that's not getting me closer to the apple. Wait, no. The apple is at (5,6). So from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) is better. Then left to (7,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (9,6), then left each time. Either way, same steps. So maybe the first move is a matter of which path is safer.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,9). If I move left to (8,7), that's two steps below them. They might move down towards (8,8), but that's still not a collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,6) is also safe. So both directions are safe. Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the next direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple now is (5,6), which is at (5,6). From my current position (8,7), moving left would take me to (7,7), moving down to (8,6), or moving up to (8,8). Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,7):** This continues moving towards the center. From there, I can proceed left again towards (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on. However, this path might take longer to reach (5,6) compared to moving down first.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** This directly reduces the Y-coordinate, bringing me closer to the apple at (5,6). From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), and finally (5,6) would be a straight path.

So moving left would get me closer. Let's check possible directions:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,6):** This is a safe move. The next step would be to (6,6), then (5,6) to get the apple. No immediate obstacles here. The enemy is at (6,9), which is three units up from (6,6), so they might not interfere immediately.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,5):** Moving down would take me away from the apple.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,7), which is the bottom right area. The apples are at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), (1,9). The enemy snake is at (8,9). My body is empty, so I'm just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left would take me to (8,7), which is empty. Moving up would go to (9,8), which is also empty. Moving down would be (9,6), but wait, the board's Y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving down from Y=7 would be Y=6. That's still within the board. But where are the apples?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,6) and (6,3). But from (9,7), moving left towards (8,7) and then further left might get me closer to (5,6). Alternatively, moving up to (9,8) and then left towards the apple at (3,9) in the top left. But (3,9) is pretty far. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. If I move down from (9,7) to (9,6), then left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., but that might take a while. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left towards (5,6). But maybe there's a quicker path.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,9). So if I move up to (9,8), then left to (8,8), that's near the enemy's position. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. I need to avoid colliding with them. If I go up, maybe they might move down towards (8,8) or (8,9) could stay there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,7) is safe. Then from there, I can go left again towards (7,7), etc. But the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. So maybe moving down first would get me closer. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nIf I move down to (9,6), that's one step closer to the apple at (5,6). Then from (9,6), moving left each time would get me to (5,6) in four moves. But that's a straight path. However, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) would also approach the apple. But maybe moving left first is better to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,9). So if I move left to (8,7), that's two rows below them. They might be moving towards the apple at (3,9) which is in the top left. So maybe they are heading left or down. If I move left, I can start moving towards the center where the apples are.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,8) might not be safe because the enemy is at (8,9). If I go up, then next move I could go left to (8,8), but the enemy could be moving down to (8,8) as well. That's a possible collision. So maybe moving up is risky.\n\nWhat about moving right? Wait, I'm at (9,7). Moving right would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's a wall. So right is invalid. So possible directions are left, up, or down.\n\nDown to (9,6) is safe. Then from there, left towards the apple. Let's see: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's four moves to reach the apple. But each move left would get me closer. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left. That's the same number of steps but maybe a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (8,7) and then up to (8,8) to approach the apple at (3,9). But that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top left. From (9,7), moving left and up would take a while, but maybe that's a safer path if the other apples are contested.\n\nBut the apple at (5,6) is closer. Let's check the positions again. The apple at (5,6) is at (5,6). So from (9,7), moving left and down would get me there. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is in the top right. So they might be going for the apple at (3,9) or (5,6). If I can reach (5,6) before them, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is at (6,3). That's lower down. Maybe moving down and left towards that. But that's further away. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. So the closest apples are (5,6) and (3,9). (5,6) is in the middle, (3,9) is top left.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT to (8,7): Safe. Then next moves can be left or down. From (8,7), moving down to (8,6) gets closer to (5,6). Then left again.\n\n2. DOWN to (9,6): Safe. Then left towards (8,6), etc.\n\n3. UP to (9,8): Safe, but then moving left towards (8,8) which is near the enemy's position. Risk of collision if enemy moves down.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), next move could be DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc. That path is safe. Alternatively, going DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT each time. Both paths are similar in steps. But moving LEFT first might allow more flexibility. Also, moving LEFT first gets me away from the edge, which is safer in case I need to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer to the apple at (5,6) in the Y-axis. Let's count steps:\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6). That's 5 moves. Wait, but the apple is at (5,6). So from (9,7) to (5,6) is 4 steps left and 1 down. Wait, no. Let me calculate the distance. The X difference is 9-5=4, Y difference is 7-6=1. So total steps would be 4 left and 1 down. So 5 steps. But if I move down first to (9,6), then left 4 times: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut moving left first might allow me to approach other apples if needed. Alternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple in Y direction. Hmm.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,9). If they move towards (5,6), they might take a path down and left. For example, from (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then left to (7,8), etc. But that's a longer path. So maybe I can reach (5,6) before them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (3,9). So they might move left from (8,9) to (7,9), then (6,9), etc. So perhaps they are not a threat for the (5,6) apple.\n\nIn that case, moving towards (5,6) is safe. So which direction first? LEFT or DOWN.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7) is moving towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is moving towards the bottom. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. So moving left first might be better to get into the center where there are more options.\n\nBut also, if I move LEFT, I need to make sure that the next moves are possible. For example, after moving left to (8,7), next move could be LEFT again to (7,7), but that's not getting me closer to the apple. Wait, no. The apple is at (5,6). So from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) is better. Then left to (7,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (9,6), then left each time. Either way, same steps. So maybe the first move is a matter of which path is safer.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,9). If I move left to (8,7), that's two steps below them. They might move down towards (8,8), but that's still not a collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,6) is also safe. So both directions are safe. Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

The apples are still at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), and (1,9). The enemy snake is at (7,9) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the next direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple now is (5,6), which is at (5,6). From my current position (8,7), moving left would take me to (7,7), moving down to (8,6), or moving up to (8,8). Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,7):** This continues moving towards the center. From there, I can proceed left again towards (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on. However, this path might take longer to reach (5,6) compared to moving down first.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** This directly reduces the Y-coordinate, bringing me closer to the apple at (5,6). From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), and finally (5,6) would be a straight path. This seems efficient.\n\n3. **UP to (8,8):** Moving up would take me away from the apple at (5,6) and closer to the enemy snake at (7,9). This might be risky if the enemy moves towards me. Also, there's an apple at (3,9) in that direction, but it's farther away.\n\nConsidering efficiency, moving down to (8,6) seems better as it shortens the distance to the apple. Checking for safety: the enemy is at (7,9). Their possible moves are left to (6,9), down to (7,8), or right to (8,9). None of these positions interfere with my path to (8,6). Therefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples closer now? The apple at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is further down. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. The apple at (1,9) is far left but in the top row. The apple at (3,9) is also in the top left. Since (5,6) is the closest, focusing on that is optimal.\n\nNext, check if moving down leads into any immediate danger. The position (8,6) is empty according to the board state. The enemy snake is at (7,9), so their movement won't affect this path immediately. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,6), getting closer to the apple at (5,6) efficiently and safely.\n</think>\n\nDirection: DOWN"

So moving left would get me closer. Let's check possible directions:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,6):** This is a safe move. The next step would be to (6,6), then (5,6) to get the apple. No immediate obstacles here. The enemy is at (6,9), which is three units up from (6,6), so they might not interfere immediately.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,5):** Moving down would take me away from the apple. Not ideal unless avoiding danger, but there's no danger here.\n\n3. **UP to (8,7):** That's backtracking.

If I go up, then next move I could go left to (8,8), but the enemy could be moving down to (8,8) as well. That's a possible collision. So maybe moving up is risky.\n\nWhat about moving right? Wait, I'm at (9,7). Moving right would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's a wall. So right is invalid. So possible directions are left, up, or down.\n\nDown to (9,6) is safe. Then from there, left towards the apple. Let's see: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's four moves to reach the apple. But each move left would get me closer. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left. That's the same number of steps but maybe a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (8,7) and then up to (8,8) to approach the apple at (3,9). But that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top left. From (9,7), moving left and up would take a while, but maybe that's a safer path if the other apples are contested.\n\nBut the apple at (5,6) is closer. Let's check the positions again. The apple at (5,6) is at (5,6). So from (9,7), moving left and down would get me there. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is in the top right. So they might be going for the apple at (3,9) or (5,6). If I can reach (5,6) before them, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is at (6,3). That's lower down. Maybe moving down and left towards that. But that's further away. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. So the closest apples are (5,6) and (3,9). (5,6) is in the middle, (3,9) is top left.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT to (8,7): Safe. Then next moves can be left or down. From (8,7), moving down to (8,6) gets closer to (5,6). Then left again.\n\n2. DOWN to (9,6): Safe. Then left towards (8,6), etc.\n\n3. UP to (9,8): Safe, but then moving left towards (8,8) which is near the enemy's position. Risk of collision if enemy moves down.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), next move could be DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc. That path is safe. Alternatively, going DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT each time. Both paths are similar in steps. But moving LEFT first might allow more flexibility. Also, moving LEFT first gets me away from the edge, which is safer in case I need to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer to the apple at (5,6) in the Y-axis. Let's count steps:\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6). That's 5 moves. Wait, but the apple is at (5,6). So from (9,7) to (5,6) is 4 steps left and 1 down. Wait, no. Let me calculate the distance. The X difference is 9-5=4, Y difference is 7-6=1. So total steps would be 4 left and 1 down. So 5 steps. But if I move down first to (9,6), then left 4 times: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut moving left first might allow me to approach other apples if needed. Alternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple in Y direction. Hmm.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,9). If they move towards (5,6), they might take a path down and left. For example, from (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then left to (7,8), etc. But that's a longer path. So maybe I can reach (5,6) before them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (3,9). So they might move left from (8,9) to (7,9), then (6,9), etc. So perhaps they are not a threat for the (5,6) apple.\n\nIn that case, moving towards (5,6) is safe. So which direction first? LEFT or DOWN.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7) is moving towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is moving towards the bottom. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. So moving left first might be better to get into the center where there are more options.\n\nBut also, if I move LEFT, I need to make sure that the next moves are possible. For example, after moving left to (8,7), next move could be LEFT again to (7,7), but that's not getting me closer to the apple. Wait, no. The apple is at (5,6). So from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) is better. Then left to (7,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (9,6), then left each time. Either way, same steps. So maybe the first move is a matter of which path is safer.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,9). If I move left to (8,7), that's two steps below them. They might move down towards (8,8), but that's still not a collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,6) is also safe. So both directions are safe. Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the next direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple now is (5,6), which is at (5,6). From my current position (8,7), moving left would take me to (7,7), moving down to (8,6), or moving up to (8,8). Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,7):** This continues moving towards the center. From there, I can proceed left again towards (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on. However, this path might take longer to reach (5,6) compared to moving down first.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** This directly reduces the Y-coordinate, bringing me closer to the apple at (5,6). From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), and finally (5,6) would be a straight path. This seems efficient.\n\n3. **UP to (8,8):** Moving up would take me away from the apple at (5,6) and closer to the enemy snake at (7,9). This might be risky if the enemy moves towards me. Also, there's an apple at (3,9) in that direction, but it's farther away.\n\nConsidering efficiency, moving down to (8,6) seems better as it shortens the distance to the apple. Checking for safety: the enemy is at (7,9). Their possible moves are left to (6,9), down to (7,8), or right to (8,9). None of these positions interfere with my path to (8,6). Therefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples closer now? The apple at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is further down. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. The apple at (1,9) is far left but in the top row. The apple at (3,9) is also in the top left. Since (5,6) is the closest, focusing on that is optimal.\n\nNext, check if moving down leads into any immediate danger. The position (8,6) is empty according to the board state. The enemy snake is at (7,9), so their movement won't affect this path immediately. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,6), getting closer to the apple at (5,6) efficiently and safely.\n</think>\n\nDirection: DOWN"

But since I just ate the apple, my body will start growing. Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (5,6), the next move will have the body segment at (6,6). So if I move left again, the body follows. So next turn, I need to avoid moving right back to (6,6) because that's where my body will be. \n\nBut for this current move, moving left is safe and gets the apple.

My body is empty, so I'm just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left would take me to (8,7), which is empty. Moving up would go to (9,8), which is also empty. Moving down would be (9,6), but wait, the board's Y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving down from Y=7 would be Y=6. That's still within the board. But where are the apples?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,6) and (6,3). But from (9,7), moving left towards (8,7) and then further left might get me closer to (5,6). Alternatively, moving up to (9,8) and then left towards the apple at (3,9) in the top left. But (3,9) is pretty far. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. If I move down from (9,7) to (9,6), then left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., but that might take a while. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left towards (5,6). But maybe there's a quicker path.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,9). So if I move up to (9,8), then left to (8,8), that's near the enemy's position. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. I need to avoid colliding with them. If I go up, maybe they might move down towards (8,8) or (8,9) could stay there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,7) is safe. Then from there, I can go left again towards (7,7), etc. But the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. So maybe moving down first would get me closer. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nIf I move down to (9,6), that's one step closer to the apple at (5,6). Then from (9,6), moving left each time would get me to (5,6) in four moves. But that's a straight path. However, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) would also approach the apple. But maybe moving left first is better to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,9). So if I move left to (8,7), that's two rows below them. They might be moving towards the apple at (3,9) which is in the top left. So maybe they are heading left or down. If I move left, I can start moving towards the center where the apples are.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,8) might not be safe because the enemy is at (8,9). If I go up, then next move I could go left to (8,8), but the enemy could be moving down to (8,8) as well. That's a possible collision. So maybe moving up is risky.\n\nWhat about moving right? Wait, I'm at (9,7). Moving right would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's a wall. So right is invalid. So possible directions are left, up, or down.\n\nDown to (9,6) is safe. Then from there, left towards the apple. Let's see: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's four moves to reach the apple. But each move left would get me closer. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left. That's the same number of steps but maybe a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (8,7) and then up to (8,8) to approach the apple at (3,9). But that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top left. From (9,7), moving left and up would take a while, but maybe that's a safer path if the other apples are contested.\n\nBut the apple at (5,6) is closer. Let's check the positions again. The apple at (5,6) is at (5,6). So from (9,7), moving left and down would get me there. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is in the top right. So they might be going for the apple at (3,9) or (5,6). If I can reach (5,6) before them, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is at (6,3). That's lower down. Maybe moving down and left towards that. But that's further away. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. So the closest apples are (5,6) and (3,9). (5,6) is in the middle, (3,9) is top left.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT to (8,7): Safe. Then next moves can be left or down. From (8,7), moving down to (8,6) gets closer to (5,6). Then left again.\n\n2. DOWN to (9,6): Safe. Then left towards (8,6), etc.\n\n3. UP to (9,8): Safe, but then moving left towards (8,8) which is near the enemy's position. Risk of collision if enemy moves down.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), next move could be DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc. That path is safe. Alternatively, going DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT each time. Both paths are similar in steps. But moving LEFT first might allow more flexibility. Also, moving LEFT first gets me away from the edge, which is safer in case I need to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer to the apple at (5,6) in the Y-axis. Let's count steps:\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6). That's 5 moves. Wait, but the apple is at (5,6). So from (9,7) to (5,6) is 4 steps left and 1 down. Wait, no. Let me calculate the distance. The X difference is 9-5=4, Y difference is 7-6=1. So total steps would be 4 left and 1 down. So 5 steps. But if I move down first to (9,6), then left 4 times: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut moving left first might allow me to approach other apples if needed. Alternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple in Y direction. Hmm.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,9). If they move towards (5,6), they might take a path down and left. For example, from (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then left to (7,8), etc. But that's a longer path. So maybe I can reach (5,6) before them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (3,9). So they might move left from (8,9) to (7,9), then (6,9), etc. So perhaps they are not a threat for the (5,6) apple.\n\nIn that case, moving towards (5,6) is safe. So which direction first? LEFT or DOWN.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7) is moving towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is moving towards the bottom. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. So moving left first might be better to get into the center where there are more options.\n\nBut also, if I move LEFT, I need to make sure that the next moves are possible. For example, after moving left to (8,7), next move could be LEFT again to (7,7), but that's not getting me closer to the apple. Wait, no. The apple is at (5,6). So from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) is better. Then left to (7,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (9,6), then left each time. Either way, same steps. So maybe the first move is a matter of which path is safer.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,9). If I move left to (8,7), that's two steps below them. They might move down towards (8,8), but that's still not a collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,6) is also safe. So both directions are safe. Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

The apples are still at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), and (1,9). The enemy snake is at (7,9) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the next direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple now is (5,6), which is at (5,6). From my current position (8,7), moving left would take me to (7,7), moving down to (8,6), or moving up to (8,8). Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,7):** This continues moving towards the center. From there, I can proceed left again towards (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on. However, this path might take longer to reach (5,6) compared to moving down first.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** This directly reduces the Y-coordinate, bringing me closer to the apple at (5,6). From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), and finally (5,6) would be a straight path. This seems efficient.\n\n3. **UP to (8,8):** Moving up would take me away from the apple at (5,6) and closer to the enemy snake at (7,9). This might be risky if the enemy moves towards me. Also, there's an apple at (3,9) in that direction, but it's farther away.\n\nConsidering efficiency, moving down to (8,6) seems better as it shortens the distance to the apple. Checking for safety: the enemy is at (7,9). Their possible moves are left to (6,9), down to (7,8), or right to (8,9). None of these positions interfere with my path to (8,6). Therefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples closer now? The apple at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is further down. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. The apple at (1,9) is far left but in the top row. The apple at (3,9) is also in the top left. Since (5,6) is the closest, focusing on that is optimal.\n\nNext, check if moving down leads into any immediate danger. The position (8,6) is empty according to the board state. The enemy snake is at (7,9), so their movement won't affect this path immediately. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,6), getting closer to the apple at (5,6) efficiently and safely.\n</think>\n\nDirection: DOWN"

From (6,6), possible moves are LEFT to (5,6), RIGHT to (7,6), UP to (6,7), or DOWN to (6,5). \n\nThe apple at (5,6) is directly to the left. Moving LEFT would get me there, eat the apple, and grow.

But since I just ate the apple, my body will start growing. Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (5,6), the next move will have the body segment at (6,6). So if I move left again, the body follows. So next turn, I need to avoid moving right back to (6,6) because that's where my body will be. \n\nBut for this current move, moving left is safe and gets the apple.

But in the board diagram, there's an 'A' at (5,6) in row 6, which is the current position of my snake's head. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state shows row 6 as: 6 . . . . . 2 T A . . So at (5,6) (x=5, y=6) is the snake's head (2), then T (tail?) at (6,6), and an apple (A) at (7,6). Wait, the coordinates are (x,y) where x is the horizontal (columns 0-9) and y is vertical (rows 0-9). So row 6 (y=6) has columns 0-9. The row is written as: 6 . . . . . 2 T A . . So positions (5,6) is snake 2's head, (6,6) is T (tail?), and (7,6) is an apple (A). So the apple at (7,6) is to the right of my current position. But in the initial list, the apples are at (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0). So the apple at (7,6) is present. \n\nWait, but my current position is (5,6) with body at [(6,6)]. So after moving left from (6,6) to (5,6) in the last move, the apple at (7,6) is still there. So now, my head is at (5,6), body at (6,6). The apples available are (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0). \n\nSo the closest apple is (7,6), which is two steps to the right. But moving right from (5,6) would take me to (6,6), which is my own body. That's a collision. So I can't go right. \n\nOther apples: (6,3) is at y=3, so three down from my current y=6. (5,1) is further down. (1,9) is top left. (2,0) is bottom. \n\nSo possible directions from (5,6): \n\n- UP: (5,7). Check if there's anything there. The board shows row 7 as all dots except for (7,6) which is the apple. So (5,7) is empty. \n\n- DOWN: (5,5). Also empty. \n\n- LEFT: (4,6). Empty. \n\n- RIGHT: (6,6) which is my body. So invalid. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (7,6) is to the right, but that's blocked. The next closest apple is (6,3) at (6,3). To get there from (5,6), I need to move down and right. But moving right is blocked. So maybe go down first. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,1) is directly below. From (5,6) to (5,1) is 5 steps down. But that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,0) is at the bottom left. That's even further. \n\nThe apple at (1,9) is top left, but enemy snake #1 is at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]. So that area might be risky. \n\nSo the nearest accessible apple is (6,3). To reach (6,3), I need to go down from (5,6) to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). But that's three moves. Alternatively, maybe go left to (4,6), then down, but that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right towards (7,6) once possible. But after moving up, next move could be right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). But that's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as my current position, but blocked by my own tail. So maybe I need to find a path around. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6), then down towards (4,5), etc. \n\nBut perhaps the safest immediate move is to go down towards (5,5), avoiding any immediate danger and moving towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nWait, but moving down from (5,6) to (5,5) is safe. Then next move could be right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) and then down. But that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7) to explore the upper area. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake at (3,9), which is far away, maybe not a threat right now. \n\nSo the priority is to reach an apple without colliding. The closest accessible apple is (6,3). So moving down towards that direction. \n\nBut first, check if moving down is safe. From (5,6) to (5,5). The board shows row 5 as all dots except for (5,1) which is an apple. So (5,5) is empty. \n\nSo moving DOWN to (5,5) is safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then proceeding. \n\nBut which direction gives the best path? \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), etc., but that's moving away from the apple at (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but that's moving towards the apple at (7,6). However, after moving up, the next move to the right would be (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6). But that's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as my current position but blocked by my tail. So perhaps that's not the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then proceeding left or down. \n\nBut perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the apple at (6,3) by moving down. \n\nSo the possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or UP. \n\nWhich is the best? \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,5), that's safe. Then next move can be RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down. \n\nBut moving down seems more direct. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's moving away from the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row, but blocked. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (5,1) is a long-term goal. \n\nBut given the options, moving DOWN towards (6,3) seems better. \n\nSo the immediate move is DOWN. \n\nWait, but after moving down to (5,5), the next move would be to (5,4), then (5,3), etc., but that's not towards (6,3). Wait, no. To reach (6,3), I need to move right from (5,5) to (6,5), then down. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the only way to get to (6,3) is to first move down, then right. \n\nSo moving DOWN now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down. \n\nBut that's moving away from the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right. \n\nBut that's moving towards the apple at (7,6), but after moving up, the next move right would be (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, after moving up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, after moving up to (5,7), then up again to (5,8), etc. \n\nBut that's not helpful. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Moving DOWN towards (6,3) \n\n- Moving LEFT to (4,6) \n\n- Moving UP to (5,7) \n\nWhich is the best? \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three moves away if I go down now. \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is three moves away if I go up and then right. \n\nThe apple at (5,1) is five moves down. \n\nThe apple at (2,0) is far. \n\nThe apple at (1,9) is far and near enemy snake. \n\nSo between (6,3) and (7,6), which is better? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can reach it. But currently, moving right is blocked by my own tail. \n\nSo perhaps the best path is to move up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). That's three moves. \n\nSo both apples are three moves away. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nIf I move up, the path is (5,7) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 (7,6). \n\nBut after moving up, the next move to (6,7) is safe. Then to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut during that time, other snakes might take the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down towards (6,3). \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, from (5,6) to (7,6) is two steps right, but blocked by my tail. So I need to go around. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6), then up to (4,7), then right to (5,7), then right to (6,7), etc. That's longer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nSo that's another path. \n\nSo from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nBut that's the same as the other path. \n\nSo both apples are three moves away. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nThe path to (7,6) requires moving through (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6). \n\nThe path to (6,3) requires moving through (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,6) is more urgent because it's in the same row but blocked. \n\nBut given that I can't move right now to (6,6), I need to find a way around. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving left to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's moving away from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go down to (5,5) to start heading towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) to explore other areas. \n\nBut without knowing the future moves, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving down to (5,5), my body will be at (5,6) and (6,6). So next move, I can't go back up to (5,6). \n\nBut that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) would leave my body at (5,6) and (6,6). \n\nSo either way, the body is following. \n\nSo which direction gives the best path towards an apple? \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three moves away if I go down now. \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is three moves away if I go up now. \n\nBut which path is less likely to be blocked by other snakes or myself? \n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,9), which is far away. So probably not a threat. \n\nSo both paths are safe. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can reach it. \n\nBut moving up now to (5,7) and then right. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5) and then right. \n\nBut which path is shorter? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is two steps right from (5,6), but blocked. \n\nThe path via up is three steps. \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three steps down and right. \n\nSo both are three steps. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is more urgent because it's in the same row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake #1 is moving towards (1,9), but that's not near. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go down to (5,5) to start moving towards (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) to avoid potential collisions. \n\nBut moving left doesn't directly help towards any apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7) to start the path towards (7,6). \n\nBut I need to choose between these options. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating an apple, the snake grows. So if I can reach an apple in three moves, I can grow and have more body segments. \n\nBut which apple is safer to go for? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is in the same row but requires a detour. \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is down and right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,1) is a long-term goal. \n\nBut given the current options, I think moving down to (5,5) is a safe move towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,7), which is the bottom right area. The apples are at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), (1,9). The enemy snake is at (8,9). My body is empty, so I'm just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left would take me to (8,7), which is empty. Moving up would go to (9,8), which is also empty. Moving down would be (9,6), but wait, the board's Y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving down from Y=7 would be Y=6. That's still within the board. But where are the apples?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,6) and (6,3). But from (9,7), moving left towards (8,7) and then further left might get me closer to (5,6). Alternatively, moving up to (9,8) and then left towards the apple at (3,9) in the top left. But (3,9) is pretty far. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. If I move down from (9,7) to (9,6), then left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., but that might take a while. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left towards (5,6). But maybe there's a quicker path.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,9). So if I move up to (9,8), then left to (8,8), that's near the enemy's position. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. I need to avoid colliding with them. If I go up, maybe they might move down towards (8,8) or (8,9) could stay there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,7) is safe. Then from there, I can go left again towards (7,7), etc. But the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. So maybe moving down first would get me closer. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nIf I move down to (9,6), that's one step closer to the apple at (5,6). Then from (9,6), moving left each time would get me to (5,6) in four moves. But that's a straight path. However, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) would also approach the apple. But maybe moving left first is better to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,9). So if I move left to (8,7), that's two rows below them. They might be moving towards the apple at (3,9) which is in the top left. So maybe they are heading left or down. If I move left, I can start moving towards the center where the apples are.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,8) might not be safe because the enemy is at (8,9). If I go up, then next move I could go left to (8,8), but the enemy could be moving down to (8,8) as well. That's a possible collision. So maybe moving up is risky.\n\nWhat about moving right? Wait, I'm at (9,7). Moving right would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's a wall. So right is invalid. So possible directions are left, up, or down.\n\nDown to (9,6) is safe. Then from there, left towards the apple. Let's see: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's four moves to reach the apple. But each move left would get me closer. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left. That's the same number of steps but maybe a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (8,7) and then up to (8,8) to approach the apple at (3,9). But that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top left. From (9,7), moving left and up would take a while, but maybe that's a safer path if the other apples are contested.\n\nBut the apple at (5,6) is closer. Let's check the positions again. The apple at (5,6) is at (5,6). So from (9,7), moving left and down would get me there. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is in the top right. So they might be going for the apple at (3,9) or (5,6). If I can reach (5,6) before them, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is at (6,3). That's lower down. Maybe moving down and left towards that. But that's further away. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. So the closest apples are (5,6) and (3,9). (5,6) is in the middle, (3,9) is top left.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT to (8,7): Safe. Then next moves can be left or down. From (8,7), moving down to (8,6) gets closer to (5,6). Then left again.\n\n2. DOWN to (9,6): Safe. Then left towards (8,6), etc.\n\n3. UP to (9,8): Safe, but then moving left towards (8,8) which is near the enemy's position. Risk of collision if enemy moves down.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), next move could be DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc. That path is safe. Alternatively, going DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT each time. Both paths are similar in steps. But moving LEFT first might allow more flexibility. Also, moving LEFT first gets me away from the edge, which is safer in case I need to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer to the apple at (5,6) in the Y-axis. Let's count steps:\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6). That's 5 moves. Wait, but the apple is at (5,6). So from (9,7) to (5,6) is 4 steps left and 1 down. Wait, no. Let me calculate the distance. The X difference is 9-5=4, Y difference is 7-6=1. So total steps would be 4 left and 1 down. So 5 steps. But if I move down first to (9,6), then left 4 times: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut moving left first might allow me to approach other apples if needed. Alternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple in Y direction. Hmm.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,9). If they move towards (5,6), they might take a path down and left. For example, from (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then left to (7,8), etc. But that's a longer path. So maybe I can reach (5,6) before them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (3,9). So they might move left from (8,9) to (7,9), then (6,9), etc. So perhaps they are not a threat for the (5,6) apple.\n\nIn that case, moving towards (5,6) is safe. So which direction first? LEFT or DOWN.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7) is moving towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is moving towards the bottom. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. So moving left first might be better to get into the center where there are more options.\n\nBut also, if I move LEFT, I need to make sure that the next moves are possible. For example, after moving left to (8,7), next move could be LEFT again to (7,7), but that's not getting me closer to the apple. Wait, no. The apple is at (5,6). So from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) is better. Then left to (7,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (9,6), then left each time. Either way, same steps. So maybe the first move is a matter of which path is safer.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,9). If I move left to (8,7), that's two steps below them. They might move down towards (8,8), but that's still not a collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,6) is also safe. So both directions are safe. Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the next direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple now is (5,6), which is at (5,6). From my current position (8,7), moving left would take me to (7,7), moving down to (8,6), or moving up to (8,8). Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,7):** This continues moving towards the center. From there, I can proceed left again towards (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on. However, this path might take longer to reach (5,6) compared to moving down first.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** This directly reduces the Y-coordinate, bringing me closer to the apple at (5,6). From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), and finally (5,6) would be a straight path. This seems efficient.\n\n3. **UP to (8,8):** Moving up would take me away from the apple at (5,6) and closer to the enemy snake at (7,9). This might be risky if the enemy moves towards me. Also, there's an apple at (3,9) in that direction, but it's farther away.\n\nConsidering efficiency, moving down to (8,6) seems better as it shortens the distance to the apple. Checking for safety: the enemy is at (7,9). Their possible moves are left to (6,9), down to (7,8), or right to (8,9). None of these positions interfere with my path to (8,6). Therefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples closer now? The apple at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is further down. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. The apple at (1,9) is far left but in the top row. The apple at (3,9) is also in the top left. Since (5,6) is the closest, focusing on that is optimal.\n\nNext, check if moving down leads into any immediate danger. The position (8,6) is empty according to the board state. The enemy snake is at (7,9), so their movement won't affect this path immediately. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,6), getting closer to the apple at (5,6) efficiently and safely.\n</think>\n\nDirection: DOWN"

Wait, the apple at (5,6) was just eaten by me when I moved left to (6,6) and then another left to (5,6)? Wait, no. Wait, the previous move was direction LEFT, which took me from (7,6) to (6,6). But the apple at (5,6) is still there. So now, after moving left once, I'm at (6,6). The apple at (5,6) is one more step to the left.\n\nSo now, my next move should be to go left again to (5,6) to eat that apple. Let me check the possible directions again. From (6,6), possible moves are LEFT to (5,6), RIGHT to (7,6), UP to (6,7), or DOWN to (6,5). \n\nThe apple at (5,6) is directly to the left. Moving LEFT would get me there, eat the apple, and grow. That's the priority. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (4,9) (since last turn's info said snake #1 is at (4,9) with body at []). So their position is not near (5,6). \n\nOther apples: (6,3) is down from my current position. But (5,6) is closer. So moving left is still the best option. \n\nCheck for walls: (5,6) is within the 0-9 grid. No problem. \n\nNo other snakes in the vicinity. My body is still empty, so no risk of collision with myself. \n\nSo the best move is LEFT to (5,6) to eat the apple. That gives me a point and increases my length. Next turn, I'll have a body segment, so I need to be careful not to reverse direction. But since I'm moving left now, next turn I can't go right (since that would be into my own body if I have one). But since I just ate the apple, my body will start growing. Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (5,6), the next move will have the body segment at (6,6). So if I move left again, the body follows. So next turn, I need to avoid moving right back to (6,6) because that's where my body will be. \n\nBut for this current move, moving left is safe and gets the apple. So direction LEFT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's assess the current situation. My snake (ID 2) is at position (5,6) with the body segment at (6,6). The apples are at (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), and (2,0). Wait, looking back at the board state, the apples are listed as (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0). But in the board diagram, there's an 'A' at (5,6) in row 6, which is the current position of my snake's head. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state shows row 6 as: 6 . . . . . 2 T A . . So at (5,6) (x=5, y=6) is the snake's head (2), then T (tail?) at (6,6), and an apple (A) at (7,6). Wait, the coordinates are (x,y) where x is the horizontal (columns 0-9) and y is vertical (rows 0-9). So row 6 (y=6) has columns 0-9. The row is written as: 6 . . . . . 2 T A . . So positions (5,6) is snake 2's head, (6,6) is T (tail?), and (7,6) is an apple (A). So the apple at (7,6) is to the right of my current position. But in the initial list, the apples are at (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0). So the apple at (7,6) is present. \n\nWait, but my current position is (5,6) with body at [(6,6)]. So after moving left from (6,6) to (5,6) in the last move, the apple at (7,6) is still there. So now, my head is at (5,6), body at (6,6). The apples available are (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0). \n\nSo the closest apple is (7,6), which is two steps to the right. But moving right from (5,6) would take me to (6,6), which is my own body. That's a collision. So I can't go right. \n\nOther apples: (6,3) is at y=3, so three down from my current y=6. (5,1) is further down. (1,9) is top left. (2,0) is bottom. \n\nSo possible directions from (5,6): \n\n- UP: (5,7). Check if there's anything there. The board shows row 7 as all dots except for (7,6) which is the apple. So (5,7) is empty. \n\n- DOWN: (5,5). Also empty. \n\n- LEFT: (4,6). Empty. \n\n- RIGHT: (6,6) which is my body. So invalid. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (7,6) is to the right, but that's blocked. The next closest apple is (6,3) at (6,3). To get there from (5,6), I need to move down and right. But moving right is blocked. So maybe go down first. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,1) is directly below. From (5,6) to (5,1) is 5 steps down. But that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,0) is at the bottom left. That's even further. \n\nThe apple at (1,9) is top left, but enemy snake #1 is at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]. So that area might be risky. \n\nSo the nearest accessible apple is (6,3). To reach (6,3), I need to go down from (5,6) to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). But that's three moves. Alternatively, maybe go left to (4,6), then down, but that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right towards (7,6) once possible. But after moving up, next move could be right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). But that's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as my current position, but blocked by my own tail. So maybe I need to find a path around. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6), then down towards (4,5), etc. \n\nBut perhaps the safest immediate move is to go down towards (5,5), avoiding any immediate danger and moving towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nWait, but moving down from (5,6) to (5,5) is safe. Then next move could be right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) and then down. But that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7) to explore the upper area. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake at (3,9), which is far away, maybe not a threat right now. \n\nSo the priority is to reach an apple without colliding. The closest accessible apple is (6,3). So moving down towards that direction. \n\nBut first, check if moving down is safe. From (5,6) to (5,5). The board shows row 5 as all dots except for (5,1) which is an apple. So (5,5) is empty. \n\nSo moving DOWN to (5,5) is safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then proceeding. \n\nBut which direction gives the best path? \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), etc., but that's moving away from the apple at (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but that's moving towards the apple at (7,6). However, after moving up, the next move to the right would be (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6). But that's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as my current position but blocked by my tail. So perhaps that's not the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then proceeding left or down. \n\nBut perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the apple at (6,3) by moving down. \n\nSo the possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or UP. \n\nWhich is the best? \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,5), that's safe. Then next move can be RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down. \n\nBut moving down seems more direct. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's moving away from the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row, but blocked. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (5,1) is a long-term goal. \n\nBut given the options, moving DOWN towards (6,3) seems better. \n\nSo the immediate move is DOWN. \n\nWait, but after moving down to (5,5), the next move would be to (5,4), then (5,3), etc., but that's not towards (6,3). Wait, no. To reach (6,3), I need to move right from (5,5) to (6,5), then down. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the only way to get to (6,3) is to first move down, then right. \n\nSo moving DOWN now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down. \n\nBut that's moving away from the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right. \n\nBut that's moving towards the apple at (7,6), but after moving up, the next move right would be (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, after moving up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, after moving up to (5,7), then up again to (5,8), etc. \n\nBut that's not helpful. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Moving DOWN towards (6,3) \n\n- Moving LEFT to (4,6) \n\n- Moving UP to (5,7) \n\nWhich is the best? \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three moves away if I go down now. \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is three moves away if I go up and then right. \n\nThe apple at (5,1) is five moves down. \n\nThe apple at (2,0) is far. \n\nThe apple at (1,9) is far and near enemy snake. \n\nSo between (6,3) and (7,6), which is better? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can reach it. But currently, moving right is blocked by my own tail. \n\nSo perhaps the best path is to move up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). That's three moves. \n\nSo both apples are three moves away. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nIf I move up, the path is (5,7) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 (7,6). \n\nBut after moving up, the next move to (6,7) is safe. Then to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut during that time, other snakes might take the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down towards (6,3). \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, from (5,6) to (7,6) is two steps right, but blocked by my tail. So I need to go around. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6), then up to (4,7), then right to (5,7), then right to (6,7), etc. That's longer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nSo that's another path. \n\nSo from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nBut that's the same as the other path. \n\nSo both apples are three moves away. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nThe path to (7,6) requires moving through (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6). \n\nThe path to (6,3) requires moving through (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,6) is more urgent because it's in the same row but blocked. \n\nBut given that I can't move right now to (6,6), I need to find a way around. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving left to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's moving away from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go down to (5,5) to start heading towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) to explore other areas. \n\nBut without knowing the future moves, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving down to (5,5), my body will be at (5,6) and (6,6). So next move, I can't go back up to (5,6). \n\nBut that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) would leave my body at (5,6) and (6,6). \n\nSo either way, the body is following. \n\nSo which direction gives the best path towards an apple? \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three moves away if I go down now. \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is three moves away if I go up now. \n\nBut which path is less likely to be blocked by other snakes or myself? \n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,9), which is far away. So probably not a threat. \n\nSo both paths are safe. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can reach it. \n\nBut moving up now to (5,7) and then right. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5) and then right. \n\nBut which path is shorter? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is two steps right from (5,6), but blocked. \n\nThe path via up is three steps. \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three steps down and right. \n\nSo both are three steps. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is more urgent because it's in the same row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake #1 is moving towards (1,9), but that's not near. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go down to (5,5) to start moving towards (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) to avoid potential collisions. \n\nBut moving left doesn't directly help towards any apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7) to start the path towards (7,6). \n\nBut I need to choose between these options. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating an apple, the snake grows. So if I can reach an apple in three moves, I can grow and have more body segments. \n\nBut which apple is safer to go for? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is in the same row but requires a detour. \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is down and right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,1) is a long-term goal. \n\nBut given the current options, I think moving down to (5,5) is a safe move towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Now, possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current head is at (5,5), body at (5,6). So moving UP would go back to (5,6), which is my own body. That's a collision. So UP is invalid. So possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n- DOWN: (5,4). Is that safe? The board shows row 4 as all dots. So yes, safe.\n\n- LEFT: (4,5). Check the board. Row 5's column 4 is empty. So safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (6,5). Check row 5's column 6. The board shows row 5 as . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is the body. Wait, no. Wait, the current position after moving down to (5,5) would have the body at (5,6). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe? Because (6,5) is in row 5, column 6. The board's row 5 shows (5,5) as the head, and (5,6) as part of the body. Wait, no. The snake's body is [(5,6)] from the initial state. After moving down to (5,5), the new body would be [(5,5), (5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and the tail follows. Wait, in the initial state, the snake was at (5,5) with body at [(5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem says: \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5, 5) with body at [(5, 6)]\". So the head is at (5,5), and the body segment is at (5,6). So after moving DOWN to (5,4), the new head is (5,4), and the body becomes [(5,5), (5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, in Snake, when you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. So if the snake was head at (5,5) and body at (5,6), moving DOWN to (5,4) would make the new head (5,4), and the body would be [(5,5)]. The tail (5,6) would move to (5,5). So the body after moving DOWN would be [(5,5)]. Wait, but the initial body is [(5,6)], so after moving down, the body becomes [(5,5)] because the tail follows. So the snake's length is 2: head at (5,5) and body at (5,6). After moving down, the head is at (5,4), and the body is at (5,5). The tail (5,6) is gone because the snake didn't eat an apple. So the body length remains the same unless an apple is eaten. So in this case, moving DOWN to (5,4) would leave the body at (5,5). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe because (6,5) is empty. Let me check the board again. The board's row 5 (y=5) is: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is the body. Wait, no. Wait, the board's row 5 is written as: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So in row 5 (y=5), the columns are 0-9. So at x=5, y=5, there's the snake's head (2). Then at x=6, y=5, there's nothing (since it's a dot). Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem's board state shows row 5 as: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is part of the body. Wait, but the snake's body is [(5,6)] as per the initial description. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is at (5,5), and the body is at (5,6). So the current position after the last move (DOWN) is head at (5,5), body at (5,6). Now, the next move options are:\n\n- UP: (5,6) which is the body. Invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (5,4). Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (4,5). Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (6,5). Safe.\n\nSo all three directions are possible. Now, which direction leads towards an apple.\n\nApples at (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0).\n\nClosest apples:\n\n- (6,3): from (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). Three moves.\n\n- (7,6): from (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). Three moves.\n\n- (5,1): moving down four times.\n\nSo which path is better? The apple at (6,3) is three moves away, same as (7,6). Let's see possible paths.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,5), then next move can be DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3). That's two more moves after RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then UP to (7,6). Also two more moves after RIGHT.\n\nBut both require moving RIGHT first. So moving RIGHT now would be a step towards both apples. Wait, no. To reach (6,3), after moving RIGHT to (6,5), I need to go down twice. To reach (7,6), after moving RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then UP.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then RIGHT to (6,4), then RIGHT to (7,4), then UP to (7,5), then UP to (7,6). That's longer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) might not be helpful towards any apple.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now seems beneficial as it opens paths to both (6,3) and (7,6). But need to check if moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (6,5): the board shows row 5, column 6 as empty (dot). So yes, safe.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. Then next move can be DOWN to (6,4) towards (6,3) or RIGHT to (7,5) towards (7,6).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,4) would start heading towards (5,1), but that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best immediate move is RIGHT to (6,5) to get closer to both (6,3) and (7,6).\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as (6,5) but two steps right and one up. Moving RIGHT then RIGHT then UP.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT then DOWN twice.\n\nBut which path is shorter? Both require three moves from (5,5).\n\nBut moving RIGHT now allows flexibility. So the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (9,7), which is the bottom right area. The apples are at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), (1,9). The enemy snake is at (8,9). My body is empty, so I'm just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left would take me to (8,7), which is empty. Moving up would go to (9,8), which is also empty. Moving down would be (9,6), but wait, the board's Y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving down from Y=7 would be Y=6. That's still within the board. But where are the apples?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,6) and (6,3). But from (9,7), moving left towards (8,7) and then further left might get me closer to (5,6). Alternatively, moving up to (9,8) and then left towards the apple at (3,9) in the top left. But (3,9) is pretty far. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. If I move down from (9,7) to (9,6), then left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., but that might take a while. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left towards (5,6). But maybe there's a quicker path.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,9). So if I move up to (9,8), then left to (8,8), that's near the enemy's position. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. I need to avoid colliding with them. If I go up, maybe they might move down towards (8,8) or (8,9) could stay there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,7) is safe. Then from there, I can go left again towards (7,7), etc. But the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. So maybe moving down first would get me closer. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nIf I move down to (9,6), that's one step closer to the apple at (5,6). Then from (9,6), moving left each time would get me to (5,6) in four moves. But that's a straight path. However, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) would also approach the apple. But maybe moving left first is better to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,9). So if I move left to (8,7), that's two rows below them. They might be moving towards the apple at (3,9) which is in the top left. So maybe they are heading left or down. If I move left, I can start moving towards the center where the apples are.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,8) might not be safe because the enemy is at (8,9). If I go up, then next move I could go left to (8,8), but the enemy could be moving down to (8,8) as well. That's a possible collision. So maybe moving up is risky.\n\nWhat about moving right? Wait, I'm at (9,7). Moving right would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's a wall. So right is invalid. So possible directions are left, up, or down.\n\nDown to (9,6) is safe. Then from there, left towards the apple. Let's see: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's four moves to reach the apple. But each move left would get me closer. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left. That's the same number of steps but maybe a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (8,7) and then up to (8,8) to approach the apple at (3,9). But that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top left. From (9,7), moving left and up would take a while, but maybe that's a safer path if the other apples are contested.\n\nBut the apple at (5,6) is closer. Let's check the positions again. The apple at (5,6) is at (5,6). So from (9,7), moving left and down would get me there. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is in the top right. So they might be going for the apple at (3,9) or (5,6). If I can reach (5,6) before them, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is at (6,3). That's lower down. Maybe moving down and left towards that. But that's further away. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. So the closest apples are (5,6) and (3,9). (5,6) is in the middle, (3,9) is top left.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT to (8,7): Safe. Then next moves can be left or down. From (8,7), moving down to (8,6) gets closer to (5,6). Then left again.\n\n2. DOWN to (9,6): Safe. Then left towards (8,6), etc.\n\n3. UP to (9,8): Safe, but then moving left towards (8,8) which is near the enemy's position. Risk of collision if enemy moves down.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), next move could be DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc. That path is safe. Alternatively, going DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT each time. Both paths are similar in steps. But moving LEFT first might allow more flexibility. Also, moving LEFT first gets me away from the edge, which is safer in case I need to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer to the apple at (5,6) in the Y-axis. Let's count steps:\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6). That's 5 moves. Wait, but the apple is at (5,6). So from (9,7) to (5,6) is 4 steps left and 1 down. Wait, no. Let me calculate the distance. The X difference is 9-5=4, Y difference is 7-6=1. So total steps would be 4 left and 1 down. So 5 steps. But if I move down first to (9,6), then left 4 times: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut moving left first might allow me to approach other apples if needed. Alternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple in Y direction. Hmm.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,9). If they move towards (5,6), they might take a path down and left. For example, from (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then left to (7,8), etc. But that's a longer path. So maybe I can reach (5,6) before them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (3,9). So they might move left from (8,9) to (7,9), then (6,9), etc. So perhaps they are not a threat for the (5,6) apple.\n\nIn that case, moving towards (5,6) is safe. So which direction first? LEFT or DOWN.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7) is moving towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is moving towards the bottom. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. So moving left first might be better to get into the center where there are more options.\n\nBut also, if I move LEFT, I need to make sure that the next moves are possible. For example, after moving left to (8,7), next move could be LEFT again to (7,7), but that's not getting me closer to the apple. Wait, no. The apple is at (5,6). So from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) is better. Then left to (7,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (9,6), then left each time. Either way, same steps. So maybe the first move is a matter of which path is safer.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,9). If I move left to (8,7), that's two steps below them. They might move down towards (8,8), but that's still not a collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,6) is also safe. So both directions are safe. Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

The apples are still at (3,9), (5,1), (6,3), (5,6), and (1,9). The enemy snake is at (7,9) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the next direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple now is (5,6), which is at (5,6). From my current position (8,7), moving left would take me to (7,7), moving down to (8,6), or moving up to (8,8). Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,7):** This continues moving towards the center. From there, I can proceed left again towards (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on. However, this path might take longer to reach (5,6) compared to moving down first.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** This directly reduces the Y-coordinate, bringing me closer to the apple at (5,6). From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), and finally (5,6) would be a straight path. This seems efficient.\n\n3. **UP to (8,8):** Moving up would take me away from the apple at (5,6) and closer to the enemy snake at (7,9). This might be risky if the enemy moves towards me. Also, there's an apple at (3,9) in that direction, but it's farther away.\n\nConsidering efficiency, moving down to (8,6) seems better as it shortens the distance to the apple. Checking for safety: the enemy is at (7,9). Their possible moves are left to (6,9), down to (7,8), or right to (8,9). None of these positions interfere with my path to (8,6). Therefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples closer now? The apple at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is further down. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. The apple at (1,9) is far left but in the top row. The apple at (3,9) is also in the top left. Since (5,6) is the closest, focusing on that is optimal.\n\nNext, check if moving down leads into any immediate danger. The position (8,6) is empty according to the board state. The enemy snake is at (7,9), so their movement won't affect this path immediately. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,6), getting closer to the apple at (5,6) efficiently and safely.\n</think>\n\nDirection: DOWN"

No immediate obstacles here. The enemy is at (6,9), which is three units up from (6,6), so they might not interfere immediately.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,5):** Moving down would take me away from the apple. Not ideal unless avoiding danger, but there's no danger here.\n\n3. **UP to (8,7):** That's backtracking.

Wait, the apple at (5,6) was just eaten by me when I moved left to (6,6) and then another left to (5,6)? Wait, no. Wait, the previous move was direction LEFT, which took me from (7,6) to (6,6).

From (6,6), possible moves are LEFT to (5,6), RIGHT to (7,6), UP to (6,7), or DOWN to (6,5). \n\nThe apple at (5,6) is directly to the left. Moving LEFT would get me there, eat the apple, and grow.

But since I just ate the apple, my body will start growing. Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (5,6), the next move will have the body segment at (6,6). So if I move left again, the body follows. So next turn, I need to avoid moving right back to (6,6) because that's where my body will be. \n\nBut for this current move, moving left is safe and gets the apple.

But in the board diagram, there's an 'A' at (5,6) in row 6, which is the current position of my snake's head. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state shows row 6 as: 6 . . . . . 2 T A . . So at (5,6) (x=5, y=6) is the snake's head (2), then T (tail?) at (6,6), and an apple (A) at (7,6).

So invalid. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (7,6) is to the right, but that's blocked. The next closest apple is (6,3) at (6,3). To get there from (5,6), I need to move down and right. But moving right is blocked. So maybe go down first. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,1) is directly below. From (5,6) to (5,1) is 5 steps down. But that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,0) is at the bottom left. That's even further. \n\nThe apple at (1,9) is top left, but enemy snake #1 is at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]. So that area might be risky. \n\nSo the nearest accessible apple is (6,3). To reach (6,3), I need to go down from (5,6) to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). But that's three moves. Alternatively, maybe go left to (4,6), then down, but that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right towards (7,6) once possible. But after moving up, next move could be right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). But that's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as my current position, but blocked by my own tail. So maybe I need to find a path around. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6), then down towards (4,5), etc. \n\nBut perhaps the safest immediate move is to go down towards (5,5), avoiding any immediate danger and moving towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nWait, but moving down from (5,6) to (5,5) is safe. Then next move could be right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) and then down. But that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7) to explore the upper area. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake at (3,9), which is far away, maybe not a threat right now. \n\nSo the priority is to reach an apple without colliding. The closest accessible apple is (6,3). So moving down towards that direction. \n\nBut first, check if moving down is safe. From (5,6) to (5,5). The board shows row 5 as all dots except for (5,1) which is an apple. So (5,5) is empty. \n\nSo moving DOWN to (5,5) is safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then proceeding. \n\nBut which direction gives the best path? \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), etc., but that's moving away from the apple at (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but that's moving towards the apple at (7,6). However, after moving up, the next move to the right would be (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6). But that's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as my current position but blocked by my tail. So perhaps that's not the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then proceeding left or down. \n\nBut perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the apple at (6,3) by moving down. \n\nSo the possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or UP. \n\nWhich is the best? \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,5), that's safe. Then next move can be RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down. \n\nBut moving down seems more direct. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's moving away from the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row, but blocked. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (5,1) is a long-term goal. \n\nBut given the options, moving DOWN towards (6,3) seems better. \n\nSo the immediate move is DOWN. \n\nWait, but after moving down to (5,5), the next move would be to (5,4), then (5,3), etc., but that's not towards (6,3). Wait, no. To reach (6,3), I need to move right from (5,5) to (6,5), then down. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the only way to get to (6,3) is to first move down, then right. \n\nSo moving DOWN now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down. \n\nBut that's moving away from the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right. \n\nBut that's moving towards the apple at (7,6), but after moving up, the next move right would be (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, after moving up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, after moving up to (5,7), then up again to (5,8), etc. \n\nBut that's not helpful. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Moving DOWN towards (6,3) \n\n- Moving LEFT to (4,6) \n\n- Moving UP to (5,7) \n\nWhich is the best? \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three moves away if I go down now. \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is three moves away if I go up and then right. \n\nThe apple at (5,1) is five moves down. \n\nThe apple at (2,0) is far. \n\nThe apple at (1,9) is far and near enemy snake. \n\nSo between (6,3) and (7,6), which is better? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can reach it. But currently, moving right is blocked by my own tail. \n\nSo perhaps the best path is to move up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). That's three moves. \n\nSo both apples are three moves away. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nIf I move up, the path is (5,7) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 (7,6). \n\nBut after moving up, the next move to (6,7) is safe. Then to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut during that time, other snakes might take the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down towards (6,3). \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, from (5,6) to (7,6) is two steps right, but blocked by my tail. So I need to go around. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6), then up to (4,7), then right to (5,7), then right to (6,7), etc. That's longer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nSo that's another path. \n\nSo from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nBut that's the same as the other path. \n\nSo both apples are three moves away. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nThe path to (7,6) requires moving through (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6). \n\nThe path to (6,3) requires moving through (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,6) is more urgent because it's in the same row but blocked. \n\nBut given that I can't move right now to (6,6), I need to find a way around. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving left to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's moving away from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go down to (5,5) to start heading towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) to explore other areas. \n\nBut without knowing the future moves, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving down to (5,5), my body will be at (5,6) and (6,6). So next move, I can't go back up to (5,6). \n\nBut that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) would leave my body at (5,6) and (6,6). \n\nSo either way, the body is following. \n\nSo which direction gives the best path towards an apple? \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three moves away if I go down now. \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is three moves away if I go up now. \n\nBut which path is less likely to be blocked by other snakes or myself? \n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,9), which is far away. So probably not a threat. \n\nSo both paths are safe. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can reach it. \n\nBut moving up now to (5,7) and then right. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5) and then right. \n\nBut which path is shorter? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is two steps right from (5,6), but blocked. \n\nThe path via up is three steps. \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three steps down and right. \n\nSo both are three steps. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is more urgent because it's in the same row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake #1 is moving towards (1,9), but that's not near. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go down to (5,5) to start moving towards (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) to avoid potential collisions. \n\nBut moving left doesn't directly help towards any apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7) to start the path towards (7,6). \n\nBut I need to choose between these options. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating an apple, the snake grows. So if I can reach an apple in three moves, I can grow and have more body segments. \n\nBut which apple is safer to go for? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is in the same row but requires a detour. \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is down and right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,1) is a long-term goal. \n\nBut given the current options, I think moving down to (5,5) is a safe move towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. My snake is at (5,5) now, with the body at (5,6). The apples are still at (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0). Last move was DOWN to (5,5). Now, possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current head is at (5,5), body at (5,6). So moving UP would go back to (5,6), which is my own body. That's a collision. So UP is invalid. So possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n- DOWN: (5,4). Is that safe? The board shows row 4 as all dots. So yes, safe.\n\n- LEFT: (4,5). Check the board. Row 5's column 4 is empty. So safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (6,5). Check row 5's column 6. The board shows row 5 as . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is the body. Wait, no. Wait, the current position after moving down to (5,5) would have the body at (5,6). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe? Because (6,5) is in row 5, column 6. The board's row 5 shows (5,5) as the head, and (5,6) as part of the body. Wait, no. The snake's body is [(5,6)] from the initial state. After moving down to (5,5), the new body would be [(5,5), (5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and the tail follows. Wait, in the initial state, the snake was at (5,5) with body at [(5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem says: \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5, 5) with body at [(5, 6)]\". So the head is at (5,5), and the body segment is at (5,6). So after moving DOWN to (5,4), the new head is (5,4), and the body becomes [(5,5), (5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, in Snake, when you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. So if the snake was head at (5,5) and body at (5,6), moving DOWN to (5,4) would make the new head (5,4), and the body would be [(5,5)]. The tail (5,6) would move to (5,5). So the body after moving DOWN would be [(5,5)]. Wait, but the initial body is [(5,6)], so after moving down, the body becomes [(5,5)] because the tail follows. So the snake's length is 2: head at (5,5) and body at (5,6). After moving down, the head is at (5,4), and the body is at (5,5). The tail (5,6) is gone because the snake didn't eat an apple. So the body length remains the same unless an apple is eaten. So in this case, moving DOWN to (5,4) would leave the body at (5,5). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe because (6,5) is empty. Let me check the board again. The board's row 5 (y=5) is: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is the body. Wait, no. Wait, the board's row 5 is written as: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So in row 5 (y=5), the columns are 0-9. So at x=5, y=5, there's the snake's head (2). Then at x=6, y=5, there's nothing (since it's a dot). Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem's board state shows row 5 as: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is part of the body. Wait, but the snake's body is [(5,6)] as per the initial description. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is at (5,5), and the body is at (5,6). So the current position after the last move (DOWN) is head at (5,5), body at (5,6). Now, the next move options are:\n\n- UP: (5,6) which is the body. Invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (5,4). Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (4,5). Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (6,5). Safe.\n\nSo all three directions are possible. Now, which direction leads towards an apple.\n\nApples at (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0).\n\nClosest apples:\n\n- (6,3): from (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). Three moves.\n\n- (7,6): from (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). Three moves.\n\n- (5,1): moving down four times.\n\nSo which path is better? The apple at (6,3) is three moves away, same as (7,6). Let's see possible paths.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,5), then next move can be DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3). That's two more moves after RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then UP to (7,6). Also two more moves after RIGHT.\n\nBut both require moving RIGHT first. So moving RIGHT now would be a step towards both apples. Wait, no. To reach (6,3), after moving RIGHT to (6,5), I need to go down twice. To reach (7,6), after moving RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then UP.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then RIGHT to (6,4), then RIGHT to (7,4), then UP to (7,5), then UP to (7,6). That's longer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) might not be helpful towards any apple.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now seems beneficial as it opens paths to both (6,3) and (7,6). But need to check if moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (6,5): the board shows row 5, column 6 as empty (dot). So yes, safe.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. Then next move can be DOWN to (6,4) towards (6,3) or RIGHT to (7,5) towards (7,6).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,4) would start heading towards (5,1), but that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best immediate move is RIGHT to (6,5) to get closer to both (6,3) and (7,6).\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as (6,5) but two steps right and one up. Moving RIGHT then RIGHT then UP.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT then DOWN twice.\n\nBut which path is shorter? Both require three moves from (5,5).\n\nBut moving RIGHT now allows flexibility. So the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"

But from (9,7), moving left towards (8,7) and then further left might get me closer to (5,6). Alternatively, moving up to (9,8) and then left towards the apple at (3,9) in the top left. But (3,9) is pretty far. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. If I move down from (9,7) to (9,6), then left towards (8,6), (7,6), etc., but that might take a while. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left towards (5,6). But maybe there's a quicker path.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8,9). So if I move up to (9,8), then left to (8,8), that's near the enemy's position. But since their body is empty, maybe they can move in any direction. I need to avoid colliding with them. If I go up, maybe they might move down towards (8,8) or (8,9) could stay there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (8,7) is safe. Then from there, I can go left again towards (7,7), etc. But the apple at (5,6) is at Y=6. So maybe moving down first would get me closer. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nIf I move down to (9,6), that's one step closer to the apple at (5,6). Then from (9,6), moving left each time would get me to (5,6) in four moves. But that's a straight path. However, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) would also approach the apple. But maybe moving left first is better to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,9). So if I move left to (8,7), that's two rows below them. They might be moving towards the apple at (3,9) which is in the top left. So maybe they are heading left or down. If I move left, I can start moving towards the center where the apples are.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,8) might not be safe because the enemy is at (8,9). If I go up, then next move I could go left to (8,8), but the enemy could be moving down to (8,8) as well. That's a possible collision. So maybe moving up is risky.\n\nWhat about moving right? Wait, I'm at (9,7). Moving right would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's a wall. So right is invalid. So possible directions are left, up, or down.\n\nDown to (9,6) is safe. Then from there, left towards the apple. Let's see: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's four moves to reach the apple. But each move left would get me closer. Alternatively, moving left first to (8,7), then down to (8,6), then left. That's the same number of steps but maybe a different path.\n\nAlternatively, moving left first to (8,7) and then up to (8,8) to approach the apple at (3,9). But that's a longer path. The apple at (3,9) is in the top left. From (9,7), moving left and up would take a while, but maybe that's a safer path if the other apples are contested.\n\nBut the apple at (5,6) is closer. Let's check the positions again. The apple at (5,6) is at (5,6). So from (9,7), moving left and down would get me there. The enemy snake is at (8,9), which is in the top right. So they might be going for the apple at (3,9) or (5,6). If I can reach (5,6) before them, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is at (6,3). That's lower down. Maybe moving down and left towards that. But that's further away. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. So the closest apples are (5,6) and (3,9). (5,6) is in the middle, (3,9) is top left.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT to (8,7): Safe. Then next moves can be left or down. From (8,7), moving down to (8,6) gets closer to (5,6). Then left again.\n\n2. DOWN to (9,6): Safe. Then left towards (8,6), etc.\n\n3. UP to (9,8): Safe, but then moving left towards (8,8) which is near the enemy's position. Risk of collision if enemy moves down.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), next move could be DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc. That path is safe. Alternatively, going DOWN to (9,6), then LEFT each time. Both paths are similar in steps. But moving LEFT first might allow more flexibility. Also, moving LEFT first gets me away from the edge, which is safer in case I need to maneuver.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gets me closer to the apple at (5,6) in the Y-axis. Let's count steps:\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6). That's 5 moves. Wait, but the apple is at (5,6). So from (9,7) to (5,6) is 4 steps left and 1 down. Wait, no. Let me calculate the distance. The X difference is 9-5=4, Y difference is 7-6=1. So total steps would be 4 left and 1 down. So 5 steps. But if I move down first to (9,6), then left 4 times: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6). That's 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut moving left first might allow me to approach other apples if needed. Alternatively, moving down first gets me closer to the apple in Y direction. Hmm.\n\nBut the enemy snake is at (8,9). If they move towards (5,6), they might take a path down and left. For example, from (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then left to (7,8), etc. But that's a longer path. So maybe I can reach (5,6) before them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is going for the apple at (3,9). So they might move left from (8,9) to (7,9), then (6,9), etc. So perhaps they are not a threat for the (5,6) apple.\n\nIn that case, moving towards (5,6) is safe. So which direction first? LEFT or DOWN.\n\nAnother consideration: moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7) is moving towards the center. Moving DOWN to (9,6) is moving towards the bottom. The apple at (5,6) is in the middle. So moving left first might be better to get into the center where there are more options.\n\nBut also, if I move LEFT, I need to make sure that the next moves are possible. For example, after moving left to (8,7), next move could be LEFT again to (7,7), but that's not getting me closer to the apple. Wait, no. The apple is at (5,6). So from (8,7), moving down to (8,6) is better. Then left to (7,6), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first to (9,6), then left each time. Either way, same steps. So maybe the first move is a matter of which path is safer.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake is at (8,9). If I move left to (8,7), that's two steps below them. They might move down towards (8,8), but that's still not a collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,6) is also safe. So both directions are safe. Which one gives me more options in the next move?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7), next move I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. If I move DOWN to (9,6), next move I can go LEFT or UP. So moving LEFT gives more options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT first might be better for flexibility. Also, moving towards the center could open up paths to other apples if needed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving LEFT doesn't lead me into a trap. Since the enemy is at (8,9), moving left to (8,7) is safe. The enemy's body is empty, so they can't block me with their body. So the only risk is if the enemy moves into the same spot as me in the next turn. But since they are at (8,9), their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT (but they can't go right from (8,9) as X=8, right would be 9, which is allowed. Wait, the board is 0-9. So from (8,9), moving right would take them to (9,9), which is valid. But that's not near my path.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,7), the enemy's possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP. But their current position is (8,9). So UP would be (8,10), which is out of bounds. So they can't move up. So their possible moves are LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8), or RIGHT to (9,9). So moving to (8,7) is safe from their current position. They can't reach me in one move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gives me more options. So I think the best move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next turn, I can move down towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) is also safe, but maybe less flexible. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (3,9) and (1,9). The enemy is at (8,9). So row 9 has two apples and the enemy. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6. So moving towards that apple is a good target.\n\nSo I think moving LEFT first is better. So direction: LEFT.\n</think>\n\nStrategy: Head towards the closest apple at (5,6) by moving left and down, avoiding the enemy snake at (8,9). Next turn, continue moving left towards the apple.\n\nDirection: LEFT"

The board hasn't changed much except my new position.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the next direction to move towards an apple while avoiding collisions. The closest apple now is (5,6), which is at (5,6). From my current position (8,7), moving left would take me to (7,7), moving down to (8,6), or moving up to (8,8). Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7,7):** This continues moving towards the center. From there, I can proceed left again towards (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on. However, this path might take longer to reach (5,6) compared to moving down first.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** This directly reduces the Y-coordinate, bringing me closer to the apple at (5,6). From (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then (6,6), and finally (5,6) would be a straight path. This seems efficient.\n\n3. **UP to (8,8):** Moving up would take me away from the apple at (5,6) and closer to the enemy snake at (7,9). This might be risky if the enemy moves towards me. Also, there's an apple at (3,9) in that direction, but it's farther away.\n\nConsidering efficiency, moving down to (8,6) seems better as it shortens the distance to the apple. Checking for safety: the enemy is at (7,9). Their possible moves are left to (6,9), down to (7,8), or right to (8,9). None of these positions interfere with my path to (8,6). Therefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAnother consideration: Are there any other apples closer now? The apple at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is further down. The apple at (5,1) is even lower. The apple at (1,9) is far left but in the top row. The apple at (3,9) is also in the top left. Since (5,6) is the closest, focusing on that is optimal.\n\nNext, check if moving down leads into any immediate danger. The position (8,6) is empty according to the board state. The enemy snake is at (7,9), so their movement won't affect this path immediately. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (8,6), getting closer to the apple at (5,6) efficiently and safely.\n</think>\n\nDirection: DOWN"

Wait, the apple at (5,6) was just eaten by me when I moved left to (6,6) and then another left to (5,6)? Wait, no. Wait, the previous move was direction LEFT, which took me from (7,6) to (6,6).

The apple at (5,6) is one more step to the left.\n\nSo now, my next move should be to go left again to (5,6) to eat that apple. Let me check the possible directions again. From (6,6), possible moves are LEFT to (5,6), RIGHT to (7,6), UP to (6,7), or DOWN to (6,5). \n\nThe apple at (5,6) is directly to the left. Moving LEFT would get me there, eat the apple, and grow.

But since I just ate the apple, my body will start growing. Wait, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving to (5,6), the next move will have the body segment at (6,6). So if I move left again, the body follows. So next turn, I need to avoid moving right back to (6,6) because that's where my body will be. \n\nBut for this current move, moving left is safe and gets the apple.

But in the board diagram, there's an 'A' at (5,6) in row 6, which is the current position of my snake's head. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the board state again.\n\nThe board state shows row 6 as: 6 . . . . . 2 T A . . So at (5,6) (x=5, y=6) is the snake's head (2), then T (tail?) at (6,6), and an apple (A) at (7,6). Wait, the coordinates are (x,y) where x is the horizontal (columns 0-9) and y is vertical (rows 0-9). So row 6 (y=6) has columns 0-9. The row is written as: 6 . . . . . 2 T A . . So positions (5,6) is snake 2's head, (6,6) is T (tail?), and (7,6) is an apple (A). So the apple at (7,6) is to the right of my current position. But in the initial list, the apples are at (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0). So the apple at (7,6) is present. \n\nWait, but my current position is (5,6) with body at [(6,6)]. So after moving left from (6,6) to (5,6) in the last move, the apple at (7,6) is still there. So now, my head is at (5,6), body at (6,6). The apples available are (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0). \n\nSo the closest apple is (7,6), which is two steps to the right. But moving right from (5,6) would take me to (6,6), which is my own body. That's a collision. So I can't go right. \n\nOther apples: (6,3) is at y=3, so three down from my current y=6. (5,1) is further down. (1,9) is top left. (2,0) is bottom. \n\nSo possible directions from (5,6): \n\n- UP: (5,7). Check if there's anything there. The board shows row 7 as all dots except for (7,6) which is the apple. So (5,7) is empty. \n\n- DOWN: (5,5). Also empty. \n\n- LEFT: (4,6). Empty. \n\n- RIGHT: (6,6) which is my body. So invalid. \n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (7,6) is to the right, but that's blocked. The next closest apple is (6,3) at (6,3). To get there from (5,6), I need to move down and right. But moving right is blocked. So maybe go down first. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,1) is directly below. From (5,6) to (5,1) is 5 steps down. But that's a long path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,0) is at the bottom left. That's even further. \n\nThe apple at (1,9) is top left, but enemy snake #1 is at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]. So that area might be risky. \n\nSo the nearest accessible apple is (6,3). To reach (6,3), I need to go down from (5,6) to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). But that's three moves. Alternatively, maybe go left to (4,6), then down, but that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right towards (7,6) once possible. But after moving up, next move could be right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). But that's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as my current position, but blocked by my own tail. So maybe I need to find a path around. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6), then down towards (4,5), etc. \n\nBut perhaps the safest immediate move is to go down towards (5,5), avoiding any immediate danger and moving towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nWait, but moving down from (5,6) to (5,5) is safe. Then next move could be right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) and then down. But that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7) to explore the upper area. \n\nBut considering the enemy snake at (3,9), which is far away, maybe not a threat right now. \n\nSo the priority is to reach an apple without colliding. The closest accessible apple is (6,3). So moving down towards that direction. \n\nBut first, check if moving down is safe. From (5,6) to (5,5). The board shows row 5 as all dots except for (5,1) which is an apple. So (5,5) is empty. \n\nSo moving DOWN to (5,5) is safe. Then next move could be RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3) to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then proceeding. \n\nBut which direction gives the best path? \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), etc., but that's moving away from the apple at (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right to (6,7), but that's moving towards the apple at (7,6). However, after moving up, the next move to the right would be (6,7), then right again to (7,7), then down to (7,6). But that's three moves. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as my current position but blocked by my tail. So perhaps that's not the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then proceeding left or down. \n\nBut perhaps the best immediate move is to head towards the apple at (6,3) by moving down. \n\nSo the possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or UP. \n\nWhich is the best? \n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,5), that's safe. Then next move can be RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down. \n\nBut moving down seems more direct. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's moving away from the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right. \n\nBut the apple at (7,6) is in the same row, but blocked. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (5,1) is a long-term goal. \n\nBut given the options, moving DOWN towards (6,3) seems better. \n\nSo the immediate move is DOWN. \n\nWait, but after moving down to (5,5), the next move would be to (5,4), then (5,3), etc., but that's not towards (6,3). Wait, no. To reach (6,3), I need to move right from (5,5) to (6,5), then down. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT is blocked by my own body. \n\nSo the only way to get to (6,3) is to first move down, then right. \n\nSo moving DOWN now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,6) and then down. \n\nBut that's moving away from the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,7) and then right. \n\nBut that's moving towards the apple at (7,6), but after moving up, the next move right would be (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, after moving up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut that's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, after moving up to (5,7), then up again to (5,8), etc. \n\nBut that's not helpful. \n\nSo comparing the options: \n\n- Moving DOWN towards (6,3) \n\n- Moving LEFT to (4,6) \n\n- Moving UP to (5,7) \n\nWhich is the best? \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three moves away if I go down now. \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is three moves away if I go up and then right. \n\nThe apple at (5,1) is five moves down. \n\nThe apple at (2,0) is far. \n\nThe apple at (1,9) is far and near enemy snake. \n\nSo between (6,3) and (7,6), which is better? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can reach it. But currently, moving right is blocked by my own tail. \n\nSo perhaps the best path is to move up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). That's three moves. \n\nSo both apples are three moves away. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nIf I move up, the path is (5,7) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 (7,6). \n\nBut after moving up, the next move to (6,7) is safe. Then to (7,7), then down to (7,6). \n\nBut during that time, other snakes might take the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down towards (6,3). \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nWait, from (5,6) to (7,6) is two steps right, but blocked by my tail. So I need to go around. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7), then right to (6,7), then right to (7,7), then down to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6), then up to (4,7), then right to (5,7), then right to (6,7), etc. That's longer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nSo that's another path. \n\nSo from (5,6), moving down to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). That's three moves. \n\nBut that's the same as the other path. \n\nSo both apples are three moves away. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nThe path to (7,6) requires moving through (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6). \n\nThe path to (6,3) requires moving through (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,6) is more urgent because it's in the same row but blocked. \n\nBut given that I can't move right now to (6,6), I need to find a way around. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving left to (4,6) and then down to (4,5), but that's moving away from both apples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go down to (5,5) to start heading towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) to explore other areas. \n\nBut without knowing the future moves, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving down to (5,5), my body will be at (5,6) and (6,6). So next move, I can't go back up to (5,6). \n\nBut that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) would leave my body at (5,6) and (6,6). \n\nSo either way, the body is following. \n\nSo which direction gives the best path towards an apple? \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three moves away if I go down now. \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is three moves away if I go up now. \n\nBut which path is less likely to be blocked by other snakes or myself? \n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,9), which is far away. So probably not a threat. \n\nSo both paths are safe. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is closer in terms of steps if I can reach it. \n\nBut moving up now to (5,7) and then right. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,5) and then right. \n\nBut which path is shorter? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is two steps right from (5,6), but blocked. \n\nThe path via up is three steps. \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is three steps down and right. \n\nSo both are three steps. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (7,6) is more urgent because it's in the same row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake #1 is moving towards (1,9), but that's not near. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to go down to (5,5) to start moving towards (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,6) to avoid potential collisions. \n\nBut moving left doesn't directly help towards any apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,7) to start the path towards (7,6). \n\nBut I need to choose between these options. \n\nAnother consideration: after eating an apple, the snake grows. So if I can reach an apple in three moves, I can grow and have more body segments. \n\nBut which apple is safer to go for? \n\nThe apple at (7,6) is in the same row but requires a detour. \n\nThe apple at (6,3) is down and right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,1) is a long-term goal. \n\nBut given the current options, I think moving down to (5,5) is a safe move towards the apple at (6,3). \n\nSo the next move should be DOWN.\n</think>\n\nDOWN"

Now, possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, current head is at (5,5), body at (5,6). So moving UP would go back to (5,6), which is my own body. That's a collision. So UP is invalid. So possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n- DOWN: (5,4). Is that safe? The board shows row 4 as all dots. So yes, safe.\n\n- LEFT: (4,5). Check the board. Row 5's column 4 is empty. So safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (6,5). Check row 5's column 6. The board shows row 5 as . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is the body. Wait, no. Wait, the current position after moving down to (5,5) would have the body at (5,6). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe? Because (6,5) is in row 5, column 6. The board's row 5 shows (5,5) as the head, and (5,6) as part of the body. Wait, no. The snake's body is [(5,6)] from the initial state. After moving down to (5,5), the new body would be [(5,5), (5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and the tail follows. Wait, in the initial state, the snake was at (5,5) with body at [(5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem says: \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5, 5) with body at [(5, 6)]\". So the head is at (5,5), and the body segment is at (5,6). So after moving DOWN to (5,4), the new head is (5,4), and the body becomes [(5,5), (5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, in Snake, when you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. So if the snake was head at (5,5) and body at (5,6), moving DOWN to (5,4) would make the new head (5,4), and the body would be [(5,5)]. The tail (5,6) would move to (5,5). So the body after moving DOWN would be [(5,5)]. Wait, but the initial body is [(5,6)], so after moving down, the body becomes [(5,5)] because the tail follows. So the snake's length is 2: head at (5,5) and body at (5,6). After moving down, the head is at (5,4), and the body is at (5,5). The tail (5,6) is gone because the snake didn't eat an apple. So the body length remains the same unless an apple is eaten. So in this case, moving DOWN to (5,4) would leave the body at (5,5). So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe because (6,5) is empty. Let me check the board again. The board's row 5 (y=5) is: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is the body. Wait, no. Wait, the board's row 5 is written as: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So in row 5 (y=5), the columns are 0-9. So at x=5, y=5, there's the snake's head (2). Then at x=6, y=5, there's nothing (since it's a dot). Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem's board state shows row 5 as: 5 . . . . . 2 . . . . So (5,5) is the head, and (5,6) is part of the body. Wait, but the snake's body is [(5,6)] as per the initial description. So after moving DOWN to (5,5), the head is at (5,5), and the body is at (5,6). So the current position after the last move (DOWN) is head at (5,5), body at (5,6). Now, the next move options are:\n\n- UP: (5,6) which is the body. Invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (5,4). Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (4,5). Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (6,5). Safe.\n\nSo all three directions are possible. Now, which direction leads towards an apple.\n\nApples at (5,1), (6,3), (1,9), (7,6), (2,0).\n\nClosest apples:\n\n- (6,3): from (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then down to (6,3). Three moves.\n\n- (7,6): from (5,5), moving right to (6,5), then right to (7,5), then up to (7,6). Three moves.\n\n- (5,1): moving down four times.\n\nSo which path is better? The apple at (6,3) is three moves away, same as (7,6). Let's see possible paths.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,5), then next move can be DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3). That's two more moves after RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then UP to (7,6). Also two more moves after RIGHT.\n\nBut both require moving RIGHT first. So moving RIGHT now would be a step towards both apples. Wait, no. To reach (6,3), after moving RIGHT to (6,5), I need to go down twice. To reach (7,6), after moving RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then UP.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then RIGHT to (6,4), then RIGHT to (7,4), then UP to (7,5), then UP to (7,6). That's longer.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,5) might not be helpful towards any apple.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now seems beneficial as it opens paths to both (6,3) and (7,6). But need to check if moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (6,5): the board shows row 5, column 6 as empty (dot). So yes, safe.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe. Then next move can be DOWN to (6,4) towards (6,3) or RIGHT to (7,5) towards (7,6).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (5,4) would start heading towards (5,1), but that's a longer path.\n\nSo the best immediate move is RIGHT to (6,5) to get closer to both (6,3) and (7,6).\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (7,6) is in the same row as (6,5) but two steps right and one up. Moving RIGHT then RIGHT then UP.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT then DOWN twice.\n\nBut which path is shorter? Both require three moves from (5,5).\n\nBut moving RIGHT now allows flexibility. So the next move should be RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT"
