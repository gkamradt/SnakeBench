Going Left would get me closer to (0,8) and (2,9).\n\nLet's consider snake #2. If I go UP, snake #2 could go left to (4,9) and block me. If I go LEFT, snake #2 could go down to (5,8) and eat my tail.\n\nLet's calculate the distance for both options:\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 9):\n- Closest apples: (2,9) - distance of 2, (0,9) - distance of 4\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 8):\n- Closest apples: (0,8) - distance of 3, (2,9) - distance of 2\n\nLooks like they are about the same, but the apple to the LEFT is more open.
